Therefore, the rights, privileges and interests of Developer under this Agreement shall not be assigned, sold, transferred, leased, divided or encumbered, voluntarily or involuntarily, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of El Pollo Loco, which consent may be given or withheld as El Pollo Loco's sole and absolute right. For purposes of this Section, a sale of stock, or any membership or partnership interest in Developer, or a merger or other combination of Developer shall be considered a transfer of Developer's interest prohibited hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Developer shall be permitted to assign business organizations to serve as Franchisee after Developer individually executes the Franchise Agreements, provided the ownership mirrors that of Developer (e.g., Developer consists of persons A (50%), B (25%) and C (25%). Franchisee also must be owned and controlled by the same three (3) persons with each retaining the same percentage of ownership). All other entity structures shall require the prior written approval of Franchisor. Developer shall pay an administrative fee of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) per transfer for each permitted transfer to an Entity where such transfer is for the convenience of ownership only and does not involve a change of principals of the business. Where Developer desires to add new principals to the Developer or any Franchisee entity, Developer shall pay to Franchisor an additional Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500) per new principal to cover Franchisor's administrative costs for reviewing the application and suitability of each new principal as participants in the franchise business.", "text": "8.2.
