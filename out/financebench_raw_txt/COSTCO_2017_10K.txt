PART I
Item 1—Business
Costco
 Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are principallyengaged
 in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan,Australia,
 Spain, France, Iceland and through majority-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Korea. Costco operated 741 , 715, and 686 warehousesworldwide
 at September  3, 2017 , August 28, 2016 ,  and August  30, 2015 ,  respectively. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global SelectMarket, under the symbol “COST.”
We report on a
 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen, four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first threequarters
 consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). Thematerial
 seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2017 relate  to the53-week
 fiscal year ended September  3, 2017 .  References to 2016 and 2015 relate  to the 52-week fiscal  years  ended August  28, 2016 ,  andAugust 30, 2015 
, respectively. General
We
 operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded andprivate-label products in a wide range
 of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined withthe
 operating  efficiencies  achieved  by  volume  purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-servicewarehouse
 facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandisecosts)
 than most other retailers.  We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early paymentdiscounts when available.
We
 buy  most  of  our  merchandise  directly  from  manufacturers  and  route  it  to  cross-docking  consolidation  points  (depots)  or  directly  to  ourwarehouses.
 Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to individual warehouses. This process createsfreight volume and handling efficie
ncies, eliminating many costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.3

Table of ContentsItem 1—Business (Continued)
Our
 average warehouse space is approximately 145,000 square feet, with newer units slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy andefficiency
 in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by thequality of merchandise and low prices, our wareh
ouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and usinga membership format, we have inventory losses (shrinkage) well bel
ow those of typical retail operations.Our
 warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours ofoperation
 are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to thevolume
 of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing laborrequired.
 In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit, including the Costco co-branded card, and debit cards, cash,and checks.
Our
 strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere.We
 seek to limit items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,800 active stock keeping units (SKUs) perwarehous
e in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case,carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.
In
 keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day
 return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverageis sold on certain electronic items.
We offer merchandise in the following categories:
•
Foods (including dry foods, packaged foods, and groc eries)•
Sundries (including snack foods , candy, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and cleaning supplies)•
Hardlines (including major applianc es, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden and patio)•
Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery) •
Softlines (including apparel and s mall appliances)•
Ancillary (including gas stations and pharmacy) Ancillary
 businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services, encouraging members to shop more frequently.These
 businesses  include  our  gas  stations,  pharmacy,  optical  dispensing  centers,  food  courts,  and  hearing-aid  centers.  We  sell  gasoline  in  allcountries
 except Korea and France, with the number of warehouses with gas stations varying significantly by country. We operated 536, 508, and472 gas stations at the end of 
2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. Our
 online businesses, which include e-commerce, business delivery, and travel, vary by country. In the U.S. and Canada, we offer all of our onlinebusinesses.
 We operate e-commerce websites in all countries except Japan, Australia, Spain, Iceland, and France. Online businesses provide ourmembers additiona
l products and services, many not found in our warehouses. Net sales for our online business were approximately 4% of our totalnet sales in 
2017 and 2016 , respectively, and 3% in 2015 . We
 have  direct  buying  relationships  with  many  producers  of  national  brand-name  merchandise.  We  do  not  obtain  a  significant  portion  ofmerchandise
 from any one supplier. We generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that ifone
 or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption ofour
 business. We also purchase private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are comparable and the value to our membersis significant.

 financial  information  for  our  segments  and  geographic  areas  is  included  in  Note  11  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  inItem 8 of this Report.
Membership
Our
 members may utilize their memberships at any of our warehouses worldwide. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Businessmemberships
 are  limited  to  businesses,  including  individuals  with  a  business  license,  retail  sales  license  or  comparable  evidence.  Businessmembers
 have the ability to add additional cardholders (add-ons). Add-ons are not available for Gold Star members. Effective June 1, 2017, weincrease
d our annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star (individual), Business and Business add-on by $5 to $60 per year. TheExecutive
 membership fee increased from $110 to $120 (annual membership fee of $60, plus Executive upgrade of $60), and the maximum annual2%
 reward, which is earned on qualified purchases and can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses, increased from $750 to $1,000. Our annualmembership fees in our Other International operations vary by country. All paid membersh
ips include a free household card.Our
 member renewal rate was 90% in  the U.S. and Canada and 87% on  a worldwide basis in 2017 .  The majority of members renew within sixmonths
 following their renewal date. Therefore, our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteenmonths prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):
 
2017   2016   2015 Gold Star
38,600   36,800   34,000 Business, including add-ons
10,800   10,800   10,600      Total paid members
49,400   47,600   44,600 Household cards
40,900   39,100   36,700 Total cardholders
90,300   86,700   81,300 Paid
 cardholders (except Business add-ons) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and the U.K. for anadditional
 annual  fee,  which  varies  by  country.  Executive  members  have  access  to  additional  savings  and  benefits  on  various  business  andconsumer
 services  (except  in Mexico),  such  as auto  and home  insurance,  the  Costco  auto  purchase  program  and check  printing  services.  Theservices
 are generally provided by third-parties and vary by state and country. Executive members represented 38% of  paid members at the end of2017 
. Executive members  generally spend more than other members, and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continuesto increase.
Labor
Our employee count was as follows:
 
2017   2016   2015 Full-time employees
133,000   126,000   117,000 Part-time employees
98,000   92,000   88,000 Total employees
231,000   218,000   205,000 Approximately 
15,600 employees are union employees. We consi der our employee relations to be very good.5

Competition
Our
 industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy,and
 customer  service.  We  compete  on  a  worldwide  basis  with  global,  national,  and  regional  wholesalers  and  retailers,  including  supermarkets,supercenters,
 internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard  discounters,  department  and  specialty  stores,  and  operators  selling  a  single  category  ornarrow
 range of merchandise. Wal-Mart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon.com are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. Wealso compete with warehouse club operati
ons (primarily Wal-Mart’s, Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and nearly every major U.S. and Mexicometropolitan area has multiple club operati
ons.Intellectual Property
We
 believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress, domainnames
 and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in thedevelopment
 and  protection  of  our  well-recognized  brands,  including  the  Costco  Wholesale ® trademarks  and  our  private-label  brand,  KirklandSignature 
® . We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality products, offered to our members at prices that are generally lower thanthose
 for similar national brand products and that they help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers, and generallyearn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales pe
netration of our private label items.We
 rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employeesand
 others to protect our intellectual property rights. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarksare generally valid and may be renew
ed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained.Available Information

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors
The
 risks  described  below  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  We  could  also  beaffected by
 additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us orthat
 we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management '  s Discussion andAnalysis
 of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item    7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item    8 of thisReport.
Business and Operating Risks
We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.
Our
 financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 85% of net salesand
 operating income in 2017 ,  respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 30% of U.S.net
 sales in 2017 .  Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domesticmarkets.
 Any  substantial  slowing  or  sustained  decline  in  these  operations  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business  and  financial  results.Declines
 in  financial  performance  of  our  U.S.  operations,  particularly  in  California,  and  our  Canadian  operations  could  arise  from,  among  otherthings:
 slow  growth  or  declines  in  comparable  warehouse  sales  (comparable  sales);  negative  trends  in  operating  expenses,  including increasedlabor,
 healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts insales
 mix  toward  lower  gross  margin  products;  changes  or  uncertainties  in  economic  conditions  in  our  markets,  including  higher  levels  ofunemployment
 and  depressed  home  values;  and  failing  to  consistently  provide  high  quality  and  innovative  new  products  to  retain  our  existingmember base and attract new members.
We
 may  be  unsuccessful  implementing  our  growth  strategy,  including  expanding  our  business  in  existing  markets  and  new  markets,which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our
 growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and regional depots. We compete with otherretailers
 and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehousesand
 depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local lawsrestricting
 our  operations  and  environmental  regulations,  may  impact  our  ability  to  find  suitable  locations,  and  increase  the  cost  of  sites  and  ofconstructing,
 leasing  and  operating  our  warehouses  and  depots.  We  also  may  have  difficulty  negotiating  leases  or  purchase  agreements  onacceptable
 terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation orexpansion
 plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us, within their jurisdictions. Failure to effectively manage these and othersimilar factors may
 affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect onour future growth and profitability.
We
 seek  to  expand  in  existing  markets  to  attain  a  greater  overall  market  share.  A  new  warehouse  may  draw  members  away  from  our  existingwarehouses and adversely affect their comparable sa
les performance and member traffic.We intend to
 continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity withus,
 attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lack of familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in themarket.
 Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established marketpresence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses an
d new websites will be profitably deployed and, as a result, future profitability could be delayedor otherwise materially adversely affected.

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
Our failure to maintain membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations.
Membership
 loyalty and growth are essential to our business model. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase thepenetration
 of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputationmay
 negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce member renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membershipfee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operatio
ns.We
 sell  many  products  under  our  Kirkland  Signature  brand.  Maintaining  consistent  product  quality,  competitive  pricing,  and  availability  of  theseproducts
 is  essential  to  developing  and  maintaining  member  loyalty.  These  products  also  generally  carry  higher  margins  than  national  brandproducts
 carried  in  our  warehouses  and  represent  a  growing  portion  of  our  overall  sales.  If  the  Kirkland  Signature  brand  experiences  a  loss  ofmember acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results cou
ld be adversely affected.Disruptions in our merchandise distribution could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.
We
 depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. Although we believe thatour
 receiving and distribution process is efficient, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, earthquakes or othercatastrophic
 events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which couldadversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members.
We
 rely  extensively  on  information  technology  to  process  transactions,  compile  results,  and  manage  our  businesses.  Failure  ordisruption
 of  our  primary  and  back-up  systems  could  adversely  affect  our  businesses.  A  failure  to  adequately  update  our  existingsystems and implement new systems could harm our businesses and adversely affect our results of operations.
Given
 the very high volume of transactions we process each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-criticalcomputer
 systems.  Our  systems,  including  our  back-up  systems,  are  subject  to  damage  or  interruption  from  power  outages,  computer  andtelecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal
 or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes andhurricanes, and errors by
 our employees. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments tofix or
 replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in these systems could have a materialadverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We
 are  currently  making,  and  will  continue  to  make,  significant  technology  investments  to  improve  or  replace  critical  information  systems  andprocessing
 capabilities. Failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace would be harmful. The risk ofsystem
 disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process willmitigate
 this  risk.  Excessive  technological  change  could  impact  the  effectiveness  of  adoption,  and  could  make  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  realizebenefits.
 Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or belowour
 needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, thepotential
 problems and interruptions  associated  with implementing technology  initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency  of our operations.These initiatives might not provide the anticip
ated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost.If
 we do not maintain the privacy and security of member-related and other business information, we could damage our reputation withmembers, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation.
We
 receive, retain, and transmit personal information about our members and entrust that information to third-party business associates, includingcloud service providers that perform activities for us. Our

 and  online  businesses  depend  upon  the  secure  transmission  of  encrypted  confidential  information  over  public  networks,  includinginformation
 permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems or those of our business associates, that results in our members ' information
 being obtained by unauthorized persons, could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations,results
 of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a breachcould require that we expend signific
ant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could disrupt our operations.The
 use of data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and state or local level in all of our operating countries.   Privacy
 and information-security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systemschanges
 and the development of new processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations, ourreputation
 could  be  damaged,  possibly  resulting  in  lost  future  business,  and  we  could  be  subjected  to  additional  legal  risk  as  a  result  of  non-compliance.
Our
 security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, internal or external malfeasance, or otherwise,and,
 as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because thetechniques
 used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access,  disable  or  degrade  service,  or  sabotage  systems  change  frequently  and  may  not  immediatelyproduce
 signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them, or implement adequate preventativemeasures. Any such breach or unauthorized access coul
d result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentiallyhave an adverse effect on our business.
We are subject to payment-related risks.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash an
d checks, a select variety of credit and debit cards, and our proprietary cash card.As
 we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraudlosses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other relate
d card acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees.We
 rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards, and our proprietarycash
 card, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject topayment
 card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic fundstransfers,
 which  could  change  over  time.  For  example,  we  are  subject  to  Payment  Card  Industry  Data  Security  Standards  (“PCI  DSS”),  whichcontain
 compliance  guidelines  and  standards  with  regard  to  our  security  surrounding  the  physical  and  electronic  storage,  processing  andtransmission
 of individual cardholder data. In addition, if our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuancecosts,
 subject  to  fines  and  higher  transaction  fees  and  lose  our  ability  to  accept  credit  and/or  debit  card  payments  from  our  members,  and  ourbusiness and operating results coul
d be adversely affected.We might sell products that cause unexpected illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and expose us to l
itigation.If
 our  merchandise  offerings,  such  as  food  and  prepared  food  products  for  human  consumption,  drugs,  children '  s products,  pet  products,  anddurable
 goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members '  expectations regarding safety, we couldexperience
 lost sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of health-related illness or injury toour
 members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including thepresence
 of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling andtransportation
 phases, or faulty design. Our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependenton
 them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations andwork to comply in all material respects
10

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
with
 applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause a health-related illness or injury inthe
 future or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recallsand
 other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fullypursued, negative publicity could
 adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image, and theseeffects could be long term.
We
 may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members,the demand for our products and services, and our market share.
It
 is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on ourability
 to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changingconsumer
 tastes,  preferences  (including  those  relating  to  sustainability  of  product  sources  and  animal  welfare)  and  spending  patterns  couldnegatively
 affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services and our market share. If we are not successful atpredicting our sales trends and adjusting our
 purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns andreduce our operating performance. This could have a
n adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.If
 we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could beadversely impacted.
Multichannel
 retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors.Our
 members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media. Weare
 making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facingtechnology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operati
ons could be adversely affected.Inability
 to attract,  train and retain highly qualified  employees could adversely impact our business,  financial  condition  and results ofoperations.
Our
 success  depends  on  the  continued  contributions  of  members  of  our  senior  management  and  other  key  operations,  merchandising  andadministrative personnel. Failure to identify an
d implement a succession plan for key senior management could negatively impact the business.We
 must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our corevalues.
 Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailingwage
 rates,  and  healthcare  and  other  insurance  costs.  We  compete  with  other  retail  and  non-retail  businesses  for  these  employees  and  investsignific
ant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in thefuture, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, fina
ncial condition and results of operations.We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.
We
 are  predominantly  self-insured,  with  insurance  coverage  for  certain  catastrophic  risks,  for  employee  health  care  benefits,  workers’compensation,
 general  liability,  property  damage,  directors’  and  officers’  liability,  vehicle  liability  and  inventory  loss.  The  types  and  amounts  ofinsurance
 may  vary  from  time  to  time  based  on  our  decisions  with  respect  to  risk  retention  and  regulatory  requirements.  The  occurrence  ofsignificant claims, a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insura
nce or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverseimpact on our financial condition an
d results of operations.11

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
We are primarily self-insured as it relates to
 property damage, due to the substantial premiums required for insurance coverage over physical lossescaused
 by certain natural disasters, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses. Although we maintain specific coverages forlosses
 from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses, we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a resultof
 any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, andbusiness
 interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as any losses to the extentthey exceed our aggregate limits of applicab
le coverages. Such losses could materially impact our cash flow and results of operations.Market and Other External Risks
We
 face  strong  competition  from  other  retailers  and  warehouse  club  operators,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financialcondition and results of operations.
The
 retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with awide
 range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouseclub
 operators,  supermarkets,  supercenters,  internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard  discounters,  and  department  and  specialty  stores.  Suchretailers
 and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise pricing, selection and availability, services, location,convenience, store hours, and the att
ractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobilechannels
 has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop with digital devices, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors mayhave
 greater financial resources, better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively tocompetitive
 pressures, changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financialresults.
General
 economic  factors,  domestically  and  internationally,  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  ofoperations.
Higher
 energy  and  gasoline  costs,  inflation,  levels  of  unemployment,  healthcare  costs,  consumer  debt  levels,  foreign-currency  exchange  rates,unsettled
 financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related togovernment
 fiscal and tax policies including increased duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, and other economic factors couldadversely affect demand for our
 products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory. Pricesof
 certain  commodity  products,  including  gasoline  and  other  food  products,  are  historically  volatile  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  arising  fromchanges in domestic and internationa
l supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodicdelays
 in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affectour
 sales  and  profit  margins.  These  factors  could  also  increase  our  merchandise  costs  and  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses,  andotherwise
 adversely  affect  our  operations  and  financial  results.  General  economic  conditions  can  also  be  affected  by  significant  events  like  theoutbreak of war or acts of terrorism.
Vendors
 may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices in a timely manner or may fail to adhere to our highstandards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.
We depend
 heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continueto
 grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any vendor has the ability to change theterms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selli
ng to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions of our merchandise leading to lossof sales and profits.
12

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
We buy
 from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or theloss
 of  key  vendors  could  negatively  affect  us.  We  may  not  be  able  to  develop  relationships  with  new  vendors,  and  products  from  alternativesources,
 if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors. Because of our efforts to adhere to high qualitystandards
 for  which  available  supply  may  be  limited,  particularly  for  certain  food  items,  the  large  volume  we  demand  may  not  be  consistentlyavailable.
Our
 suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities,financial
 liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their abilityto
 timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. For these or other reasons, one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control,legal,
 regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us andmight
 not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation, and otherwise damage ourreputation and our brands, increase our costs, and otherwise a
dversely impact our business.Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
During 
2017 ,  our international operations, including Canada, generated 27% and 36% of our net sales and operating income, respectively. Ourinternational
 operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare ourconsolidated
 financial statements, we must translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollarsusing exchange rates for the current period. Future fluctuations in currency excha
nge rates over time that are unfavorable to us may adversely affectthe
 financial performance of our Canadian and Other International operations and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on ourresults of operations. As we continue to expand internati
onally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase.We
 may pay for products we purchase for sale in our warehouses around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country inwhich
 the  goods  will  be  sold.  Currency  fluctuations  may  increase  our  cost  of  goods  and  may  not  be  passed  on  to  members.  Consequently,fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
Natural disasters or other catastrophes could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Natural
 disasters,  such  as  hurricanes,  typhoons  or  earthquakes,  particularly  in  California  or  Washington  state,  where  our  centralized  operatingsystems
 and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result inphysical
 damage  to  one  or  more  of  our  properties,  the  temporary  closure  of  one  or  more  warehouses,  depots,  manufacturing  or  home  officefacilities,
 the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some localor
 overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses ordepots
 within the countries in which we operate, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues,whether occurring in
 the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact onconsumer
 spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procureproducts.
 We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and resu
lts of operations.Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.
We
 use natural  gas, diesel fuel,  gasoline,  and electricity  in our distribution  and warehouse operations.  U.S.  and foreign  government  regulationslimiting
 carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energyinputs that could materially affect
13

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
our
 profitability. Climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We alsosell
 a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which could face increasedregulation.
 Climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions, such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, andsnow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels.
Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
We
 believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay inmeeting
 these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new membersign-ups,
 gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the marketprice of our stock to decline.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
Our
 international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economicfactors specific to the countrie
s or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and resultsof operations.
During 
2017 ,  we operated 227 warehouses in 10 countries outside of the U.S., and we plan to continue expanding our international operations.Future
 operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain ofwhich
 are beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, policy changessuch
 as the U.K.'s vote to withdraw from the European Union, commonly known as "Brexit", and other matters in any of the countries or regions inwhich we operate, now or
 in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies andthe
 laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilitieslocated
 in countries which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, thecosts and difficulties of managing internation
al operations, adverse tax consequences, and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.Changes
 in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accountingmatters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Accounting
 principles  and  related  pronouncements,  implementation  guidelines,  and  interpretations  we  apply  to  a  wide range  of  matters  that  arerelevant to
 our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, merchandise inventories, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration,impairment
 of long-lived assets, self-insurance liabilities, and income taxes are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates andjudgments
 by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by ourmanagement could significantly cha
nge our reported or expected financial performance.Provisions
 for  losses  related  to  self-insured  risks  are  generally  based  upon  independent  actuarially  determined  estimates.  The  assumptionsunderlying
 the  ultimate  costs  of  existing  claim  losses  can  be  highly  unpredictable,  which  can  affect  the  liability  recorded  for  such  claims.  Forexample,
 variability in health care cost inflation rates inherent in these claims can affect the amounts recognized. Similarly, changes in legal trendsand
 interpretations, as well as changes in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates ofliabilities
 incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect uponfuture claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and co
uld materially impact our consolidated financial statements.14

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
We could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.
We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the cou
ntries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a changein
 earnings  attributable  to  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate  could  result  in  an  unfavorable  change  in  our  overall  tax  provision.Additionally,
 changes  in  the  enacted  tax  rates,  adverse  outcomes  in  tax  audits,  including  transfer  pricing  disputes,  or  any  change  in  thepronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes co
uld have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Significant
 changes in, or failure to comply with, federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use,storage,
 discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters couldadversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We
 are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge anddisposal
 of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws couldresult
 in  harm  to  our  members,  employees  or  others,  significant  costs  to  satisfy  environmental  compliance,  remediation  or  compensatoryrequirements,
 or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect ourbusiness, financial conditio
n and results of operations.We
 are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations.
Our
 business  requires  compliance  with  many  laws  and  regulations.  Failure  to  achieve  compliance  could  subject  us  to  lawsuits  and  otherproceedings,
 and  lead  to  damage  awards,  fines,  penalties,  and  remediation  costs.  We  are,  or  may  become  involved,  in  a  number  of  legalproceedings
 and  audits  including  grand  jury  investigations,  government  and  agency  investigations,  and  consumer,  employment,  tort,  unclaimedproperty
 laws,  and  other  litigation.  We  cannot  predict  with  certainty  the  outcomes  of  these  proceedings  and  other  contingencies,  includingenvironmental
 remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these proceedings, audits,unclaimed
 property  laws,  and  other  contingencies  could  require  us  to  take,  or  refrain  from  taking,  actions  which  could  negatively  affect  ouroperations
 or  could  require  us  to  pay  substantial  amounts  of  money,  adversely  affecting  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.Additionally,
 defending  against  these  lawsuits  and  proceedings  may  involve  significant  expense  and  diversion  of  management '  s  attention  andresources.

OVERVIEW
We
 believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth. We define comparable sales assales from warehouses open for
 more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, as well as online sales related to e-commercewebsites
 operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existingmembers and the amount
 they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that arebeyond
 our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations);  andchanges
 in  the  cost  of  gasoline  and  associated  competitive  conditions  (primarily  impacting  our  U.S.  and  Canadian  operations).  The  higher  ourcomparable
 sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them asa
 percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our membersthe
 right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor insales
 growth  is  the  health  of  the  economies  in  which  we  do  business,  especially  the  United  States.  Sales  growth  and  gross  margins  are  alsoimpacted
 by our competition,  which is vigorous  and widespread,  across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers  and retailers.While
 we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historicallyin
 adapting  our  business  to  these  changes,  such  as  through  adjustments  to  our  pricing  and  to  our  merchandise  mix,  including  increasing  thepenetration of our private label items.
Our
 philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at the most competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term onmaximizing
 prices  charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our  members  of  our  “pricing  authority”  –consistently
 providing  the  most  competitive  values.  Our  investments  in  merchandise  pricing  can,  from  time  to  time,  include  reducing  prices  onmerchandise
 to  drive  sales  or  meet  competition  and  holding  prices  steady  despite  cost  increases  instead  of  passing  the  increases  on  to  ourmembers,
 all negatively impacting near-term gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe that our gasolinebusiness
 draws  members  but  it  generally  has  a  significantly  lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  non-gasoline  business.  A  higherpenetration
 of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term
 net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our grossmargin
 percentage  but  decreases  our  selling,  general  and  administrative  (SG&A)  expenses  as  a  percentage  of  net  sales.  A  decline  in  gasolineprices has the inverse effect. We operate our lower-margin gasoline bus
iness in all countries except Korea and France.We
 also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable potential sites become moredifficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial compo
nent of growth. The negative aspects of such growth,however,
 including  lower  initial  operating  profitability  relative  to  existing  warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  whenopenings
 occur in existing markets, are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growthis
 generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growthboth domestically and internationa
lly has also increased our sales.Our
 membership format is an integral part of our business model and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforcemember
 loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase penetration of ourExecutive members, and sustain high renewal rates, materially i
nfluences our profitability.Our financial performance depends heavi
ly on our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically,some significant costs are partially outside our control, most

(Continued) particularly
 health care and utility expenses. With respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seekto
 minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancingemployee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better
 than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may causeus, for
 example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business is operated on very lowgross margins, modest changes
 in various items in the income statement, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantialimpacts on net income.
Our
 operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidatedfinancial
 statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of squarefootage growth, lower wages and benefit costs as a percenta
ge of country sales, and/or less or no direct membership warehouse competition.In
 discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which arereferences
 to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from localcurrencies
 into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the differencebetween
 the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on netsales is calculated based on the differenc
e between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal year 
2017 was a 53-week fiscal year ending on September 3, 2017 , while 2016 and 2015 
were  52-week fiscal years ending on August  28, 2016 ,  and August  30, 2015 ,  respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculatedusing actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherw
ise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.Highlights for fiscal year 
2017 included: •
We opened 26 net new warehouses in 2017 : 13 in the U.S., six in Canada, and seven in our  Other International segment, compared to 29 netnew warehouses in 
2016 ; •
Net sales increased 9% to $126,172 ,  driven by a 4% increase in comparable sales, sales at new warehouses opened in 2016 and 2017 , and the benefit of one additional week of sal
es in 2017;•
Membership fee revenue increased 8% to $2,853 ,  primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses, an extra week ofmembership fees in 
2017 , the annual fee increase, and executive membership u pgrades;•
Gross margin percentage decreased two basis points;•
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 14 basis points, driven by lower costs associated with the co-branded credit cardarrangement in 
the U.S.;•
Net income increased 14% to $2,679 ,  or $6.08 per  diluted share compared to $2,350 ,  or $5.33 per  diluted share in 2016 .  The 2017 resultswere
 positively impacted by a $82 tax benefit, or $0.19 per diluted share, in connection with the special cash dividend paid to the Company's401(k) Plan participants and other net benefits of approximate
ly $51, or $0.07 per diluted share, for non-recurring net legal and other matters;•
In 2017, we re-paid long-term debt totaling $2,200 representing the aggregate principal balances of the 5.5% and 1.125% Senior Notes; weissued
 $3,800  in  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Senior  Notes  which  funded  a  special  cash  dividend  of  $7.00  per  share  paid  in  May  2017(approximately $3,100); and
•
In April 2017, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.45 to $0.50 per share.20

Net
 sales increased $10,099 or 9% during 2017 ,  primarily due to a 4% increase in comparable sales, new warehouses opened in 2016 and 2017 , and
 the benefit of one additional week of sales in 2017 .  Changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by approximately $785, or 68basis
 points,  due  to  an  8%  increase  in  the  average  sales  price  per  gallon.  Changes  in  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar  negativelyimpacted
 net  sales  by  approximately  $295,  or  25  basis  points,  compared  to 2016 .  The  negative  impact  was  driven  by  Other  Internationaloperations, partially offset by positive impacts attributable to our Cana
dian operations.Comparable Sales
Comparable
 sales  increased  4%  during 2017 and  were  positively  impacted  by  an  increase  in  shopping  frequency  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  anincreased
 average ticket. The average ticket and comparable sales results were positively impacted by an increase in gasoline prices, offset bydecreases in foreign currencie

vs. 2015Net Sales
Net sales increased 
$2,407 or 2% during 2016. This was attributable to sales at new warehouses opened in 2015 and 2016. Comparable sales wereflat.
 Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $2,690, or 237 basis points, comparedto 2015. The negative impact was primarily attributable to our Can

8 % 4 % 4 %Membership fees as a percentage of net sales
2.26 % 2.28 % 2.23 %2017 
vs. 2016The
 increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses, an extra week of membership feerevenue, the annual fee increase (discusse
d below), and an increased number of upgrades to our higher-fee Executive Membership program. At theend of 
2017 , our member renewal rates were 90% in the U.S. and  Canada and 87% worldwide. In
 the first fiscal quarter of 2017, we increased our annual membership fees in certain of our Other International operations. Effective June 1, 2017,we
 also increased our annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star (individual), Business and Business add-on by $5 to $60 andfor
 Executive Membership from$110 to $120 (annual membership fee of $60, plus the Executive upgrade of $60); and the maximum 2% rewardassociated
 with  Executive  Membership  increased  from  $750  to  $1,000  annually.  We  account  for  membership  fee  revenue  on  a  deferred  basis,recognized
 ratably over the one-year membership period. These fee increases had a positive impact on membership fee revenues during 2017 ofapproximately
 $23 and will positively impact the next several quarters. We expect these increases to positively impact membership fee revenue byapproximately $175 in fiscal 2018.
2016 
vs. 2015The increase in membership fees
 was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and increased upgrades to our higher-fee
 Executive  Membership  program.  These  increases  were  partially  offset  by  changes  in  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar,  whichnegatively impacted fees by approximately $5

 gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage ofcore
 merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased eight basis points due to increases in these categories other than fresh foods. Thismeasure eliminates the impact of changes in sales pe
netration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.Total
 gross margin percentage decreased two basis points compared to 2016. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, grossmargin
 as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.40%, an increase of five basis points. This increase was primarily due to amounts earnedunder
 the co-branded credit card arrangement in the U.S. of 15 basis points and a benefit of three basis points from non-recurring legal settlementsand
 other matters. The improvement in terms in our current co-brand agreement as compared to the prior co-brand arrangement led to substantialyear
 over year benefits in fiscal 2017. Changes of comparable magnitude will not occur in subsequent years. These increases were partially offsetby
 a six basis point decrease in our core merchandise categories, primarily due to food and sundries as a result of a decrease in sales penetration.The
 gross margin percentage was also negatively impacted by five basis points due to a LIFO benefit in 2016 and one basis point in warehouseancillary and other businesses. Cha
nges in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an immaterial impact on gross margin in 2017.Gross
 margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasolineprices
 on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. operations, due to amounts earned under the co-branded credit cardarrangeme

 categories, predominantly food and sundries as a result of a decrease in sales penetration, and a LIFO benefit in 2016. The segmentgross
 margin percentage in our Canadian operations increased, primarily due to increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, primarilyour

 Central  operating  costs  were  higher  by  one  basis  point,  primarily  due  to  increased  costs  associated  with  our  information  systemsmodernization,
 including increased depreciation for projects placed in service, incurred by our U.S. operations. Stock compensation expense wasalso higher by one basis point. Cha

 net sales increased 33 basis points compared to 2015. Excluding the negative impact of gasoline price deflationon
 net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 10.20%, an increase of 13 basis points. This was largely due to: highercentral
 operating costs of six basis points, predominantly due to costs associated with our information systems modernization, including increaseddepreciation
 for projects placed in service, incurred by our U.S. operations; and higher stock compensation expense of four basis points, due toappreciation
 in the trading price of our stock at the time of grant. Charges for non-recurring legal and regulatory matters  during 2016 negativelyimpacted SG&A
 expenses by two basis points. Operating costs related to warehouses, ancillary, and other businesses, which includes e-commerceand
 travel, were higher by one basis point due to higher payroll and employee benefit costs, primarily health care, i n  our U.S. operations. Thisincrease
 was  partially  offset  by  lower  payroll  expense  as  a  percentage  of  net  sales  in  our  Canadian  operations.  Changes  in  foreign  currenciesrelative to the U.S. dollar decreased our SG&A expenses by a

(2,366 )  (2,345 )  (2,480 ) Net cash used in financing activities
(3,218 )  (2,419 )  (2,324 ) Our
 primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Cashand
 cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  were $5,779 and $4,729 at  the  end  of 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively.  Of  these  balances,approximately
 $1,255 and $1,071 represented unsettled credit and debit card receivables, respectively. These receivables generally settle withinfour
 days. Cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by changes in exchange rates of $25 and $50 in 2017 and  2016, respectfully, andnegatively impacted b
y $418 in 2015.We
 have  not  provided  for  U.S.  deferred  taxes  on  cumulative  undistributed  earnings  of  certain  non-U.S.  consolidated  subsidiaries,  including  theremaining
 undistributed  earnings  of  our  Canadian  operations,  because  our  subsidiaries  have  invested  or  will  invest  the  undistributed  earningsindefinitely,
 or the earnings if repatriated would not result in an adverse tax consequence. Although we have historically asserted that certain non-U.S.
 undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested, we may repatriate such earnings to the extent we can do so without an adverse taxconsequence.
 If we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, deferred taxes, to the extent required and applicable, arerecorded
 at  that  time.  During  2017,  we  changed  our  position  regarding  an  additional  portion  of  the  undistributed  earnings  of  our  Canadianoperatio
ns, as we determined such earnings could be repatriated without adverse tax consequences. Subsequent to the end of 2017, we repatriateda portion of our undistributed earnings in our Ca
nadian operations without adverse tax consequences.Management
 believes  that  our  cash  position  and  operating  cash  flows  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  our  liquidity  and  capital  requirements  for  theforeseeable
 future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements and have nocurrent
 plans to repatriate for use in the U.S. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by non-U.S. consolidated subsidiarieswhose
 earnings  are  considered  indefinitely  reinvested.  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  held  at  these  subsidiaries  withearnings considered to be indefi
nitely reinvested totaled $1,463 at September 3, 2017.Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net
 cash provided by operating activities totaled $6,726 in 2017 ,  compared to $3,292 in 2016 .  Our cash flow provided by operations is primarilyderived from
 net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors, warehouseoperating
 costs including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includespayments
 for  income  taxes.  The  increase  in  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  for  2017  when  compared  to  2016  was  primarily  due  toaccelerated vendor
 payments of approximately $1,700 made in the last week of fiscal 2016, in advance of implementing our modernized accountingsystem.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net
 cash used in investing activities totaled $2,366 in 2017 ,  compared to $2,345 in 2016 .  Cash flow used in investing activities is primarily relatedto
 funding  warehouse  expansion  and  remodeling. Net  cash  flows  from  investing  activities  also  includes  purchases  and  maturities  of  short-terminvestments.

 for  initial  warehouse  operations,  our  information  systems,  and  working  capital. We  opened 26 new  warehous es  and  relocated  2warehouses
 in 2017 and  plan to open up to 24 new warehouses and relocate up to six warehouses in 2018 . In 2017 we  spent $2,502 on capital expenditures,
 and it is our current intention to spend approximately $2,500 to $2,700 during fiscal 2018 . These expenditures are expected to befinanced
 with  cash  from  operations,  existing  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term  investments.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  currentexpectations will be realized a
nd plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs.Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net
 cash  used  in  financing  activities  totaled $3,218 in 2017 ,  compared to $2,419 in 2016 .  The  primary  uses  of  cash  in  2017  were  related  todividend
 payments, predominantly the special dividend paid in May 2017, and the repayments of debt totaling $2,200 representing the aggregateprincipal
 balances of the 5.5% and 1.125% Senior Notes. Net cash used in financing activities in 2016 includes a $1,200 repayment of our 0.65%Senior Notes in December 2015.
In
 May 2017, we issued $3,800 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. The proceeds received were net of a discount and used to pay thespecial cash dividend an
d a portion of the redemption of the 1.125% Senior Notes.Stock Repurchase Programs
During 
2017 and 2016 ,  we repurchased 2,998,000 and 3,184,000 shares  of common stock, at average prices of $157.87 and $149.90 ,  totalingapproximately 
$473 and $477 ,  respectively. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $2,749 at  the end of2017 
. These amounts may  differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes inunsettled
 stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or inblock
 purchases  and pursuant  to  plans under  SEC Rule 10b5-1.  Repurchased  shares  are  retired,  in accordance  with  the Washington  BusinessCorporation Act.
Dividends
Cash
 dividends paid in 2017 totaled  $8.90 per share, which included a special cash dividend of $7.00 per share, as compared to $1.70 per share in2016 
. In April 2017 , our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.45 to $0.50 per share. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital an
d general corporate purposes. At September 3, 2017, we had borrowing capacity under thesefacilities
 of $833, including a $400 revolving line of credit entered into by our U.S. operations in June 2017 with an expiration date of one year. TheCompany
 currently has no plans to draw upon the new revolving line of credit. Our international operations maintain $349 of the total borrowingcapacity under bank credit facilities, of
 which $166 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bankcredit facilities at the end of 2017 and 2016.
The Company has letter of
 credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $181. The outstanding standby letters of credit underthese
 facilities at the end of 2017 totaled $103 and expire within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, all within oneyear, and
 we generally intend to renew these facilities prior to their expiration. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank creditfacilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit then outstand
ing.27

The total amount excludes $35 ofnon-current unrecognized tax contingencies and $29 of other obligations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In
 the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current orfuture
 effect on our financial condition or financial statements other than operating leases, included in the table above and discussed in Note 1 andNote 5 to the consolidated financial statements inc
luded in Item 8 of this Report.Critical Accounting Estimates
The
 preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requiresthat
 we make estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long-livedassets, insurance/self-insurance liabil
ities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe tobe
 reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion inNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements inc
luded in Item 8 of this Report.28

Table of ContentsItem 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
(amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data) 
(Continued) Revenue Recognition
We
 generally recognize sales, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, net of returns, at the time the member takes possession ofmerchandise
 or receives services. When we collect payment from members prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance ofservices,
 the amount is generally recorded as deferred sales in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We providefor
 estimated sales returns based on historical trends and reduce sales and merchandise costs accordingly. Our sales returns reserve is based onan estimate of the net
 realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned. Amounts collected from members for sales and value added taxesare recorded on a net basis.
We
 evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or a net amount. Generally, when we arethe
 primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications,or
 have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess otherindicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record a net amount, which is reflecte
d in net sales.We
 account for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executivemembers
 qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of approximately $1,000 per year in the U.S. and Canada andvaries
 in our Other International operations), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. We account for this reward as a reduction insales.
 The  sales  reduction  and  corresponding  liability  are  computed  after  giving  effect  to  the  estimated  impact  of  non-redemptions,  based  onhistorical data.
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories
 are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting, usingthe
 last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matchingcurrent
 costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation ordeflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determin
ed at year-end, after actual inflation rates and inventory levels for the year havebeen
 determined. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valued using the cost and retail inventory methods,respectively, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
We
 provide for estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted to reflectresults of the actual physical inventory counts, which gen
erally occur in the second and fourth quarters.Inventory
 cost,  where  appropriate,  is  reduced  by  estimates  of  vendor  rebates  when  earned  or  as  we  progress  toward  earning  those  rebates,provided
 they  are  probable  and  reasonably  estimable.  Other  consideration  received  from  vendors  is  generally  recorded  as  a  reduction  ofmerchandise costs upon completion of contractual milesto
nes, terms of agreement, or using other systematic approaches.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We
 evaluate  our  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  on  an  annual  basis,  when  relocating  or  closing  a  facility,  or  when  events  or  changes  incircumstances
 occur  that  may  indicate  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be  fully  recoverable.  Our  judgments  are  based  on  existing  market  andoperational
 conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets totheir then-current fair value.

(amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data) 
(Continued) Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities
We
 are  predominantly  self-insured,  with  insurance  coverage  for  certain  catastrophic  risks,  for  employee  health  care  benefits,  workers’compensation,
 general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. We use different mechanismsincluding
 a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and participate in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retainare
 not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarialassumptions.
 The  estimated  accruals  for  these  liabilities  could  be  significantly  affected  if  future  occurrences  and  claims  differ  from  theseassumptions and historical trends.
Income Taxes
The
 determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application ofcomplex
 tax laws. Significant judgment also is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability ofsustaining
 uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded only after determining a more-likely-than-notprobability
 that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these positions andrecord
 any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Our cumulative foreign undistributed earnings, except the additionalportion
 of earnings in Canada, were considered indefinitely reinvested as of September  3, 2017 .  These earnings would be subject to U.S. incometax
 if  we  changed  our  position  and  could  result  in  a  U.S.  deferred  tax  liability.  Although  we  have  historically  asserted  that  certain  non-U.S.undistributed
 earnings  will  be  permanently  reinvested,  we  may  repatriate  such  earnings  to  the  extent  we  can  do  so  without  an  adverse  taxconsequence.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 to the consolidated financi
al statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
(amounts in millions) Our
 exposure  to  financial  market  risk  results  from  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  We  do  not  engage  inspeculative or leveraged transactions or hol
d or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.Interest Rate Risk
Our
 exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instrumentsconsidered
 to be cash equivalents as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term
 investments  in  government  and  agency  securities,  and  asset  and  mortgage-backed  securities  with  effective  maturities  of  generally  threemonths
 to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generateyields.
 The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due tointerest rate fluctuations.
Our
 policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized byU.S.
 government  and  government  agency  obligations,  and  U.S.  government  and  government  agency  money  market  funds.  Our  wholly-ownedcaptive
 insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government and government agency moneymarket funds. Our
 Canadian and Other International subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers’ acceptances, and bankcertificates of deposit, generally denominated i
n local currencies.A
 100  basis-point  change  in  interest  rates  as  of  the  end  of 2017 would  have  an  incremental  change  in  fair  market  value  of  $20.  For  thoseinvestments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrea
lized gains or30

Table of ContentsItem 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
(amounts in millions) (Continued) losses
 related  to fluctuations  in market  volatility  and interest  rates  are reflected  within stockholders’  equity in accumulated  other  comprehensiveincome.
The
 nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of2017 
,  the majority of our long-term debt has fixed interest rates and is carried at $6,632 .  Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value ofthe fixed-rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financi
al statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.Foreign Currency-Exchange Risk
Our
 foreign  subsidiaries  conduct  certain  transactions  in  their  non-functional  currencies,  which  exposes  us  to  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates.  Wemanage
 these  fluctuations,  in  part,  through  the  use  of  forward  foreign-exchange  contracts,  seeking  to  economically  hedge  the  impact  of  thesefluctuations
 on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economicallyhedge
 exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other thanthe U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accou
nting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts anddo not intend to engage in specul
ative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features.We
 seek to  manage counterparty  risk  associated  with  these contracts  by limiting  transactions  to counterparties  with which we have establishedbanking
 relationships. There can be no assurance that this practice is effective. These contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 andNote
 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of unsettled forwardforeign-exchange
 contracts  at  the  end  of 2017 and 2016 .  A  hypothetical  10%  strengthening  of  the  functional  currency  compared  to  the  non-functional currency
 exchange rates at September 3, 2017 would have  decreased the fair value of the contracts by $69 and resulted in an unrealizedloss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount.
Commodity Price Risk
We
 are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigatethrough
 fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced
 contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meetthe
 characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidanceand require no mark-to-market adjustment.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As
 of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  we  performed  an  evaluation  under  the  supervision  and  with  theparticipat
ion of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as definedin
 Rules  13a-15(e)  or  15d-15(e)  under  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Act  of  1934  (the  Exchange  Act)).  Based  upon  that  evaluation,  our  ChiefExecutive
 Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls andprocedures are effective.
There has
 been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during ourfiscal
 quarter ended September  3, 2017 ,  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financialreporting.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing a
nd maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) underthe Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting
32

Table of ContentsItem 9A—Controls and Procedures (Continued)
is
 designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for externalpurposes
 in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP  and  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that:  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that  inreasonable
 detail  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  our  transactions  and  the  dispositions  of  our  assets;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  ourtransactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principlesand
 that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assuranceregarding prevention or timely detection of unauth
orized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financialstatements.
Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systemsdetermined to be effective can provide only reasona
ble assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.Under the supervision and with the
 participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting asof 
September 3, 2017 ,  using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in InternalControl—Integrated
 Framework (2013). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting waseffective
 as of September  3, 2017 .  The attestation of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of ourinternal control over financial reporting is inc
luded with the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report./s/    W. C

Costco Wholesale Corporation:
We
 have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation as of September  3, 2017 and August 28, 2016 , and
 the  related  consolidated  statements  of  income,  comprehensive  income,  equity,  and  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  53-week  period  endedSeptember
 3,  2017 and  the  52-week  periods  ended August  28,  2016 and August  30,  2015 .  These  consolidated  financial  statements  are  theresponsibility
 of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on ouraudits.
We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standardsrequire that we
 plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.An
 audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includesassessing
 the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statementpresentation. We believe that our audits provide a reaso
nable basis for our opinion.In
 our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  CostcoWholesale
 Corporation and subsidiaries as of September  3, 2017 and August 28, 2016 ,  and the results of their operations and their cash flows forthe
 53-week  period  ended September  3,  2017 ,  and  the  52-week  periods  ended August  28,  2016 and August  30,  2015 ,  in  conformity  withU.S. generally accep

Costco Wholesale Corporation:
We
 have  audited  Costco  Wholesale  Corporation’s  (the  Company)  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of September  3,  2017 ,  based  oncriteria
 established  in Internal  Control  —  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  TreadwayCommission
 (COSO).  The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  itsassessment
 of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on InternalControl
 over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financialreporting based on our audit.
We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standardsrequire
 that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  wasmaintained
 in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk thata
 material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Ouraudit
 also  included  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered  necessary  in  the  circumstances.  We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  areasonable basis for our opinion.
A
 company’s  internal  control  over  financial reporting  is a process  designed to  provide  reasonable assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Acompany’s
 internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, inreasonab
le detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance thattransactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and
 that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors  of thecompany;
 and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  thecompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  anyevaluation
 of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance with the polici
es or procedures may deteriorate.In
 our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September  3, 2017 , based on
 criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  —  Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  TreadwayCommission (2013).
We
 also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  the  consolidatedbalance sheets of the
 Company as of September 3, 2017 and August 28, 2016 , and  the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensiveincome, equity,
 and cash flows for the 53-week period ended September 3, 2017 , and  the 52-week periods ended August 28, 2016 and August 30,2015 
, and our repo rt dated October 17, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion  on those consolidated financial statements./s/ KPMG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data)
Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or
 the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based onthe
 concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandisecategories
 will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At September  3, 2017 ,  Costco operated 741 warehouses worldwide: 514 United States (U.S.) locations (in 
44 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico), 97 Canada locations, 37 Mexico locations, 28 United Kingdom(U.K.) locations, 
26 Japan locations, 13 Korea locations, 13 Taiwan locations, nine Australia locations, two Spain locations, one Iceland location, andone 
France location. The Company operates its e-commerce websites in all countries except Japan, Australia, Spain, Iceland, and France.Basis of Presentation
The
 consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Costco  Wholesale  Corporation,  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  and  subsidiaries  inwhich it
 has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from theCompany’s
 equity.  All  material  inter-company  transactions  between  and  among  the  Company  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  have  beeneliminated
 in  consolidation.  The  Company’s  net  income  excludes  income  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests  in  its  operations  in  Taiwan  andKorea. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributa
ble to Costco.Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 
52/53 week fiscal year  basis with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2017 relate to the 
53 -week fiscal year ended September 3, 2017 .  References to 2016 and 2015 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2016 , and August 30, 2015 
, respectively. Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. general
ly accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to makeestimates and assumptio
ns that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dateof
 the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from thoseestimates and assumptions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The
 Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at thedate
 of  purchase,  and  proceeds  due  from  credit  and  debit  card  transactions  with  settlement  terms  of  up  to  four  days.  Credit  and  debit  cardreceivables were $ 
1,255 and $ 1,071 at the end of 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The
 Company provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end of2017

Short-Term Investments
In
 general, short-term investments have a maturity at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond fiveyears
 may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent theinvestment of cash that
 is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using thespecific
 identification  method  with  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses  reflected  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  until  realized.Realized
 gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded ininterest
 income  and  other,  net  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  Short-term  investments  classified  as  held-to-maturity  are  financialinstruments
 that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasuredto fair value on a recurring basis.
The
 Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment, using both qualitative andquantitative
 criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company recognizes the loss in interest incomeand other, net in the consolidated statements of income.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The
 Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash andcash
 equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2, 3,and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s inv
estments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively.Fair
 value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer  a liability in an orderly transaction  between marketparticipants
 at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observableinputs when measuring fair value. The three leve
ls of inputs are:Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservab
le inputs that are corroborated by marketdata.
Level 3: Significant unobservab
le inputs that are not corroborated by market data.The
 Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such asquoted net asset
 values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all othernon-derivative
 financial  instruments  are  based  on  independent  external  valuation  information.  The  pricing  process  uses  data  from  a  variety  ofindependent
 external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves includingbut not limited to 
treasury benchmarks and Libor and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can bederived
 principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable,using the fair value of the individual sec
urities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred.Current
 financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-termdebt,
 which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs,which are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair valu
e of the Company's long-term debt is based primarilyon reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upo
n interest rates, maturities, and credit.47

Receivables, Net
Receivables
 consist primarily of vendor, reinsurance, credit card incentive, third-party pharmacy and other receivables. Vendor receivables includecoupons,
 volume rebates or other purchase discounts. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due.In
 certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presentedon
 a net basis. Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and primarily represent amountsceded
 through reinsurance arrangements gross of the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities inthe
 consolidated  balance  sheets.  Credit  card  incentive  receivables  primarily  represent  amounts  earned  under  the  co-branded  credit  cardarrangement
 in the U.S. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’ insurance companies. Other receivablesprimarily consist of amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items.
Receivables
 are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on historical experience and application of the specificidentification method. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial for fiscal years 
2017 , 2016 , and 2015 . Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories consist of the followi
ng at the end of 2017 and 2016 :  
2017   2016 United States
$ 7,091  $6,422 Canada
1,040  1,015 Other Inte
rnational1,703  1,532 Merchandise inventories
$ 9,834  $8,969 Merchandise inventories
 are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting, usingthe
 last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matchingcurrent
 costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation ordeflation,
 and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels forthe
 year  have  been  determined.  Canadian  and  Other  International  merchandise  inventories  are  predominantly  valued  using  the  cost  and  retailinventory methods, respectively, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
As
 of September 3, 2017, U.S. merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle.Due
 to net deflation, a benefit of $64 and $27 was recorded to merchandise costs in 2016 ,  and 2015 ,  respectively. At the end of 2017 and 2016,the cumulative impact of the LIFO valuation on merchandise inve
ntories was zero and immaterial, respectively.The
 Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales, using estimates based onthe Company’s experience. The provisio
n is adjusted periodically to reflect actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second andfourth
 fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progressestowards earning those rebates, provided that they are probab
le and reasonably estimable.Property and Equipment
Property and
 equipment are stated at cost. In general, new building additions are classified into components, each with its own estimated useful life,generally 
five to fifty years for buildings and improvements  and three to twenty years  for  equipment  and fixtures.  Depreciation  and amortizationexpense is computed using the

straight-line
 method over estimated useful lives or the lease term, if shorter. Leasehold improvements made after the beginning of the initial leaseterm
 are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that arereasonably assured at the date the leaseho
ld improvements are made.The
 Company  capitalizes  certain  computer  software  and  software  development  costs  incurred  in  developing  or  obtaining  computer  software  forinternal
 use.  These  costs  are  included  in  equipment  and  fixtures  and  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  thesoftware, generally 
three to seven years. Repair
 and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or changethe
 way  an  asset  functions  or  that  extend  the  useful  life  are  capitalized.  Assets  that  were  removed  during  the  remodel,  refurbishment  orimprovement are retired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of 
2017 and 2016 were immaterial. The
 Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes incircumstances
 may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For assetgroups
 held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimatedfuture
 undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In theevent
 that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss would be recognized for the asset group to be held and used equalto
 the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group),the carrying value is
 compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisalsfrom
 third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. There were no impairment charges recognized in 2017 and 2016 ,  and charges wereimmaterial in 
2015 and included in selli ng, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities
The
 Company  is  predominantly  self-insured,  with  insurance  coverage  for  certain  catastrophic  risks,  for  employee  health  care  benefits,  workers’compensation,
 general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. We use different mechanismsincluding
 a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) and participate in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risksthat
 are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors,severity factors,
 and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences andclaims
 differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2017 and 2016 ,  these insurance liabilities were $ 1,059 and $ 1,021 in the aggregate, respectively, and were includ
ed in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classifiedbased on their nature.
The
 captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, inthe
 consolidated  statements  of  income.  The  captive  participates  in  a  reinsurance  program  that  includes  other  third-party  participants.  Thereinsuran
ce agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement ofthe
 next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program limit a participating members’ individual risk. Incomestatement
 adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as informationbecomes
 known.  In  the  event  the  Company  leaves  the  reinsurance  program,  the  Company  is  not  relieved  of  its  primary  obligation  to  thepolicyholders for activity prior to the termination of the annual agreeme
nt.49

Derivatives
The
 Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part,through
 the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on knownfuture
 expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreign-currency.  The  contracts  relate  primarily  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventoryexpenditures
 made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts donot
 qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage inspeculative
 transactions.  These  contracts  do  not  contain  any  credit-risk-related  contingent  features.  The  aggregate  notional  amounts  of  open,unsettled
 forward foreign-exchange contracts were $ 637 and $ 572 at the end of 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively. The Company seeks to managecounterparty
 risk  associated  with these  contracts  by limiting  transactions  to counterparties  with which the  Company has an established  bankingrelationship.
 There can be no assurance that this practice is effective. The contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 3 forinformation on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchan
ge contracts at the end of 2017 and 2016 . The
 unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to thenet changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exch
ange contracts were immaterial in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 . The
 Company  is  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  prices  for  the  energy  it  consumes,  particularly  electricity  and  natural  gas,  which  it  seeks  to  partiallymitigate
 through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Companyalso
 enters  into  variable-priced  contracts  for  some  purchases  of  natural  gas,  in  addition  to  fuel  for  its  gas  stations,  on  an  index  basis.  Thesecontracts
 meet  the  characteristics  of  derivative  instruments,  but  generally  qualify  for  the  “normal  purchases  or  normal  sales”  exception  underauthoritative guidance and requ
ire no mark-to-market adjustment.Foreign Currency
The
 functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assetsand
 liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded inaccumulated
 other  comprehensive  loss.  Revenues  and  expenses  of  the  Company’s  consolidated  foreign  operations  are  translated  at  averageexchange rates pre
vailing during the year.The
 Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominatedin currencies other than the functional currency in interest income an
d other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Generally,these
 include  the  U.S.  dollar  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  the  U.S.  dollar  payables  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  revalued  to  their  functionalcurrency.
 Also included are realized foreign-currency  gains or losses from settlements  of forward foreign-exchange contracts.  These items wereimmaterial fo
r 2017 and resulted in net gains of $38 , and $35 for 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Revenue Recognition
The
 Company  generally  recognizes  sales,  which  include  gross  shipping  fees  where  applicable,  net  of  returns,  at  the  time  the  member  takespossession
 of  merchandise  or  receives  services.  When  the  Company  collects  payments  from  members  prior  to  the  transfer  of  ownership  ofmerchandise
 or the performance of services, the amounts received are generally recorded as deferred sales, included in other current liabilities inthe
 consolidated  balance  sheets,  until  the  sale  or  service  is  completed.  The  Company  reserves  for  estimated  sales  returns  based  on  historicaltrends
 in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The sales returns reserve is based on an estimate of the netrealizable value of merchandise

inventories excepted to be returned. Amounts collected from members for sales or value add
ed taxes are recorded on a net basis.Generally,
 when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, can influenceproduct
 or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not theprimary obligor and does not
 possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, it records the net amounts earned, which is reflected in netsales.
The
 Company  accounts  for  membership  fee  revenue,  net  of  refunds,  on  a  deferred  basis,  ratably  over  the  one-year  membership  period.  TheCompany's
 Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of approximately $ 1,000 per year), which can
 be  redeemed  only  at  Costco  warehouses.  The  Company  accounts  for  this  reward  as  a  reduction  in  sales.  The  sales  reduction  andcorresponding
 liability (classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets) are computed after giving effect to the estimatedimpact
 of non-redemptions, based on historical data. The net reduction in sales was $ 1,281 ,  $ 1,172 ,  and $ 1,128 in 2017 , 2016 ,  and 2015 , respectively.
Merchandise Costs
Merchandise
 costs consist of the purchase price of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company’sdepot
 operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also includesalaries, benefits, depreciation, and utiliti
es in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments.Vendor Consideration
The
 Company  has  agreements  to  receive  funds  from  vendors  for  coupons  and  a  variety  of  other  programs.  These  programs  are  evidenced  bysigned
 agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebateor
 discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reductionof merchandise costs upon completion of contractual mileston
es, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach.Selling, General and Ad
ministrative ExpensesSelling,
 general  and  administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries,  benefits  and  workers’  compensation  costs  for  warehouse  employees(other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary business
es) as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel.Selling,
 general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, credit and debit card processingfees, utilities, and stock-based compensation expe
nse, as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse operations.Retirement Plans
The
 Company's 401(k) Retirement Plan is available to all U.S. employees who have completed 90  days of  employment. The plan allows pre-taxdeferrals, a portion of
 which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution.The
 Company  also  has  a  defined  contribution  plan  for  Canadian  employees  and  contributes  a  percentage  of  each  employee's  salary.  Certainsubsidiaries
 in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit and defined contribution plans that are not material. Amountsexpensed
 under  all  plans  were $543 , $489 ,  and $454 for 2017 , 2016 ,  and 2015 ,  respectively,  and  are  included  in  selling,  general  andadministrative expenses and merchandis
e costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.51

Stock-Based Compensation
Restricted
 stock units (RSUs) granted to employees generally vest over five years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based
 awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. The Company does notreduce
 stock-based  compensation  for  an  estimate  of  forfeitures,  which  are  inconsequential  in  light  of  historical  experience  and  considering  theawards vest on a quarterly basis. Actual forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
Compensation
 expense for all stock-based awards granted is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite serviceperiod
 for the entire award. Awards for employees and non-employee directors provide for accelerated vesting of a portion of outstanding sharesbased
 on cumulative years of service with the Company. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of thelong-service
 term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fairvalue
 of the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurementdate less the present value of the expected divide
nds forgone during the vesting period.Stock-based
 compensation expense is predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements ofincome. Certain stock-bas
ed compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information on theCompany’s stock-ba
sed compensation plans.Leases
The
 Company  leases  land  and/or  buildings  at  warehouses  and  certain  other  office  and  distribution  facilities,  primarily  under  operating  leases.Operating
 leases expire at various dates through 2064 ,  with the exception of one lease in the Company’s U.K. subsidiary, which expires in 2151 . These
 leases  generally  contain  one  or  more  of  the  following  options,  which  the  Company  can  exercise  at  the  end  of  the  initial  lease  term:(a)
 renewal of the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase ofthe property at the then-fair market value; or (c) right of first refusal in the event of a third-party purchase offer.
The
 Company accounts for its lease expense with free rent periods and step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of thelease and
 any extension options that the Company more likely than not expects to exercise, from the date the Company has control of the property.Certain leases provide for periodic rental incre
ases based on price indices, or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume.The
 Company has capital leases for certain warehouse locations, expiring at various dates through 2054 .  Capital lease assets are included in landand
 buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense on capital lease assets is recorded asdepreciation
 expense  and  is  included  in  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses.  Capital  lease  liabilities  are  recorded  at  the  lesser  of  theestimated
 fair market value of the leased property or the net present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments and are included inother
 current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Interest on these obligations is included in interestexpense in the consolidated statements of income.
The Company
 records an asset and related financing obligation for the estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements where itis
 considered  the  owner  for  accounting  purposes,  to  the  extent  the  Company  is  involved  in  the  construction  of  the  building  or  structuralimprovements
 or has construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy, the Company assesses whether these arrangementsqualify
 for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the Company continues to be the deemed owner, it accounts for thearrangement as a financing lease.

The
 Company’s asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that at the end of a lease must be removed. Theseobligations
 are recorded as a liability with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term based upon the estimated fair value of the costs toremove
 the leasehold improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation using the Company’sincremental
 borrowing rate. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the leasehold improvement assets and areincluded
 with buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases were immaterial at the end of 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and are included in other li
abilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.Preopening Expenses
Preopening expenses relate
d to new warehouses, new regional offices and other startup operations are expensed as incurred.Income Taxes
The
 Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future taxconsequences
 attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective taxbases
 and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxableincome
 in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxassets
 and  liabilities  of  a  change  in  tax  rates  is  recognized  in  income  in  the  period  that  includes  the  enactment  date.  A  valuation  allowance  isestablished when necessary to reduce d
eferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.The
 determination  of  the  Company’s  provision  for  income  taxes  requires  significant  judgment,  the  use  of  estimates,  and  the  interpretation  andapplication
 of  complex  tax  laws.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  assessing  the  timing  and  amounts  of  deductible  and  taxable  items  and  theprobability
 of  sustaining  uncertain  tax  positions.  The  benefits  of  uncertain  tax  positions  are  recorded  in  the  Company’s  consolidated  financialstatements
 only  after  determining  a  more-likely-than-not  probability  that  the  uncertain  tax  positions  will  withstand  challenge,  if  any,  from  taxauthorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses thes
e probabilities and records any changes as appropriate. Certain ofthe
 Company's cumulative foreign undistributed earnings were considered by the Company to be indefinitely reinvested as of September  3, 2017 . These
 earnings  would  be  subject  to  U.S.  income  tax  if  the  Company  changed  its  position  and  could  result  in  a  U.S.  tax  liability.  Although  theCompany has historically asserted that cer
tain non-U.S. undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested, it may repatriate such earnings to theextent it can do so without an adverse tax consequence. Se
e Note 8 for additional information.Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco
The
 computation  of  basic  net  income  per  share  uses  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  that  were  outstanding  during  the  period.  Thecomputation
 of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus thenumber
 of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stockmethod for shares subject to RSUs and the “if converted” method for the convertible note securities.
Stock Repurchase Programs
Repurchased
 shares of common stock are retired,  in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchasedshares
 is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital andretained
 earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and isapplied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaini
ng amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information.53

Recent Accounting Pronounceme
nts Not Yet AdoptedIn
 May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers.The
 guidance converges the requirements for reporting revenue and requires disclosures of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenueand
 cash flows arising from these contracts.  Transition is permitted either retrospectively  or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date ofadoption.
 The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Companyplans to adopt this guidance at the begi
nning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2019.The
 Company continues to review current accounting policies, business processes, systems and controls to evaluate the impacts of applying thenew
 standard. Based on its preliminary assessment, the Company believes the new guidance will change recognition timing and classification ofcash
 card breakage income to reflect the historical pattern of gift card redemption rather than the current methodology of recognizing income whenredemption
 is  considered  remote.  The  Company  will  also  present  estimated  sales  returns  on  a  gross  basis  rather  than  net  of  the  sales  returnreserve
 on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company continues to evaluate various areas such as gross versus net revenue presentation forcertain
 contracts,  identification  and  treatment  of  performance  obligations  associated  with  membership  offers,  and  accounting  for  warrantyarrangements
 on qualified purchases. Management continues to evaluate potential impacts on the contracts associated with the co-branded creditcard arrangement as well as its adoption methodol
ogy.In
 February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on leases, which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet forthe
 rights and obligations created by all leases with terms greater than twelve months. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periodswithin those years beginning after December 15,
 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning ofits first quarter
 of fiscal year 2020. While the Company continues to evaluate this standard and the effect on related disclosures, the primary effect ofadoption
 will be to require recording right-of-use assets and corresponding lease obligations for current operating leases. The adoption is expectedto
 have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  consolidated  balance  sheets,  but  not  on  the  consolidated  statements  of  income  or  consolidatedstatements of cash flows 
. In
 March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on stock compensation, intended to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions. Theguidance
 makes several modifications related to the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.The
 new  standard  is  effective  for  fiscal  years  and  interim  periods  within  those  years  beginning  after  December  15,  2016,  with  early  adoptionpermitted.
 The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Adoption of this guidance will likely bematerial to
 the provision for income taxes and earnings per share amounts on the Company’s consolidated income statements for the change in therecognition
 of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. Due to the Company's annual vesting and release of shares in its first fiscal quarter, this maycreate
 increased volatility in these amounts during that quarter of each fiscal year. Previously these amounts were reflected in equity. Additionally,these
 amounts will be reflected as cash flows from operations instead of cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cashflows.
 Adoption of this guidance is not  expected to have a material impact on the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of cashflows, or related disclosures.

During
 and at the end of both 2017 and 2016 ,  the Company did not hold any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair valueon a recurring basis. There were no transfers in or out of Level 1 or 2 during 
2017 and 2016 . Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Val
ue on a Nonrecurring BasisFinancial
 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include held-to-maturity investments that are carried at amortized cost and are notremeasured to
 fair value on a recurring basis. There were no fair value adjustments to these financial assets during 2017 and 2016 .  See Note 4 forthe fair value of long-term debt.
Nonfinancial
 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as long-lived assets that are measured at fair value resultingfrom an impairment, if deemed necessary. There were no fair value adjustments to nonfinanc
ial assets during 2017 and 2016 . Note 4—Debt
Short-Term Borrowings
The
 Company enters into various short-term bank credit facilities, which increased to $833 in 2017 from $429 in 2016 due  to the addition of a $400 revolving
 line of credit in the U.S. which expires June 2018. At the end of 2017 and 2016 ,  there were no outstanding borrowings under these creditfacilities.
In 
2017 ,  short  term  borrowings  were  immaterial.  In 2016 ,  the  average  and  maximum  short  term  borrowings  in  Japan  were $99 and $110 , respectively, and had a weighted avera
ge interest rate of 0.52% during the year. All other short term borrowings during the year were immaterial. 56

Note 4—Debt (Continued)
Long-Term Debt
The
 Company's  long-term  debt  consists  primarily  of  Senior  Notes  that  have  various  principal  balances,  interest  rates,  and  maturity  dates  asdescribed
 below. In May 2017, the Company issued $3,800 in  aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, with maturity dates between May 2021and
 May 2027. In February 2015 and December 2012, the Company issued $1,000 and $3,500 in  aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes,respectively.
In
  June 2017 ,  the Company paid the outstanding $1,100 principal  balance and accrued interest on the 1.125% Senior Notes through proceedsfrom
 the  Senior  Notes  issued  in  May  2017  and  existing  sources  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments.  In  March  2017,  theCompany
 paid the outstanding $1,100 principal  balance and interest on the 5.5% Senior Notes with existing sources of cash and cash equivalentsand short-term investments.
The
 Company,  at  its  option,  may  redeem  the  Senior  Notes  at  any  time,  in  whole  or  in  part,  at  a  redemption  price  plus  accrued  interest.  Theredemption
 price is equal to the greater of 100% of  the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments ofprincipal
 and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, as defined by the terms of the Senior Notes, the holder has the right to requirethe
 Company to purchase this security at a price of 101% of  the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the event. Intereston all outstanding long-term debt is payab
le semi-annually.The
 estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs. Other long-term debt consists primarily of promissory notes and term loansissued
 by the Company's Japanese subsidiary and are valued primarily using Level 3 inputs. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt a

Note 6—Stockholders’ Equity
Dividends
The
 Company’s current quarterly dividend rate is $0.50 per  share. In May 2017 and February 2015, the Company paid special cash dividends of$7.00 
and $5.00 per share, respectively. The aggregate payment was approximate ly $3,100 and $2,201 , respectively. Stock Repurchase Programs
The Company’s
 stock repurchase program is conducted under a $4,000 authorizat ion by the Board of Directors, approved on April 17, 2015 , which expires 
April  17,  2019 .  This  authorization  revoked  previously  authorized  but  unused  amounts,  totaling   $2,528 .  As  of  the  end  of 2017 ,  theremaining
 amount  available  for  stock  repurchases  under  the  approved  plan  was $2,749 .  The following table summarizes  the Company’s  stockrepurchase activity:

Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation Plans
The
 Company  grants  stock-based  compensation  primarily  to  employees  and  non-employee  directors.  Since  2009,  RSU  grants  to  all  executiveofficers
 have  been  performance-based.  Through  a  series  of  shareholder  approvals,  there  have  been  amended  and  restated  plans  and  newprovisions
 implemented by the Company. RSUs held by employees and non-employee directors are subject to quarterly vesting upon retirement orvoluntary
 termination. Employees who attain certain years of service with the Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on theannual
 vesting date rather than upon retirement. The Seventh Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Seventh Plan), amended in the second quarterof
 fiscal 2015, is the Company’s only stock-based compensation plan with shares available for grant at the end of 2017 .  Each share issued inrespect
 of stock awards is counted as 1.75 shares  toward the limit of shares made available under the Seventh Plan. The Seventh Plan authorizedthe
 issuance of 23,500,000 shares  ( 13,429,000 RSUs)  of common stock for future grants in addition to the shares authorized under the previousplan.
 The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participantsannually, net of shares equal to the minimum statutory withholdi
ng taxes.As
 required by the Company's Seventh Plan, in conjunction with the 2017 special cash dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUswas
 increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. The outstanding RSUs were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstandingshares
 by a factor of  1.032 ,  representing the ratio of the NASDAQ closing price of  $180.20  on  May 5, 2017, which was the last trading dayimmediately
 prior to the ex-dividend date, to the NASDAQ opening price of  $174.66 on  the ex-dividend date, May 8, 2017. The outstanding RSUsincreased
 by approximately 247,000 and  this adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of theawards
 did  not  change.  As  further  required  by  the  Seventh  Plan,  the  maximum  number  of  shares  issuable  under  the  Seventh  Plan  wasproportionally adjusted, which resu
lted in an additional 364,000 RSU shares available to be granted. 59

 2015, the Company repatriated a portion of the earnings in the Canadian operations that, in 2014, the Company determined were no longerconsidered
 indefinitely  reinvested.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  the  Company  changed  its  position  regarding  an  additional  portion  of  theundistributed
 earnings of the Canadian operations, which are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. These earnings were distributed in 2016.Current
 exchange  rates  compared  to  historical  rates  when  these  earnings  were  generated  resulted  in  an  immaterial  U.S.  benefit,  which  wasrecorded
 at the end of 2015. During 2017, the Company changed its position regarding an additional portion of the undistributed earnings of itsCanadian
 operations  as  they  could  be  repatriated  without  adverse  tax  consequences.  Accordingly,  that  portion  is  no  longer  considered  to  beindefinitely
 reinvested.  Subsequent  to  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  the  Company  repatriated  a  portion  of  undistributed  earnings  in  its  Canadianoperations without adverse tax conseque
nces.The
 Company has not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of $3,176 and $3,280 at  the end of 2017 and 2016 , respectively,
 of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries because the earnings have not been repatriated, or subsidiaries have invested or willinvest
 the  undistributed  earnings  indefinitely,  or  the  earnings,  if  repatriated  would  not  result  in  an  adverse  tax  consequence.  Because  of  theavailability
 of U.S. foreign tax credits and complexity of the computation, it is not practicable to determine at this time the U.S. federal income taxliability
 that would be associated with such earnings if such earnings were not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. Deferred taxes are recorded forearnings of foreign operations when it is determin
ed that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested.The
 Company believes that its U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet its U.S. liquidity requirements and has no current plansto
 repatriate for use in the U.S. the cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by these non-U.S. subsidiaries whose earnings areconsidered indefinitely 
reinvested.62

des tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timingof
 such deductibility. At the end of 2017 and 2016 ,  these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other thaninterest
 and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment ofcash
 to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income taxrate in future periods is 
$29 and $46 at the end of 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Accrued
 interest  and  penalties  related  to  income  tax  matters  are  classified  as  a  component  of  income  tax  expense.  Interest  and  penaltiesrecognized by the Company were not material in 
2017 or 2016 . Accrued interest and penalties were not material at the end of 2017 or 2016 . The
 Company  is  currently  under  audit  by  several  taxing  jurisdictions  in  the  United  States  and  in  several  foreign  countries.  Some  audits  mayconclude
 in the next 12 months and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It isnot
 practical to estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions inconnection
 with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognizedtax benefits in the next 12 months.
The
 Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada and in several other foreign jurisdictions.With
 few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2014. The Company iscurrently
 subject to examination in Canada for fiscal years 2013 to present and in California for fiscal years 2007 to present. No other examinationsare believed to be material.

 matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish anaccrual,
 but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. Ineach
 case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where noaccrual
 has  been  recorded,  the  possible  loss  or  range  of  loss  (including  any  loss  in  excess  of  the  accrual)  cannot,  in  the  Company's  view,  bereasonably estimated because, among other things:
 (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factualtheories are not well developed; an
d/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties.The Company is a defendant in the follow
ing matters, among others:Numerous putative class
 actions have been brought around the United States against motor fuel retailers, including the Company, alleging that theyhave
 been overcharging consumers by selling gasoline or diesel that is warmer than 60 degrees without adjusting the volume sold to compensatefor heat-related expansion or disclosing the effect
 of such expansion on the energy equivalent received by the consumer. The Company is named inthe

 12, 2009, the Company agreed to settle the actions in which it is named as a defendant. Under the settlement, the Company agreed, to theextent
 allowed by law and subject to other terms and conditions in the agreement, to install over five years from the effective date of the settlementtemperature-correcting
 dispensers in the States of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina,South

 class members. On September 22, 2011, the court preliminarily approved a revised settlement, which did not materially alter the terms.On
 April 24, 2012, the court granted final approval of the revised settlement. Plaintiffs moved for an award of $10 in attorneys’ fees, as well as anaward of costs and payme
nts to class representatives. A report and recommendation was issued in favor of a fee award of $4 . On August 24, 2016,the district court af
firmed the report and recommendation. On March 20, 2014, the Company filed a notice invoking a “most favored nation” provisionunder
 the  settlement,  under  which  it  sought  to  adopt  provisions  in  later  settlements  with  certain  other  defendants.  The  motion  was  denied  onJanuary 23, 2015. Final judgment was entere

 The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company has filed an answerdenying the material allegatio
ns of the complaint.The
 Company received notices from most states stating that they have appointed an agent to conduct an examination of the books and records ofthe
 Company to determine whether it has complied with state unclaimed property laws. In addition to seeking the turnover of unclaimed propertysubject
 to escheat laws, the states may seek interest, penalties, costs of examinations, and other relief. The agent appears to have concluded itsexamination,
 without  seeking  payments  from  the  Company.  Certain  states  have  separately  also  made  requests  for  payment  by  the  Companyconcerning a specific type of property, some of which have been p
aid in immaterial amounts.The
 Company received from the Drug Enforcement Administration subpoenas and administrative inspection warrants concerning the Company'sfulfillment
 of prescriptions related to controlled substances and related practices. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into a settlementagreement in January 2017 under whic
h it paid $12 to the Department of Justice, an amount for which a previous accrual was made.On

 and information concerning compliance with the anti-rebate provisions in the Ontario Drug Benefit Act and the Drug Interchangeabilityand Dispensing Fee Act. The Company is se
eking to cooperate with the request.In

 regarding hazardous waste practices at its Connecticut warehouses, primarily concerning unsalable pharmaceuticals. The Company isseeking to cooperate concerning the resol
ution of these notices.The

on; however, it is possible65
