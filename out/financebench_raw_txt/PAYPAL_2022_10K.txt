ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies
commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services to help improve the
financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around the world. Our goal is to enable our
merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world in the markets we serve, anytime, on any platform, and using any device
when sending payments or getting paid, including person-to-person (“P2P”) payments. Our core values of Inclusion, Innovation, Collaboration, and Wellness,
reflected in our leadership principles, are the driving forces behind our mission and form the foundation of our operating philosophy. We believe that our core
values help stimulate the creativity and engagement of our global workforce to deliver products and services designed to meet the diverse needs of our
customers. We also believe that effective management of environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) risks and opportunities is essential to deliver on our
mission and strategy. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “PayPal” refer to
PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Table of Contents
PayPal’s payment solutions enable our customers to connect, transact, and send and receive payments, whether they are online or in person. We provide
proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants that enable the completion of payments on our platform on behalf of our customers. We operate a global,
two-sided network at scale that connects merchants and consumers with 435 million active accounts (consisting of 400 million consumer active accounts and
35 million merchant active accounts) across more than 200 markets as of December 31, 2022.
We offer our customers the flexibility to use their PayPal or Venmo accounts to purchase and receive payments for goods and services, as well as the ability to
transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a
bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, PayPal and Venmo branded credit products including our installment products, a credit card, a debit card,
certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible rewards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and
simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement
capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage
risk. We help reduce the friction typically involved in cross-border commerce by offering consumers a simple payment experience and by enabling merchants
to extend their reach to consumers in the global markets in which our services are available.
We earn revenues primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for our customers and other payment-related services, which are typically
based on the volume of activity processed on our payments platform. We also generate revenue from customers on fees charged for foreign currency
conversion, for instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, and to facilitate the purchase and sale of
cryptocurrencies; however, we generally do not charge customers to fund or draw from their accounts. We also earn revenue by providing other value added
services, which are comprised primarily of revenue earned through partnerships, interest and fees from our merchant and consumer credit products, interest
earned on certain assets underlying customer balances, referral fees, subscription fees, and gateway services.

KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS
We measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers through certain metrics, including total payment volume,
payment transactions, and active accounts:
Total payment volume (“TPV”) is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via
a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.
Number of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by
PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.
An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including
gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s platform
or services through such third-party’s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout capabilities. A user may register on
our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active
account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct
relationship to our operating results.
OUR STRENGTHS
Our business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive growth and differentiate us from our competitors. A critical element of our overall growth
strategy involves increasing the engagement of our active accounts, which we expect will contribute to growth in payment transactions, total payment volume,
and net revenues. We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:
•Two-sided network—our payments platform connecting merchants and consumers enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product experiences
while gaining valuable insights into how our customers use our platform. Our payments platform provides for digital and in-store (at the point of sale)
transactions while being both technology and platform agnostic.
•Merchant and consumer choice—our branded and unbranded card processing payment solutions support an open ecosystem that provides choice to
both merchants and consumers, enabling flexibility to make and receive payments using a wide variety of different funding options and digital wallet
solutions.

Table of Contents
•Scale—our global scale helps us to drive organic growth. As of December 31, 2022, we had 435 million active accounts, consisting of 400 million
consumer active accounts and 35 million merchant active accounts in more than 200 markets around the world. A market is a geographic area or
political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in which we offer some or all of our products and services. A country, territory, or
protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations. In 2022, we processed $1.36 trillion of TPV.
•Trusted brands—we have built and strengthened well-recognized and trusted brands, including PayPal, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, Hyperwallet, PayPal
Zettle, PayPal Honey, and Paidy. Our communications and marketing efforts across multiple geographies and demographic groups play an important
role in building brand visibility, usage, and overall preference among customers.
•Risk and compliance management—our enterprise risk and compliance management program is designed to help secure customer information and to
help ensure we process legitimate transactions around the world, while identifying and minimizing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.
•Regulatory licenses—we believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct advantage and
help support business growth.
MERCHANT AND CONSUMER PAYMENT SOLUTIONS
During 2022, we reorganized our product organization to better align with merchants and consumers to help simplify decision making and enable our teams to
innovate and launch new products and features more quickly and efficiently.
Merchant value proposition
We partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses by providing global reach and powering all aspects of digital checkout. We offer
alternative payment methods (including access to credit solutions), provide fraud prevention and risk management solutions, reduce merchant losses through
proprietary protection programs, and offer tools and insights for utilizing data analytics to attract and engage customers and improve sales conversion. We
employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to quickly and easily provide digital checkout online, including
through PayPal-branded checkout and unbranded card processing (primarily consisting of Braintree), as well as in-store at the point of sale, across all platforms
and devices, and to securely and simply receive payments from their customers.

Table of Contents
PayPal’s payments platform enables merchants to accept all types of online and offline payments, including those made with the PayPal and Venmo digital
wallets, our consumer credit products, credit cards and debit cards, and competing digital wallets, as well as other popular local payment methods. Our
diversified suite of products and services is tailored to meet the needs of merchants regardless of their size or business complexity. We have expanded our
merchant value proposition to enable payment acceptance at the point of sale through our PayPal and Venmo digital wallets and our PayPal Zettle point of sale
solutions. We aim to offer a seamless, omni-channel solution that helps merchants manage and grow their business. Through our consumer-focused offerings,
we provide simplified and personalized shopping experiences for consumers, including easier exchanges and returns, to help merchants drive increased
conversion through higher consumer engagement.
We offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses through the PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan
products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant finance offerings. The PayPal Working Capital product allows businesses to access a loan or cash
advance for a fixed fee and based on their annual payment volume processed by PayPal. The PayPal Business Loan product provides businesses with short-
term financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner. In the United States (“U.S.”), these products
are provided under a program agreement with an independent chartered financial institution. We believe that our merchant finance offerings enable us to
deepen our engagement with our existing small and medium-sized merchants and expand services to new merchants by providing access to capital that may not
be available from traditional banks or other lending providers.
We generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other payment-related services. We also earn
revenues from interest and fees earned on our merchant loans receivables.
Consumer value proposition
We focus on providing affordable, convenient, and secure consumer financial products and services intended to democratize the management and movement of
money. We provide consumers with a digital wallet that enables them to send payments to merchants more safely using a variety of funding sources, which
may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, our consumer credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other
stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible rewards. Our goal is to create the simplest checkout experience possible for consumers both online and on
mobile devices.
We also offer consumers P2P payment solutions through our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products and services. We enable both domestic and international P2P
transfers across our payments platform. Our Venmo digital wallet in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers and to
make purchases at select merchants. Our Xoom international money transfer service enables our customers to send money to people around the world in a
secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is an important source of customer engagement and also serves as a customer acquisition channel that facilitates
organic growth by enabling potential users to establish active accounts with PayPal or Venmo at the time they make or receive a P2P payment. We also focus
on simplifying and personalizing shopping experiences for our consumers by offering tools for product discovery, price tracking, offers, convenient tracking
and redemption options for their shopping rewards, and easier exchanges and returns, which help our merchants to increase consumer engagement and sales
conversion.
We offer credit products to consumers in certain markets as a funding source at checkout, subject to approval of credit for the account holder. Our consumer
credit offerings include our buy now, pay later products in the U.S., United Kingdom (“U.K.”), France, and Germany, among others, and in Japan through
Paidy. A key attribute of our buy now, pay later products is the absence of interest or consumer late fees for missed payments in most of the geographies where
we offer them. Further, we offer consumer interest-bearing installment products for consumers in the U.S., issued by an independent chartered financial
institution, and in Germany. In the U.S., consumers may apply for our PayPal- and Venmo-branded consumer credit cards and our PayPal Credit revolving
consumer credit product, which are offered through a partnership with an independent chartered financial institution. We offer a PayPal-issued PayPal Credit
product in the U.K. We believe that our consumer credit products help enable us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided
network.
We have expanded our consumer value proposition through enhancements to the PayPal and Venmo digital wallets, which provide functionality to enable
consumers to more easily checkout, explore deals and offers, track and redeem rewards, and to transact with cryptocurrencies, including buying, holding,
selling, sending, and receiving them in certain markets. Our goal is to drive increased consumer engagement by providing consumers with a comprehensive set
of services to manage their finances and enhance their ability to shop online and in person.

Table of Contents
We generate revenue from consumers on: fees charged for foreign currency conversion, instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank
account or debit card, and to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; interest, fees, or other revenue from our credit products; and other
miscellaneous fees.
PROTECTING MERCHANTS AND CONSUMERS
Protecting merchants and consumers on our payments platform from financial and fraud loss is important to successfully competing and sustainably growing
our business. Fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft (including stolen financial information), and malicious activities by counterparties,
represent a significant risk to merchants and consumers, as well as their payment partners. We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for
certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. We believe that these programs, which help protect both merchants and consumers from
financial loss resulting from fraud and counterparty non-performance, are generally consistent with or broader than protections provided by other participants
in the payments industry. Our protection programs are designed to promote confidence on both the part of consumers, who will only be required to pay in
certain circumstances, such as receiving their purchased item in the condition significantly as described, and merchants, who will receive payment for
delivering an item to the customer.
Our ability to help protect both merchants and consumers is based largely on our proprietary, end-to-end payments platform and our ability to utilize the data
from both sides of transactions on our two-sided network, specifically from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments. Our ongoing
investment in systems and processes is designed to enhance the safety and security of our products and reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of
the world’s most trusted payments brands.
COMPETITION
The global payments industry is highly competitive, dynamic, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Many of the
areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of merchants and
consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses enter into business
combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.
We compete with a wide range of businesses. Some of our current and potential competitors are or may be larger than we are, have larger customer bases,
greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, a dominant or more secure position, broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share
than we do, or offer products and services that we do not offer. Other competitors are or may be smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in
responding to regulatory and technological changes and customer preferences.
We differentiate ourselves to merchants through our ability to innovate and develop products and services that offer new payment experiences for our
merchants, demonstrate that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers, support transactions on our payments
platform across varied technologies and payment methods, through the simplicity and transparency of our fee structure, our seller protection programs,
analytics, and risk management, as well as other merchant services. In addition, we differentiate ourselves to consumers through the ability to use our products
and services across multiple commerce channels, including e-commerce, mobile, and payments at the point of sale, and without sharing their financial
information with the merchant or any other party they are paying; our customer service, dispute resolution, and purchase protection programs; and our ability to
simplify and personalize shopping experiences. We invest resources towards improving our products and services, offering choice in payment options,
providing excellent customer service, and building brands that merchants and consumers trust.

Table of Contents
Our business faces competition from a wide range of businesses and from all forms of physical and electronic payments. We face competition from banks and
financial institutions, which provide traditional payment methods (particularly credit cards and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), electronic bank
transfers, and credit), payment networks that facilitate payments for payment cards or proprietary retail networks, payment card processors, and “card on file”
services. We also face competition from providers offering a variety of payment products and services, including tokenized and contactless payment cards,
digital wallets and mobile payments solutions, credit, installment or other buy now pay later methods, real-time payment systems, P2P payments and money
remittance services, card readers and other devices or technologies for payment at point of sale, virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies, and tools
that simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers and merchants. Our products and services face competition from all forms of payments,
which include paper-based payments (primarily cash and checks), credit cards, debit cards, electronic bank transfers, account-to-account payments, credit,
installment methods, digital wallets and mobile payment solutions, contactless payments (including contactless cards, tokenized cards, Near Field
Communication (NFC) based solutions, and Quick Response (QR) code-based solutions), and virtual currencies, such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.
In addition to the discussion in this section, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide
in the global payments industry” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business.
STRATEGY
Our ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things, the macroeconomic environment and its impact on consumer spending patterns, merchant and
consumer adoption of digital payment methods, the expansion of multiple commerce channels, the growth of mobile devices and merchant and consumer
applications on those devices, the growth of consumers globally with internet and mobile access, the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital forms of
payment, our share of the digital payments market, and our ability to innovate and introduce new products, services, and features that merchants and consumers
value. Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:
•Growing our core business: through expanding our global capabilities, customer base and scale, increasing our customers’ engagement and use of our
products and services by better addressing their everyday needs to access, manage, and move money, creating seamless checkout experiences, and
expanding the adoption of our solutions by merchants and consumers;
•Expanding our value proposition for merchants and consumers: by being technology and platform agnostic, partnering with our merchants to grow and
expand their business online and in-store, and providing consumers with simple, secure, and flexible ways to manage and move money across different
markets, merchants, and platforms, and simplifying their shopping experiences;
•Forming and expanding strategic partnerships: by building new strategic partnerships and deepening existing ones to provide better experiences for our
customers, offer greater choice and flexibility, acquire new customers, and reinforce our role in the payments ecosystem; and
•Seeking new areas of growth: organically and through acquisitions and strategic investments in our existing and new international markets and focusing on
innovation in both the digital and physical world.
ESG MANAGEMENT
PayPal is committed to creating a more inclusive global economy and advancing our core values of Inclusion, Innovation, Collaboration, and Wellness across
our communities, workforce, and strategies. We manage priority ESG risks and opportunities organized across four key pillars: (1) employees and culture, (2)
social innovation, (3) environmental sustainability, and (4) responsible business practices. We believe this integrated, enterprise-wide approach to managing our
global business responsibly helps to enable us to create value for all our stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, partners, and communities. We
continue to advance and prioritize efforts to manage key non-financial factors critical to our long-term business, including progress on our science-based
approach to reducing our climate change impacts, targeted investments and partnerships to address the racial wealth gap and empower underserved
communities and businesses, ongoing programmatic development intended to foster an inclusive culture across the employee experience, and further
enhancements to support the safety and security of our products and platform. We take this commitment seriously and endeavor to provide transparent
disclosures on our progress through our annual Global Impact Report and other communications.

TECHNOLOGY
Our payments platform utilizes a combination of proprietary and third-party technologies and services intended to facilitate transactions efficiently and securely
between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different channels, markets, and networks. Our payments platform connects with financial
service providers around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is
located. Consumers who use our payments platform can send payments in more than 200 markets around the world and in nearly 150 currencies, withdraw
funds to their bank accounts in 56 currencies, and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 25 currencies.
We have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools, transaction management databases, and payment network integrations on our platform designed to
enable our customers to utilize our suite of products and services. Our payments platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are
designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer robust solutions to our global ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time
helping to maintain the security of our customers’ information.
The technology infrastructure supporting our payments platform is designed to simplify the storage and processing of large amounts of data and facilitate the
deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services in both our own data centers and when hosted by third-party cloud service providers. Our
technology infrastructure is designed around industry best practices intended to reduce downtime and help ensure the resiliency of our payments platform in the
event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our payments platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for business continuity and system redundancy
purposes and to help mitigate cybersecurity risks. We have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect our technology infrastructure and
payments platform against cybersecurity threats, which includes regularly testing our systems to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We strive to
continually improve our technology infrastructure and payments platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability, and
security.
For additional information regarding risks relating to our technology infrastructure and cybersecurity, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the
captions “Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition” and “Business
interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business.”
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our total research and development expense was $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.4 billion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, patents, and trade secrets, is important to the
success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws, regulations, and administrative procedures in the U.S.
and internationally. We have registered our core brands as domain names and as trademarks in the U.S. and many international jurisdictions. We also have an
active program to secure and enforce trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. We have filed and continue to file
patent applications in the U.S. and in international jurisdictions covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology and new innovations. We also rely on
contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services. We routinely enter into confidentiality and invention
assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to,
and use and disclosure of, our proprietary information.
For additional information regarding risks relating to our intellectual property, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “Third parties
may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights” and “We may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property.”

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments
industry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable
to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation.
New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions
related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely
and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.
Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in the markets we
operate, which are subject to interpretation and change.
Payments regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned
subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of
Columbia and certain territories. These licenses include not only the PayPal-branded products and services offered in these locations, but also our Venmo,
Hyperwallet, and Xoom products and services to the extent offered in these locations. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to, among other
requirements, restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory
agencies. In certain cases, these licenses also generally cover PayPal’s service enabling customers to buy, hold, transfer, and sell cryptocurrency directly from
their PayPal or Venmo account. In the State of New York, PayPal holds a full Bitlicense issued by the New York Department of Financial Services to offer
cryptocurrency services in the state.
Outside the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those
non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory authorities,
the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), the Australian Prudential
Regulation Authority, the People’s Bank of China, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Bank of Russia, and the
Central Bank of Brazil have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions. This list is not exhaustive, and there are
numerous other regulatory agencies which have asserted or may assert jurisdiction over our activities.
In addition, financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the European Union (“EU”), have implemented authentication
requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, make it more difficult for new customers
to open PayPal accounts, and reduce the ease of use of our products.
Banking agency supervision. We serve our customers in the EU and U.K. through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. (“PayPal (Europe)”), a wholly-owned
subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg by the CSSF. Under the U.K.’s Temporary Permissions Regime,
PayPal is deemed to be authorized and regulated by the U.K. FCA as a result of Brexit. Consequently, we must comply with rules and regulations of the
European banking industry, including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, anti-money laundering, disclosure, reporting,
and inspection. We are, or may be, subject to banking-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry. In
addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and examination by the regulators of
these partner financial institutions.
Lending regulation. Our U.S. consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt
collection. PayPal holds multiple state licenses as the lender of this product. Paidy, Inc. holds multiple licenses for the issuance of its consumer installment
products in Japan and is registered with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry as a Comprehensive Credit Purchase Intermediary. In Australia, PayPal
Credit Pty Limited offers a consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product that is exempt from regulation by the primary consumer credit legislation,
but is subject to other laws which cover the provision of financial services, credit reporting, debt collection, and privacy. PayPal’s consumer short-term,
interest-free, installment products in the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, and Italy are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation; however,
certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection, and banking transparency regulations apply to this activity.

Our U.S. consumer interest-bearing installment product is subject to federal and state laws and is offered by an independent chartered financial institution.
PayPal’s interest-bearing installment product for consumers in Germany is subject to applicable local laws such as consumer (lending) laws, consumer
protection, or banking transparency regulations. These loans are originated by PayPal (Europe).
PayPal and Venmo co-branded consumer credit cards and the PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product are issued by an independent chartered financial
institution in the U.S., and are subject to laws and regulations governing these programs. PayPal Credit in the U.K. is a regulated, revolving consumer credit
product subject to applicable local laws and regulations.
Our U.S. merchant lending products are subject to federal and state regulations and are offered by an independent chartered financial institution. Our merchant
lending products offered in Germany, France and the Netherlands are subject to the laws of Luxembourg and certain local laws, and our merchant lending
product offered in the U.K. is subject to U.K. regulation. The loans offered to European and U.K. merchants are originated by PayPal (Europe). Our merchant
lending product in Australia is subject to the laws of Australia and originated by PayPal Credit Pty Limited.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The CFPB has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the U.S., including
consumer credit, deposits, payments, and similar products. As a large market participant of remittance transfers, the CFPB has direct supervisory authority over
our business. The CFPB and similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the
promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business.
Anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and sanctions. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations in the U.S. and
other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent
our payments platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with
persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and
equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, are composed of
policies, procedures, and internal controls, and are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and
terrorist financing risks.
Interchange fees. Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. For example, in the
EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee Regulation caps interchange fees for credit and debit card payments and provides for business rules to be complied with
by any company dealing with payment card transactions, including PayPal. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject
of regulatory challenge.
Data protection and privacy. We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations (“privacy and data protection laws”) relating to the
collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (collectively, “processing”) of personally identifiable information about our customers, our
merchants’ customers, and employees (“personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of personal data in many
jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial
information associated with individuals, is subject to one or more privacy and data protection laws in one or more jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply
not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have
commercial relationships.
Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. Regulatory
authorities are continuously considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain additional privacy and data
protection obligations. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, or amending data privacy legislation or
regulation aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in
the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are subject to change and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs.
Anti-corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws
in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide
anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair
business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with
these laws and regulations.

Additional regulatory developments. Various regulatory agencies continue to examine and implement laws governing a wide variety of issues, including virtual
currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, competition, and marketing, which may impact PayPal’s business.
Certain governments around the world are adopting laws and regulations pertaining to ESG performance, transparency, and reporting, including those related to
general corporate ESG disclosures (e.g., the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) as well as topical reporting and risk management requirements,
such as obligations related to the management of climate-related risks.

HUMAN CAPITAL
At PayPal, we consider the management of our global talent (human capital) to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. As of December 31, 2022,
we employed approximately 29,900 people globally, with 44% in the Americas, 43% in Asia-Pacific, and 13% in Europe and the Middle East. Our global
employees work predominantly full-time and represent nearly 150 nationalities, across 27 countries, including approximately 11,800 located in the U.S.
Attracting, recruiting, developing, and retaining diverse talent enables us to provide our customers with products and services that help them to thrive in the
global economy, and serve our other stakeholders. In 2022, we developed 12 leadership principles based on our four core values that establish a common set of
expectations for all employees. We began integrating these principles across our global talent strategy to help shape our programs throughout the employee
lifecycle and achieve key business priorities. We also remain focused on promoting the physical, mental, and financial wellness of our employees, particularly
as our workforce continues to navigate changes in where and how we work.

Table of Contents
Employee engagement
We use employee feedback to directly inform the ongoing development of our employee programs. In addition to administering an annual survey to gather
input from our global workforce, we also conducted specific surveys to gather direct employee feedback on our internal communications approach and
evolving workplace preferences. For our 2022 annual employee survey, we heard from 83% of our global employees. Our engagement score, which reflects
employees that would recommend PayPal to their peers and/or are happy at PayPal was 79%. Our score measuring intent to stay was 78%, which reflects an
employee’s expectation to remain employed with the company in two years. Additionally, we observed improvements in employee scores regarding
collaboration and manager support. In 2022, we enhanced our survey to incorporate viewpoints on the employee experience, diversity, inclusion, equity, and
belonging (“DIE&B”) efforts, and our leadership principles, including specific questions on working style and strategic direction. The detailed scores are
shared across the organization and analyzed to understand differences by geography, demographics, business function, and job level, and to help identify
opportunities for further improvement.
Talent acquisition, development, and retention
As a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences, we compete for top global talent around the world. We
believe that a strong culture focused on employee experiences that enables advancement, learning, and individual career insights is essential to the successful
acquisition, development, and retention of diverse talent. Accordingly, we have implemented programs focused on inclusive hiring practices and extending our
talent pipeline through targeted partnerships, reimagined our career development program for individuals and managers, extended individual coaching and
mentorship programs (particularly for underrepresented and technical talent), and advanced efforts for employees to grow through self-paced and community
learning experiences.
Employee wellness
We remain focused on promoting the holistic well-being of our employees, including resources, programs, and services to support our employees’ physical,
mental, and financial wellness. In 2022, our initiatives included extending our Global Wellness Days for all employees to take time to rest and recharge,
providing resources, trainings, and workshops to foster emotional well-being, preserving workplace flexibility through Crisis Leave and other programs, and
strategically extending employee benefits to additional global markets. We also continued our efforts to strengthen employee financial wellness, including
offering individual employee financial coaching, promoting the prioritization of employee financial health across the private sector through the Worker
Financial Wellness Initiative, and improving our internal measurement and evaluation approaches to identify targeted opportunities for further enhancements.
Through our global community impact program, we support our employees’ individual passions and communities by matching eligible employee donations and
volunteer time with non-profit organizations up to $2,500 annually per employee.
Diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging
We believe that fostering DIE&B is critical to our global talent strategy and pivotal to building a culture that embraces individual characteristics, values
diversity, minimizes barriers, and enhances feelings of security and support across the workplace. We are committed to equal pay for equal work, promoting
enterprise-wide inclusive learning opportunities, and partnering with leading organizations to embed DIE&B considerations into our talent strategy. We believe
that our strong commitment to DIE&B is evident at all levels of the organization from our Board of Directors to our executive leadership team to our global
workforce. As of December 31, 2022, 50% of our Board and 64% of our senior leadership team identified as women and/or from a diverse ethnic group. Across
our workforce, we reached 56% overall diverse workforce representation, including 44% global gender diversity (inclusive of self-identified women and non-
binary employees), and 54% U.S. ethnic diversity, as of December 31, 2022. Additional U.S. workforce diversity metrics can be found in our public EEO-1
reports and annual Global Impact Report available at https://about.pypl.com/values-in-action/reporting/default.aspx.

Table of Contents
Workforce representation is only one aspect of our broader DIE&B strategy. Through the leadership of our Global Head of DIE&B and dedicated DIE&B
team, along with functional collaboration and accountability, we are focused on strengthening existing efforts and piloting new initiatives to promote an
inclusive culture. In 2022, we continued our support for underrepresented communities and employees through activities such as enhanced strategic
partnerships, new learning modules to promote effective sponsorship and inclusive performance management, and new tools and resources to incorporate
DIE&B considerations across the business. We continue to evaluate DIE&B progress across the company and as part of the individual performance assessment
under our 2022 annual incentive plan for our senior executives. In addition, we empower eight employee resource groups to promote community and belonging
for employees that identify as Black, Latinx/Hispanic, women, interfaith, veterans, LGBTQ+, Asian, and disabled persons and their allies. These groups drive
ongoing employee engagement around the world for all employees, regardless of background, to support and champion their peers and related causes.
Our evolving workplace
We remain focused on creating a culture of flexibility and community by designing ways to collaborate across diverse workplace models, whether working
virtually, on-site, or using a hybrid approach. We empower functional leadership to determine the most appropriate workplace strategy for their teams to
optimize employee productivity and engagement and deliver on business priorities. Across PayPal, we are focused on providing tools and resources to support
our diverse and distributed teams. We believe this flexible approach has broadened our potential global talent pools.
As part of our annual ESG reporting, we provide additional information on our global talent strategy, including detailed representation metrics, in our Global
Impact Report.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information appearing in this Form 10-K, including our
consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that could affect us. These risk factors do not
identify all risks we face, and additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become
important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, future
prospects, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.
CYBERSECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY RISKS
Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition.
The techniques used to attempt to obtain unauthorized or illegal access to systems and information (including customers’ personal data), disable or degrade
service, exploit vulnerabilities, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving. In some circumstances, these attempts may not be recognized or detected until
after they have been launched against a target. Unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means,
including through hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners, or vendors, and attempting to fraudulently induce users of our
systems (including employees, vendor and partner personnel and customers) into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, multi-factor
authentication application access or other sensitive information used to gain access to such systems or facilities. This information may, in turn, be used to
access our customers’ confidential personal or proprietary information and financial instrument data that are stored on or accessible through our information
technology systems and those of third parties with whom we partner. This information may also be used to execute fraudulent transactions or otherwise engage
in fraudulent actions. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, cyberextortion, distributed denial-of-
service attacks, ransomware, spear phishing and social engineering schemes, the introduction of computer viruses or other malware, and the physical
destruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure and those of third parties with whom we partner, are becoming increasingly
sophisticated and complex, may be difficult to detect, and could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our systems, as well as
the systems themselves.
We believe that cybercriminals may target PayPal due to our name, brand recognition, types of data (including sensitive payments- and identity-related data)
that customers provide to us, and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in
the future, breaches of our security measures due to human error, deception, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors, defects, vulnerabilities, or other
irregularities. For example, in November 2017, we suspended the operations of TIO Networks (“TIO”) (acquired in July 2017) as part of an investigation of
security vulnerabilities of the TIO platform, and in December 2017, we announced that we had identified evidence of unauthorized access to TIO’s network
and the potential compromise of personally identifiable information for approximately 1.6 million TIO customers.
Any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies we acquire or of our customers, partners, or
vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects.
Under payment card network rules and our contracts with our payment processors, if there is a breach of payment card information stored by us or our direct
payment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks, including for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses.
Cybersecurity breaches and other exploited security vulnerabilities could subject us to significant costs and third-party liabilities, result in improper disclosure
of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to
loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the
operation of our business, result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to
or claims by them, or expose us to litigation, regulatory investigations, and significant fines and penalties. While we maintain insurance policies intended to
help offset the financial impact we may experience from these risks, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by security
breaches and other damage to or unavailability of our systems.
Business interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business.
Our systems and operations and those of our service providers and partners have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, business
interruptions or degradation of service because of distributed denial-of-service and other
17
Table of Contents
cyberattacks, insider threats, hardware and software defects or malfunctions, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other natural disasters,
public health crises (including pandemics), power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks,
computer viruses or other malware, or other events. The frequency and intensity of weather events related to climate change are increasing, which could
increase the likelihood and severity of such disasters as well as related damage and business interruption. Our corporate headquarters are located in the San
Francisco Bay Area, a seismically active region in California. A catastrophic event that could lead to a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could
result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures to resume or maintain operations. Further, some of our systems,
including those of companies that we have acquired, are not fully redundant and any failure of these acquired systems, including due to a catastrophic event,
may lead to operational outages or delays. While we engage in disaster recovery planning and testing intended to mitigate risks from outages or delays, our
planning and testing may not be sufficient for all possible outcomes or events. As a provider of payments solutions, we are also subject to heightened scrutiny
by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans, and rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and
time-consuming to implement, and may divert our resources from other business priorities. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse impact on
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, system failures, cyberattacks, unplanned outages, and other events or conditions from time to time
that have and may interrupt the availability, or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality, of our products and services and result in loss of revenue. A
prolonged interruption of, or reduction in, the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or
persistent interruptions in our services could permanently harm our relationship with our customers and partners and our reputation. If any system failure or
similar event results in damage to our customers or their business partners, they could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their
losses. These claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.
We continue to undertake system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve the availability, reliability, resiliency, and speed of our payments
platform. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical complexity and risk, may divert our resources from new features and
products, and may ultimately not be effective. Frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and
mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us
from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business.
We also rely on facilities, components, applications, software, and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud data storage and
processing services. From time to time, we have experienced interruptions in the provision of such facilities and services provided by these third parties. If
these third parties experience operational interference or disruptions (including a cybersecurity incident), fail to perform their obligations, or breach their
agreements with us, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, regulatory scrutiny, and
damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. While we maintain insurance policies intended to help offset the
financial impact we may experience from these risks, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by interruptions in our service
due to systems failures and similar events.
In addition, any failure to successfully implement new information systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and
technologies in a timely manner could adversely impact our business, internal controls, results of operations, and financial condition.
If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services
and, consequently, our revenues, could decline.
Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including payment technologies (including real-time
payments, payment card tokenization, virtual currencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and proximity payment technology such as Near Field
Communication and other contactless payments); internet browser technologies, that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any
retail or e-commerce website; artificial intelligence and machine learning; developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations;
and in-store, digital, and social commerce.
We expect that new technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the
technologies we currently use in our products and services. We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business, which technological
developments or innovations will become widely adopted, and how
18
Table of Contents
those technologies may be regulated. Developing and incorporating new technologies into new and existing products and services may require significant
investment, take considerable time, and may not ultimately be successful. We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the
development of and access to new or evolving technologies. These third parties may restrict or prevent our access to, or utilization of, those technologies, as
well as their platforms or products. Our ability to develop, provide or incorporate new technologies and adapt our existing products and services or develop
future and new products and services using new technologies may be limited or restricted by industry-wide standards, platform providers, payments networks,
changes to laws and regulations, changing customer expectations, third-party intellectual property rights, and other factors. If we are unable to develop and
incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be
harmed.
LEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS
Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently
changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business.
Our business is subject to complex and changing laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we offer services directly or
through partners, including those governing: banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, prepaid access, foreign currency
exchange, privacy, data protection, data governance, cybersecurity, banking secrecy, digital payments, cryptocurrency, payment services (including payment
processing and settlement services), fraud detection, consumer protection, antitrust and competition, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and
counter-terrorist financing.
Regulators globally are increasingly exercising regulatory authority, oversight, and enforcement in a manner that impacts our business. Further, as we introduce
new products and services and expand into new markets (including through acquisitions) and expand and localize our international activities, we expect to
become subject to additional regulations, restrictions, and licensing requirements. In addition, because we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to
customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws, which may impose different, more
specific, or conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability.
Any failure or alleged failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any government authority (including changes to their
interpretation) may subject us to significant fines and penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions; result in
additional compliance and licensure requirements; cause us to lose existing licenses or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be
required for our business; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; restrict or cease our operations; force us to make changes to our business practices,
products or operations; lead to increased friction for customers; require us to engage in remediation activities; delay planned transactions, product launches or
other activities, or divert management’s time and attention from our business. The complexity of United States (“U.S.”) federal and state and international
regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in one or
more events prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different
jurisdictions. While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no
assurance that our employees, contractors, and agents will not violate such laws and regulations. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate,
harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Payments Regulation
In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are
required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations required to maintain our licenses,
we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states or territories, forced to change our
business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs and harm our business.
While we currently allow our customers to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets
(including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can hold balances or withdraw
funds. These restrictions may limit our ability to grow our business.
Outside of the U.S., we principally provide our services to customers in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) through
PayPal (Europe), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit
19
Table of Contents
institution in Luxembourg. PayPal (Europe) may be subject to enforcement actions and significant fines if it violates applicable requirements. Additionally,
compliance with applicable laws and regulations could become more costly and operationally difficult to manage due to potentially inconsistent interpretations
and domestic regulations by various countries in the region. Applicable regulation relating to payments, anti-money laundering and digital services, which are
key focus areas of regulators and subject to extensive new regulation, could subject us to additional and complex obligations, risks and associated costs. If the
business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) so determines, PayPal (Europe) may be deemed a
significant supervised entity and certain activities of PayPal (Europe) would become directly supervised by the ECB, rather than by the Luxembourg
Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs. PayPal
(Europe) is also subject to regulation by the ECB under the oversight framework for electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements (PISA), which
may also lead to increased compliance obligations and costs.
In many of the other markets outside the U.S. in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in
Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”). The Payment Services Act came into effect in Singapore in
January 2020. PayPal Pte. Ltd. has submitted an application for a Major Payment Institution license to the MAS to continue to provide payments services, and
is operating under an exemption from holding a license within a statutory transition period while the application is pending. Upon PayPal Pte. Ltd. obtaining
this license, we will be required to comply with new regulatory requirements, which will result in increased operational complexity and costs for our Singapore
and international operations.
In many of the markets outside the U.S. (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd. or by local branches or subsidiaries subject to local regulatory
supervision or oversight, as the case may be, there may be uncertainty whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or also to other
local laws, and whether such local laws might require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution, or otherwise.
There are substantial costs and potential product and operational changes involved in maintaining and renewing licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we
could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, and litigation if we are found to violate any of these requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to (or decide to) continue to apply for or obtain any licenses, renewals, certifications, and approvals in any jurisdiction. In certain markets, we may need to
rely on local banks or other partners to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency, and local regulators may use
their authority over such local partners to prohibit, restrict, or limit us from doing business. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, result
in substantial additional costs, delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements, require significant and costly operational changes,
impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, products and services, or prevent or limit us from providing our products or
services in a given market.
Cryptocurrency Regulation and Related Risks
Our current and planned customer cryptocurrency offerings could subject us to additional regulations, licensing requirements, or other obligations. Within the
U.S., we are regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services as a virtual currency business, which does not qualify us to engage in securities
brokerage or dealing activities. The regulatory status of particular cryptocurrencies is unclear under existing law. For example, if the SEC were to assert that
any of the cryptocurrencies we support are securities, the SEC could assert that our activities involving that cryptocurrency require securities broker-dealer
registration or other obligations under the federal securities laws. The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape with respect to cryptocurrency may subject us to
additional licensing and regulatory obligations or to inquiries or investigations from the SEC, other regulators and governmental authorities, and require us to
make product changes, restrict or discontinue product offerings, implement additional and potentially costly controls, or take other actions. If we fail to comply
with regulations, requirements, prohibitions or other obligations applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions, potential fines, and
other consequences.
We hold our customers’ cryptocurrency assets through a third-party custodian. Financial and third-party risks related to our customer cryptocurrency offerings,
such as inappropriate access to, theft, or destruction of cryptocurrency assets held by our custodian, insufficient insurance coverage by the custodian to
reimburse us for all such losses, the custodian’s failure to maintain effective controls over the custody and settlement services provided to us, the custodian’s
inability to purchase or liquidate cryptocurrency holdings, and defaults on financial or performance obligations by the custodian, or counterparty financial
institutions, could expose our customers and us to loss, and therefore significantly harm our business, financial performance, and reputation.
20
Table of Contents
We have selected a custodian partner, and may in the future select additional custodian partners, that are subject to regulatory oversight, capital requirements,
maintenance of audit and compliance industry certifications, and cybersecurity procedures and policies. Nevertheless, operational disruptions at any such
custodian, or such custodian’s failure to safeguard cryptocurrency holdings could result in losses of customer assets, expose us to customer claims, reduce
consumer confidence and materially impact our operating results and our cryptocurrency product offerings.
Custodial arrangements to safeguard cryptocurrency assets involve unique risks and uncertainties in the event of the custodian’s bankruptcy. While other types
of assets and some custodied cryptocurrencies have been deemed not to be part of the custodian’s bankruptcy estate under various regulatory regimes,
bankruptcy courts have not yet definitively determined the appropriate treatment of custodial holdings of digital assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. In the event
of our custodian’s bankruptcy, the lack of precedent and the highly fact-dependent nature of the determination could delay or preclude the return of custodied
cryptocurrency assets to us or to our customers. Although, we contractually require our custodian to segregate our customer assets and not commingle them
with proprietary or other assets, we cannot be certain that these contractual obligations, even if duly observed by the custodian, will be effective in preventing
such assets from being treated as part of the custodian’s estate under bankruptcy or other insolvency law. In that event, our claim on behalf of such customers
against the custodian’s estate for our customers’ cryptocurrency assets could be treated as a general unsecured claim against the custodian, in which case our
customers could seek to hold us liable for any resulting losses.
In addition, our cryptocurrency product offerings could have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the risk factors described in this “Risk Factors”
section.
Lending Regulation
We hold a number of U.S. state lending licenses for our U.S. consumer short-term installment loan product, which is subject to federal and state laws governing
consumer credit and debt collection. While the consumer short-term installment loan products that we offer outside the U.S. are generally exempt from primary
consumer credit legislation, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection or banking transparency regulations continue to apply to these products.
Increased global regulatory focus on short-term installment products and consumer credit more broadly could result in laws or regulations requiring changes to
our policies, procedures, operations, and product offerings, and restrict or limit our ability to offer credit products, and we could be subject to enforcement
action, fines, and litigation if we are found to violate any aspects of applicable law or regulations.
Consumer Protection
Violations of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as
implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), could result in the assessment of significant actual damages or statutory damages or
penalties (including treble damages in some instances) and plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits
containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that
we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).
In addition, the CFPB, pursuant to its market-monitoring authority, may require us to provide extensive information on our products and offerings from time to
time. In 2021, we received separate orders from the CFPB pursuant to such market-monitoring authority requiring us to provide, among other items, extensive
information on our payment products, including with respect to the collection, use of, and access to data and consumer protections, as well as our Buy Now,
Pay Later offerings.
PayPal principally offers its services in the EEA countries through a “passport” notification process through PayPal (Europe)’s Luxembourg regulator to
regulators in other EEA member states in accordance with European Union (“EU”) regulations, as well as in the U.K. through the Temporary Permissions
Regime. Regulators in these countries could notify us of and seek to enforce local consumer protection laws that apply to our business, in addition to
Luxembourg consumer protection laws, or seek to persuade the local regulator to order PayPal to conduct its activities in the local country directly or through a
branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could impose additional obligations and costs and impact our ability to expand our business in
Europe and the U.K.
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing; Economic and Trade Sanctions
Regulators globally continue to increase standards and expectations regarding anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, and to expand the scope
of existing laws and regulations to emerging products and markets, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program globally and/or in
specific jurisdictions, including the procedures we use to
21
Table of Contents
verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Such changes could have the effect of making compliance more
costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Regulators regularly re-examine the
transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or the circumstances in which we must verify identities of customers, and
any change to such obligations could result in greater compliance costs and impact our business. We are also required to comply with economic and trade
sanctions administered by the U.S., the EU and its member states, the U.K., and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Non-compliance with anti-money
laundering laws and regulations or economic and trade sanctions may subject us to significant fines, penalties, lawsuits, and enforcement actions, result in
regulatory sanctions and additional compliance requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations, and damage our reputation
and brands. Our compliance history may be considered by OFAC and other regulators as part of any potential future investigation of our sanctions regulation.
Privacy and Protection of Customer Data
The legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws continues to develop and evolve in ways we cannot predict, including with
respect to technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. Any failure or alleged
failure by us to comply with our privacy policies as communicated to customers or with privacy and data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions
against us by data protection authorities, other government agencies, or others, which could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative
publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, result in reputational harm, and materially harm our
business. Compliance with inconsistent privacy and data protection laws may also restrict or limit our ability to provide products and services to our customers.
PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of EEA individuals to the U.S., including Binding Corporate Rules for internal
transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as approved by the European Commission for transfers to and from third
parties. In June 2021, the European Commission imposed new SCC requirements which impose certain contract and operational requirements on PayPal, its
merchants, and vendors to adhere to certain affirmative duties, including requirements related to government access transparency, enhanced data subject rights,
and broader third-party assessments to ensure safeguards necessary to protect personal data exported from PayPal’s EEA customers and/or employees to
countries outside the EEA. To the extent we rely on SCCs, we will potentially need to enter into new contractual arrangements reflecting the updated SCC
requirements to avoid limitations on PayPal’s ability to process EEA data in countries outside of the EEA.
Many jurisdictions in which we operate globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, data privacy legislation or regulations aimed at creating and
enhancing individual privacy rights. For example, numerous U.S. states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and
regulations governing the collection, use, and retention of their residents’ personal information. The continued proliferation of privacy laws in the jurisdictions
in which we operate is likely to result in a disparate array of privacy rules with unaligned or conflicting provisions, accountability requirements, individual
rights, and national or local enforcement powers, which may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs, and could lead to unintended
consumer confusion.
We are subject to regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to legal proceedings under antitrust and competition laws.
We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies regarding antitrust and competition laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including in
connection with proposed or implemented business combinations, acquisitions, investments, partnerships, commercial agreements and business practices.
Some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct. Companies and government
agencies have in the past alleged, and may in the future allege, that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws in the U.S. or other jurisdictions in
which we operate or otherwise constitute unfair competition, or that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business
practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without merit, may be costly to defend or respond to, involve negative
publicity, and cause substantial diversion of management’s time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments, fines and other
remedial actions against us, require us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay or preclude planned transactions,
product launches or improvements.
We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory scrutiny, and government inquiries.
We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, actions or
requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules, and regulations with
22
Table of Contents
respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing,
sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, consumer protection (including unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices), fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor
and employment, commercial disputes, services, charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, product liability,
use of our services for illegal purposes, the matters described in “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters—General
Matters” to our consolidated financial statements, and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries is expected to continue to
increase as our products, services, and business expand in complexity, scale, scope, and geographic reach, including through acquisitions of businesses and
technology. Investigations and legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and could result in substantial judgments,
fines, penalties or settlements, negative publicity, substantial diversion of management’s time and effort, reputational harm, criminal sanctions, or orders that
prevent or limit us from offering certain products or services; require us to change our business practices in costly ways, develop non-infringing or otherwise
altered products or technologies, or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees; or delay or preclude planned transactions or product launches or improvements.
Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves significant estimates and judgments and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties
and unpredictable outcomes. We may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. If any of our estimates and
assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.
Third parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights.
We are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property infringement
claims against us may result from, among other things, our expansion into new business areas, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology, or
new or expanded products and services and their convergence with technologies not previously associated with areas related to our business, products, and
services. The ultimate outcome of any allegation or claim is often uncertain and any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming to defend,
result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, result in reputational harm, and require us to, among other things, redesign
or stop providing our products or services, pay substantial amounts to settle claims or lawsuits, satisfy judgments, or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees.
We may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property.
The protection of our proprietary rights, including our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, patents and trade secrets, is important to the success
of our business. Effective protection of our proprietary rights may not be available in every jurisdiction in which we offer our products and services. Although
we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights
in every jurisdiction, that our contractual arrangements will prevent or deter third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property, or that
third parties will not independently develop equivalent or superior intellectual property rights. We may be required to expend significant time and resources to
prevent infringement and enforce our rights, and we may be unable to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. If we
are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or otherwise violating our proprietary rights, the uniqueness and value of our products and services could be
adversely affected, the value of our brands could be diminished, and our business could be adversely affected. We expect to continue to license in the future
certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our
proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could
diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business.
BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS RISKS
We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry.
The global payments industry is highly competitive, dynamic, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Many of the
areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of merchants and
consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses enter into business
combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.
We compete with a wide range of businesses in every aspect of our business. Some of our current and potential competitors are or may be larger than we are,
have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, a dominant or more secure position, broader geographic scope, volume, scale,
resources, and market share than we do, or offer products and
23
Table of Contents
services that we do not offer. Other competitors are or may be smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding to regulatory and
technological changes and customer preferences. Our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and
services, and/or offer lower prices or more effectively offer their own innovative programs, products, and services. We often partner with other businesses, and
the ability to continue establishing these partnerships is important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense, and there can be
no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish, grow, or maintain these partner relationships. If we are unable to differentiate our products and
services from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively and efficiently align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may
not be able to compete effectively. See “Item 1. Business—Competition” of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the competitive environment in the
markets where we operate.
Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business.
To process certain transactions, we must comply with applicable payment card, bank or other network (collectively, “network”) rules. The rules govern all
aspects of a transaction on the networks, including fees and other practices. From time to time, the networks have increased the fees and assessments that they
charge for transactions that access their networks. Certain networks have also imposed special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a
digital wallet such as the one that PayPal offers. Our payment processors may have the right to pass any increases in fees and assessments on to us and to
increase their own fees for processing. Any increase in interchange fees, special fees, or assessments for transactions that we pay to the networks or our
payment processors could make our pricing less competitive, increase our operating costs, and reduce our operating income, which could materially harm our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.
In some jurisdictions, government regulations have required payment card networks to reduce or cap interchange fees. Any changes in interchange fee rates or
limitations, or their applicability to PayPal, could adversely affect our competitive position against payment card service providers and the revenue we earn
from our branded card programs, require us to change our business practices, and harm our business.
We may also be subject to fines and other penalties assessed by networks resulting from any rule violations by us or our merchants. The networks set and
interpret their rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these rules. Such allegations may result in significant
fines, penalties, damages, or other liabilities or require changes in our business practices that may be costly and adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition. The network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise impact the development of, our
products which may negatively affect product deployment and adoption. The networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules
that we or our payment processors might find difficult or impractical to follow, or costly to implement, which could require us to make significant changes to
our products, increase our operational costs, and negatively impact our business. If we become unable or limited in our ability to accept certain payment types
such as debit or credit cards, our business would be materially and adversely affected.
Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business.
We pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, and
nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, from an existing PayPal account balance or
Venmo account balance, or through our PayPal branded consumer credit products. Our financial performance is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our
consumers fund payments using payment cards, which can significantly increase our costs. Although we provide consumers in certain markets with the
opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance or Venmo account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use
payment cards, which may offer features and benefits not provided as part of their PayPal accounts. Any increase in the portion of our payment volume funded
using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions
with lower-cost funding options, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business.
Our ability to receive the benefit of U.S. merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. installment loan products may be subject to challenge.
Merchant loans under our U.S. PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) and PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) products and certain U.S. installment loan products are
provided by a state-chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us, and we acquire the receivables generated by those loans from the state-
chartered bank after origination. In June 2020, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly
originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by
the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (“OCC”) in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and
24
Table of Contents
codifies the so-called “valid-when-made doctrine,” which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and
will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged
these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered
banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws
and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC, PPBL, certain installment products, and our business.
Our credit products expose us to additional risks.
We offer credit products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in the U.S. and various international markets. The financial success of these products
depends largely on the effective management of related risk. The credit decision-making process for our consumer credit products uses proprietary
methodologies and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors,
their past purchase and transaction history with PayPal or Venmo and their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to
assess merchants who desire to use our merchant financing offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the
creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions, including those related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions,
economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit
products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, issuing bank policies,
and other factors.
We generally rely on the activities and charters of unaffiliated financial institutions to provide PayPal and Venmo branded consumer credit and merchant
financing offerings to our U.S. customers. As a service provider to these unaffiliated financial institutions, which are federally supervised U.S. financial
institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators. In the event of any termination or interruption in a partner
bank’s ability or willingness to lend, our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant financing products could be interrupted or limited, which could
materially and adversely affect our business. We may be unable to reach a similar arrangement with another unaffiliated financial institution on favorable terms
or at all. Obtaining and maintaining the lending licenses required for us to originate such loans ourselves would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain
process, and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could significantly increase our costs and compliance obligations and
require us to change our business practices.
We are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk of potential charge-offs or
negatively impacting the revenue share arrangement with an independent chartered financial institution with respect to our U.S. consumer credit product. The
non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other factors, changes to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting
the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and
high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy
laws generally do not repay their loans.
We currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and
extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. If we are unable to fund our credit products or the
purchase of the receivables related to our credit products and offerings adequately or in a cost-effective manner, the growth of our credit products could be
negatively impacted.
We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.
We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment
card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our U.S. credit products to consumers, U.S. merchant
financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers;
and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (e.g., outsourced customer support and product development functions; facilities;
information technology, data center facilities and cloud computing). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party
providers, including legal, regulatory, information security, reputational and operational risks. We are undertaking efforts to diversify our reliance on a small
number of third-party payment processors in various markets. We are working with our primary payment processor in the U.S. to facilitate the migration of our
arrangements to other payment processors over a transition period in connection with the wind-down of our agreement; however, if we are unable to timely and
efficiently migrate our business to other payment processors or experience disruptions in connection with this transition, our business could be harmed. If we
are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to
25
Table of Contents
meet their obligations to us, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships, our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be
adversely impacted. Additionally, our relationships with third parties inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and
compliance, which potentially increases our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk.
Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.
Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-
border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In
certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) presence.
Cross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers or restrictions,
sanctions, import or export controls, and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign
exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or
impractical could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.
Failure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences may increase our loss rate and could
negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.
We expect that third parties will continue to attempt to abuse access to and misuse our payments services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating
fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information, making transactions with stolen financial instruments, abusing or
misusing our services for financial gain, or fraudulently inducing users of our systems into engaging in fraudulent transactions. Due to the nature of PayPal’s
digital payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale
that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions. Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive behavior are complex, require
continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection
with new or expanded product offerings. If these measures are not effective, our business could be negatively impacted. We also incur substantial losses from
erroneous transactions and situations where funding instruments used for legitimate transactions are closed or have insufficient funds to satisfy payments, or
the payment is initiated to an unintended recipient in error. Numerous and evolving fraud schemes and misuse of our payments services could subject us to
significant costs and liabilities, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence
in, or decreased use of, our products and services, damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business,
and result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses or claims.
Our Purchase and Seller Protection Programs (“protection programs”) are intended to reduce the likelihood of losses for consumers and merchants from
unauthorized and fraudulent transactions. The Purchase Protection Program also protects consumers who do not receive the item ordered or who receive an
item that is significantly different from its description. We incur substantial losses from our protection programs as a result of disputes filed by our customers.
We seek to recover losses from our protection programs from the merchant, but may not be able to fully recover our losses (for example, if the merchant is
unwilling or unable to pay, the transaction involves a fraudulent merchant, or the merchant provides sufficient evidence that the item was delivered).
In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal or Venmo may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer, which in turn will seek recovery
from us. If losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, we could lose the ability to accept payment cards for payment, which
would negatively impact our business. Regulators and card networks may also adapt error resolution and chargeback requirements to account for evolving
forms of fraud, which could increase PayPal’s exposure to fraud losses and impact the scope of coverage of our protection programs. Increases in our loss rate,
including as a result of changes to the scope of transactions covered by our protection programs, could negatively impact our business. See “Note 13—
Commitments and Contingencies—Protection Programs” to our consolidated financial statements.
Failure to effectively monitor and evaluate the financial condition of our merchants may expose PayPal to losses. In the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency,
business failure, or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise, or
concert tickets, custom-made goods, and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, including through our Purchase Protection
Program or through chargebacks on
26
Table of Contents
payment cards used by customers to fund their purchase. Allowances for transaction losses that we have established may be insufficient to cover incurred
losses.
Use of our payments services for illegal activities or improper purposes could harm our business.
We expect that users will continue to attempt to use our payments platform for illegal activities or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist
financing, sanctions evasion, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal telemarketing activities, illegal sales of prescription
medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted, trademarked or digital goods, bank fraud, child pornography,
human trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, securities fraud, pyramid or Ponzi schemes, or the facilitation of other illegal or
improper activity. Moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and a merchant may be found
responsible for intentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Owners of intellectual property rights or
government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of
infringing or allegedly infringing items by a user. While we invest in measures intended to prevent and detect illegal activities that may occur on our payments
platform, these measures require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing illegal activity or improper uses.
Any illegal or improper uses of our payments platform or failure by us to detect or prevent illegal or improper activity by our users may subject us to claims,
individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory requests, inquiries, or investigations that could result in liability, restrict our operations,
impose additional restrictions or limitations on our business or require us to change our business practices, harm our reputation, increase our costs, and
negatively impact our business.
Acquisitions, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business.
We expect to continue to consider and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business
combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets; strategic investments; and commercial and
strategic partnerships (collectively, “strategic transactions”). At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more
strategic transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no
assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, consummating and integrating favorable transaction opportunities. Strategic transactions may
involve additional significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including challenges of integrating new employees, products, systems, technologies,
operations, and business cultures; challenges associated with operating acquired businesses in markets or business areas in which we may have limited or no
experience; disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management’s attention; inadequate data security, cybersecurity, or operational and
information technology resilience; failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, deficiencies and other risks associated with acquired
businesses or assets; potential exposure to new or incremental risks associated with acquired businesses and entities, strategic investments and other strategic
transactions, including potential new or increased regulatory oversight and uncertain or evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements, particularly
with respect to companies in new or developing businesses or industries; failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy or for its anticipated
benefits to materialize; potential impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets; and the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive
issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of significant additional debt. Strategic transactions are inherently risky, may not be successful, and may
harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Strategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations. The success of our
strategic investments may be dependent on controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities that may have business interests, strategies, or
goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities
who control companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and damage our
reputation.
Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business.
Our international operations generate roughly one-half of our net revenues. Our international operations subject us to significant challenges, uncertainties, and
risks, including local regulatory, licensing, reporting, and legal obligations; costs and challenges associated with operating in markets in which we may have
limited or no experience, including effectively localizing our products and services and adapting them to local preferences; difficulties in developing, staffing,
and simultaneously managing
27
Table of Contents
a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences and in light of varying laws, regulations, and customs;
differing employment practices and the existence of works councils; difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and maintaining our company
culture; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; profit repatriation restrictions; potential tariffs, sanctions, fines, or other
trade barriers or restrictions; import or export regulations; compliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery, anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-money laundering and
counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations; the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions; and national or regional political, economic,
or social instability.
Our international operations also may heighten many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Any violations of the complex foreign and U.S.
laws, rules and regulations that may apply to our international operations may result in lawsuits, enforcement actions, criminal actions, or sanctions against us
and, our directors, officers, and employees; prohibit or require us to change our business practices; and damage our reputation. Although we have implemented
policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate
our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could materially and
adversely affect our business.
Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.
Adverse global and regional economic conditions such as turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets, including, but not limited to, tightening in
the credit markets, extreme volatility or distress in the financial markets (including the fixed income, credit, currency, equity, and commodity markets), higher
unemployment, high consumer debt levels, recessionary or inflationary pressures, supply chain issues, reduced consumer confidence or economic activity,
government fiscal and tax policies, U.S. and international trade relationships, agreements, treaties, tariffs and restrictive actions, the inability of a government
to enact a budget in a fiscal year, government shutdowns, government austerity programs, and other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments
could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our
payments platform. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets or increased regulatory
liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity position. Such conditions may also expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or
interest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results.
If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed.
Our reputation and brands are globally recognized, important to our business, and affect our ability to attract and retain our customers. There are numerous
ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. We may experience scrutiny or backlash from customers, partners, employees, government entities, media,
advocacy groups, and other influencers or stakeholders that disagree with, among other things, our product offering decisions or public policy positions.
Damage to our reputation or our brands may result from, among other things, new features, products, services, operational efforts, or terms of service (or
changes to the same), or our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or information security. The proliferation of social media may increase and
compound the likelihood, speed, magnitude, and unpredictability of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, our business and operating
results may be adversely impacted.
Brexit: The U.K.’s departure from the EU could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Following the departure of the U.K. from the EU and the EEA on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and the expiration of the transition
period on December 31, 2020, there continues to be uncertainty over the practical consequences of Brexit, including the potential for greater restrictions on the
supply and availability of goods and services between the U.K. and EEA region, and a general deterioration in consumer sentiment and credit conditions
leading to overall negative economic growth and increased risk of merchant default.
The consequences of Brexit have brought legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial services firms, which could continue as national laws and
regulations in the U.K. differ from EU laws and regulations and additional authorization requirements come into effect. These developments have led and could
lead in the future to additional regulatory costs and challenges for us. Specifically, PayPal (Europe) currently operates in the U.K. within the scope of its
passport permissions (as they existed at the end of the transition period) pursuant to the Temporary Permissions Regime pending the grant of new
authorizations by the U.K. financial regulators. If we are unable to obtain the required authorizations before the expiry of the longstop dates set by the U.K.
regulators under the Temporary Permissions Regime, our European operations could lose their ability to offer services within the U.K. market, or into the U.K.
market on a cross-border basis. Our European operations may
28
Table of Contents
also be required to comply with legal and regulatory requirements in the U.K. that may be in addition to, or inconsistent with, those of the EEA, in each case,
leading to increased complexity and costs.
Real or perceived inaccuracies in our key metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.
Our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems,
including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we
believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale. The
methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment.
We regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of
our metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms,
and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified
from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics
to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material.
Further, as our business develops, we may revise or cease reporting metrics if we determine that such metrics are no longer appropriate measures of our
performance. If investors, analysts, or customers do not consider our reported measures to be sufficient or to accurately reflect our business, we may receive
negative publicity, our reputation may be harmed, and our business may be adversely impacted.
Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and
damage our reputation.
Customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG practices, including with respect to global talent, cybersecurity, data
privacy and protection and climate change. If we do not adapt to and comply with new laws and regulations or changes to legal or regulatory requirements
concerning ESG matters, or fail to meet rapidly evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, our reputation may be harmed, customers
may choose to refrain from using our products and services, and our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. Further, we may experience
additional scrutiny or backlash from customers, partners, media, government entities, and other stakeholders that disagree if they perceive PayPal to not have
responded appropriately with respect to ESG matters.
We specifically recognize the inherent physical climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse
effects of climate change. For example, California, where our headquarters are located, has historically experienced, and is projected to continue to experience,
climate-related events more frequently, including drought, water scarcity, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts, and power shutoffs
associated with wildfire prevention. These extreme weather conditions may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or
resume operations and higher attrition. In addition, current and emerging legal and regulatory requirements with respect to climate change (e.g., carbon pricing)
and other aspects of ESG (e.g., disclosure requirements) may result in increased compliance requirements on our business and supply chain, which may
increase our operating costs and cause disruptions in our operations.
If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.
We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, receivables outstanding, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial
institutions in the U.S. and international jurisdictions. As part of our foreign currency hedging activities, we regularly enter into transactions involving
derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and other financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We
regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be
exposed to the risk of default on obligations by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. If
one of our counterparty financial institutions were to become insolvent, placed into receivership, or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as
a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited, held in accounts with, or otherwise due from, such counterparty may be limited due to
the insufficiency of the failed institutions’ estate to satisfy all claims in full or the applicable laws or regulations governing the insolvency, bankruptcy, or
resolution proceedings. In the event of default on obligations by, or the failure of, one or more of these counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which
could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.

There are risks associated with our indebtedness.
We have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness
is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt. Our outstanding indebtedness and any
additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including the need to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other
available cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, strategic
investments, and share repurchases; the reduction of our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business, competitive pressures and market
conditions; and limits on our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, strategic investments, share
repurchases, or other general corporate purposes.
Our revolving credit facilities and the indentures for our senior unsecured notes pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain
financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business and operations. If we fail to pay amounts due under a debt
instrument or breach any of its covenants, the lenders or noteholders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings
thereunder (subject in certain cases to a grace or cure period). Moreover, any such acceleration and required repayment of, or default in respect of, our
indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments, thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of our
indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.
Changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing
costs. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase, and our
ability to obtain additional financing in the future on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected.
Changes in tax laws, exposure to unanticipated additional tax liabilities, or implementation of reporting or record-keeping obligations could have a
material adverse effect on our business.
An increasing number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and governments of foreign jurisdictions, such as the EU Commission, as well as
international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, are focused on tax reform and other legislative or
regulatory action to increase tax revenue. For example, various countries have proposed or enacted digital services taxes. These actions may materially affect
our effective tax rate.
The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many
transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits, and reviews
by tax authorities in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could result in unforeseen tax-related
liabilities that differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements, which may, individually or in the aggregate, materially affect our financial results in
the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to
cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.
In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by the incurrence of losses or earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have
lower statutory tax rates, and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our
deferred tax assets and liabilities, including as a result of gains on our foreign currency exchange risk management program; by changes in tax laws,
regulations, or accounting principles; or by certain discrete items.
A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and foreign jurisdictions have implemented and may impose reporting or record-keeping obligations on
companies that engage in or facilitate e-commerce to improve tax compliance. A number of jurisdictions are also reviewing whether payment service providers
and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet applicable
requirements and expect that further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact our customer experience
and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary
penalties and other sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business.

We may be unable to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business.
Competition for key and other highly skilled personnel is intense, especially for executive talent, software engineers, and other technology talent. We may be
limited in our ability to recruit or hire internationally, including due to restrictive laws or policies on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled
workers. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our inability to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain key and other highly qualified and
diverse talent, whether in a remote or in-office environment, or protect the safety, health and productivity of our workforce could harm our overall business and
results of operations.
We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services.
We may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through our online services, including claims alleging defamation, libel, harassment, hate
speech, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the
materials disseminated through the services, among other things. We invest in measures intended to detect and block activities that may occur on our payments
platform in violation of our policies and applicable laws. These measures require continuous improvement and may not be sufficiently effective in detecting
and preventing the exchange of information in violation of our policies and applicable laws. If these measures are not sufficiently effective, our business could
be negatively impacted. If the laws or regulations that provide protections for online dissemination of information are invalidated or are modified to reduce
protections available to us and we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we could be directly
harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product
or service offerings, which could harm our business.

COMMON STOCK
PayPal common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “PYPL.”
As of February 3, 2023, there were 4,123 holders of record of our common stock. The actual number of stockholders is significantly greater than this number of
record holders, and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees.
DIVIDEND POLICY
We have never paid any cash dividends and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
STOCK REPURCHASE ACTIVITY
In July 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock, with no
expiration from the date of authorization. In June 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the
repurchase of up to $15 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. Our stock repurchase programs are intended to offset
the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic
repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open
market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions including accelerated share repurchase agreements or other means at times and in such
amounts as management deems appropriate, and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Moreover, any stock repurchases are
subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. We may terminate our stock
repurchase programs at any time without prior notice.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
THE COMPANY
We are a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide.
PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services to help improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for
entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around the world. Our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in
the world in the markets we serve, anytime, on any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid, including person-to-person
payments.
Regulatory environment
We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments
industry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable
to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation.
New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions
related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely
and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.
33

Information security
Information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have increased significantly in recent years. Although we have developed
systems and processes designed to protect the data we manage, prevent data loss and other security incidents, and effectively respond to known and potential
risks, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, we remain subject to these risks and there can be no assurance that our
security measures will provide sufficient security or prevent breaches or attacks. For additional information regarding our information security risks, see “Item
1A. Risk Factors—Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition.”
RUSSIA AND UKRAINE CONFLICT
With respect to the military hostilities commenced by Russia in Ukraine in February 2022, our priority is the safety and well-being of our PayPal employee
community impacted by these events. We continue to take actions to comply with all applicable restrictions and sanctions that may impact our operations. In
March 2022, we suspended our transactional services in Russia. We are unable to reasonably estimate the total potential financial impact that may ultimately
result from this situation. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our total net revenues related to Russia and Ukraine were not material.
BREXIT
The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) formally exited the European Union (“EU”) and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) on January 31, 2020 (commonly
referred to as “Brexit”) with the expiration of the transition period on December 31, 2020. PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, SCA (“PayPal (Europe)”) operates in
the U.K. within the scope of its passport permissions (as they stood at the end of the transition period) under the Temporary Permissions Regime pending the
grant of new U.K. authorizations by the U.K. financial regulators. We are currently unable to determine the longer-term impact that Brexit will have on our
business, which will depend, in part, on the implications of new tariff, trade, and regulatory frameworks that now govern the provision of cross-border goods
and services between the U.K. and the EEA, as well as the financial and operational consequences of the requirement for PayPal (Europe) to obtain new U.K.
authorizations to operate its business longer-term within the U.K. market. For additional information on how Brexit could affect our business, see “Item 1A.
Risk Factors—Brexit: The U.K.'s departure from the EU could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”
Brexit may contribute to instability in financial, stock, and foreign currency exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro.
We have foreign currency exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements. The
tables below provide the percentage of our total net revenues and gross loans and interest receivable from the U.K. and EU for the periods presented:
Year Ended December 31,
2022 2021 2020
Net revenues generated from the U.K. 8 % 9 % 11 %
Net revenues generated from the EU 17 % 19 % 19 %
December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021
Gross loans and interest receivable due from customers in the U.K. 29 % 40 %
Gross loans and interest receivable due from customers in the EU 28 % 21 %
The change in the percentage of gross loans and interest receivable due from customers in the U.K. and EU year over year was primarily attributable to
expansion of our installment credit products in the EU, particularly in Germany where we have increased our product offerings.
MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
The broader implications of the macroeconomic environment, including uncertainty around the duration and severity of the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-
19”), the Russia and Ukraine conflict, supply chain shortages, a recession globally or in markets in which we operate, higher inflation rates, higher interest
rates, and other related global economic conditions, remain unknown. A deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could increase the risk of lower consumer
spending, merchant and consumer bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, higher credit losses, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, or other business
interruption, which may adversely impact our business. If these conditions continue or worsen, they could adversely impact our future operating results.

statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information.
** Not meaningful.
Net revenues increased $2.1 billion, or 8%, in 2022 compared to 2021 driven primarily by growth in total payment volume (“TPV”, as defined below under
“Key Metrics”) of 9%.
Total operating expenses increased $2.6 billion, or 12%, in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to an increase in transaction expense, and to a lesser extent,
increases in transaction and credit losses, technology and development expenses, and restructuring and other charges, partially offset by a decline in sales and
marketing expenses.
Operating income decreased $425 million, or 10%, in 2022 compared to 2021 due to growth in operating expenses exceeding growth in net revenues. Our
operating margin was 14% and 17% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Operating margin for 2022 was negatively impacted primarily by increases in transaction
expense and transaction and credit losses.
Net income decreased by $1.8 billion, or 42%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to the previously discussed decrease in operating income of $425 million,
higher expense of $308 million in other income (expense), net, driven primarily by losses on strategic investments, and an increase in income tax expense of
$1.0 billion primarily related to lower benefits associated with stock-based compensation deductions, and higher expense related to intra-group transfers of
intellectual property.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES
We have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian
dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency exchange risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the United States
(“U.S.”) dollar versus the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international
operations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, we
generated approximately 43%, 46%, and 49% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the U.S., respectively. Because we generate substantial
net revenues internationally, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the U.S., including those discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to
current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency
exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, intended to reduce the impact
on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component
of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings.(1)
(1) 
35
Table of Contents
In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following
impact on our reported results:
Year Ended December 31,
2022 2021
(In millions)
(Unfavorable) favorable impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging impact) $ (949) $ 440 
Hedging impact 462 (190)
(Unfavorable) favorable impact to net revenues (487) 250 
Favorable (unfavorable) impact to operating expense 492 (181)
Net favorable impact to operating income $ 5 $ 69 
While we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements, it is
impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure.
We also use foreign currency exchange contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk related to our investment
in certain foreign subsidiaries. Gains and losses associated with these instruments will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the
underlying foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated.
Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our
subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset
the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and
liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency
exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.
Additionally, in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates
daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates and when transactions occur.
KEY METRICS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
KEY METRICS
TPV, number of payment transactions, active accounts, and number of payment transactions per active account are key non-financial performance metrics
(“key metrics”) that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and are defined as
follows:
•TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment
solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.
•Number of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or
enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.
•An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not
including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to
PayPal’s platform or services through such third-party’s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout
capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly,
a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale
of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results.

•Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period, divided by
active accounts at the end of the period. The number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average
number of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The number of times a consumer account or a
merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account.
As our transaction revenue is typically correlated with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform, management
uses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform, the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and
trends which may be indicators of current and future performance. We present these key metrics to enhance investors’ evaluation of the performance of our
business and operating results.
Our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems,
including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we
believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at our scale. The
methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment.
We regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of
our metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes, and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms,
and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified
from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics
to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material.
NET REVENUES
Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:
•Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the TPV completed on our payments
platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform. We earn additional
fees from merchants and consumers: on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e.,
transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal
or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers
that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees.
•Revenues from other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees,
gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of
loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.
Our revenues can be significantly impacted by a number of factors, including the following:
 
•The mix of merchants, products, and services;
•The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;
•The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and
•The amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers.
Refer to “Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K for further discussion on factors that may impact our revenue.

Net revenue analysis
The components of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows (in millions):
Transaction revenues
Transaction revenues grew by $1.8 billion, or 8%, in 2022 compared to 2021 driven primarily by growth in our unbranded card processing volume, which
consists primarily of our Braintree products and services, and to a lesser extent, Venmo products and services, in each case driven by growth in TPV and the
number of payment transactions on our payments platform. This growth in transaction revenues was partially offset by a decline in TPV and revenue generated
from our core PayPal products and services, including foreign currency exchange fees revenue, due primarily to a decrease in revenue earned on eBay’s
marketplace platform. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2022, transaction revenues included $190 million in contractual compensation from
sellers that violated our contractual terms, compared to $82 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This contractual compensation and the year-over-
year increase are predominantly attributable to activity in international markets.
The graphs below present the respective key metrics (in millions) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:
*Reflects active accounts at the end of the applicable period. Active accounts as of December 31, 2021 include 3.2 million active accounts contributed by Paidy, Inc. (“Paidy”) on the date of
acquisition in October 2021.

We had active accounts of 435 million and 426 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 2%. Number of payment transactions
was 22.3 billion and 19.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 16%. TPV was $1.36 trillion and $1.25 trillion as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 9%.
38
Table of Contents
Transaction revenues grew more slowly than TPV and the number of payment transactions in 2022 due primarily to declines in foreign currency exchange fees,
TPV attributable to eBay’s marketplace (where we had historically earned higher rates), and a decline in revenues from core PayPal products and services,
partially offset by a favorable impact from hedging and an increase in revenue from our Venmo products and services.
Revenues from other value added services
Revenues from other value added services increased by $343 million, or 17%, in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to an increase in interest earned on
certain assets underlying customer account balances resulting from higher interest rates, our revenue share earned from an independent chartered financial
institution (“partner institution”), and interest and fee revenue on our merchant loans receivable portfolio. Growth in revenues from other value added services
in the current period was partially offset by the impact of revenue earned from the servicing of loans facilitated under the U.S. Government’s Paycheck
Protection Program in 2021 of $157 million, for which revenue was de minimis in the current period.
Consumers that have outstanding loans and interest receivable due to the partner institution may experience hardships that result in losses recognized by the
partner institution, which may result in a decrease in our revenue share earned in future periods. In the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit
programs funded by the partner institution does not meet a minimum rate of return (“minimum return threshold”) in a particular quarter, our revenue share for
that period would be zero. Further, in the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs managed by the partner institution does not meet the
minimum return threshold as measured over four consecutive quarters and in the following quarter, we would be required to make a payment to the partner
institution, subject to certain limitations. Through December 31, 2022, the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs funded by the partner
institution exceeded the minimum return threshold.
Seasonality
The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2022, 2021, or 2020 accounted for more than
30% of annual net revenue.

Transaction expense
Transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment. These costs include fees paid to payment
processors and other financial institutions when we draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account, or other funding source they have stored
in their digital wallet. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix.” The cost of funding a transaction with a credit
or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal or Venmo account balance or
our consumer credit products. As we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers, our funding mix may change,
which could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which
a transaction occurs, as we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit or debit cards outside the U.S. Our transaction expense rate is impacted
by changes in product mix, merchant mix, regional mix, funding mix, and fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions. Macroeconomic
environment changes may also result in behavioral shifts in consumer spending patterns affecting the type of funding source they use, which could also impact
the funding mix.
Transaction expense increased by $1.9 billion, or 18%, in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to an increase in TPV of 9% and unfavorable changes in
product mix. The increase in transaction expense rate in 2022 compared to 2021 was also attributable to unfavorable changes in product mix with a higher
proportion of TPV from unbranded card processing volume, which generally has higher expense rates than other products and services. For the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, approximately 35%, 39%, and 40% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S.
Transaction and credit losses
Transaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Credit losses include the current expected
credit losses associated with our merchant and consumer loans receivable portfolio. Our transaction and credit losses fluctuate depending on many factors,
including TPV, product mix, current and projected macroeconomic conditions such as unemployment rates, retail e-commerce sales and household disposable
income, merchant insolvency events, changes to and usage of our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of
loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchants. Estimating our current expected
credit loss allowances for our loans receivable portfolios is an inherently uncertain process and the ultimate losses we incur may vary from the current
estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the ultimate losses incurred. A
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or other factors beyond those considered in our estimates could result in credit losses that exceed our current
estimated credit losses and adversely impact our future operating results.

Table of Contents
The components of our transaction and credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows (in millions):
Transaction and credit losses increased by $512 million, or 48%, in 2022 compared to 2021.
Transaction losses were approximately $1.2 billion for both 2022 and 2021, reflecting an increase of $17 million, or 1%. Transaction loss rate (transaction
losses divided by TPV) was 0.09%, 0.09%, and 0.12% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase in transaction losses
in 2022 was attributable to an increase in losses related to our Venmo products and services resulting from fraud schemes, an increase in goods and services
transactions which are now eligible for coverage by our protection programs, and a loss related to a merchant insolvency proceeding, which was offset by
recoveries attributable to enhancements in our fraud recoupment capabilities and benefits from continued risk mitigation strategies. In the second quarter of
2022, we recorded a $114 million estimated loss related to the above mentioned merchant insolvency proceeding, and in the fourth quarter of 2022, this
estimated loss was reduced by approximately $75 million to account for recoveries and changes in our estimated loss reserve.
Credit losses increased by $495 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The components of credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020
were as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2022 2021 2020
Net char ge-of fs $ 267 $ 219 $ 310 
Reserve build (release) 135 (312) 296 
Credit losses $ 402 $ (93) $ 606 
Net charge-offs includes principal charge-offs partially offset by recoveries for consumer and merchant receivables.
Reserve build (release) represents change in allowance for principal receivables excluding foreign currency remeasurement and, for 2020, impact of adoption of the current expected credit loss
accounting standard.
The provision for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to loan originations during the period and a slight deterioration in the credit
quality of loans outstanding. The benefit for the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to a reduction of our allowance for loans and interest
receivable due primarily to improvements in both current and projected macroeconomic conditions at that point in time and the credit quality of loans
outstanding, partially offset by an increase in the allowance due to originations. During 2022 and 2021, allowances for our merchant and consumer portfolios
included qualitative adjustments that took into account uncertainty with respect to macroeconomic conditions, and uncertainty around the financial health of
our borrowers and effectiveness of loan modification programs made available to merchants.
The consumer loans and interest receivable balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $5.9 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, net of participation
interest sold, representing a year-over-year increase of 53% driven by the expansion of our installment credit products. Approximately 37% and 53% of our
consumer loans receivable outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were due from consumers in the U.K. The decline in the percentage of
consumer loans receivable outstanding in the U.K. at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 was due to overall growth in the consumer loan
portfolio, particularly from installment credit products in other markets including Germany, the U.S., and Japan.(1)

 Net charge-off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses, excluding fraud losses, on consumer loans as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivable balance
during the period.
We offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses, which we refer to as our merchant finance offerings. Total
merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable outstanding, net of participation interest sold, as of December 31, 2022 was $2.1 billion compared to
$1.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, representing a year-over-year increase of 48%. The increase in merchant loans, advances and interest and fees receivable
outstanding was due primarily to growth in our PayPal Business Loan products in the U.S. Approximately 86% and 5% of our merchant receivables
outstanding as of December 31, 2022 were due from merchants in the U.S. and U.K., as compared to approximately 82% and 8% as of December 31, 2021,
respectively.
The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance:

Percent of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable > 90 days outstanding 3.7 % 3.1 %
Net char ge-of f rate 4.5 % 4.7 %
 Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the original expected or contractual repayment period, as applicable.
Net charge-off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses, excluding fraud losses, on merchant loans and advances as a percentage of the average daily amount of merchant loans, advances, and
interest and fees receivable balance during the period.
We continue to evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters in response to the changing macroeconomic environment. Following a reduction in
originations in merchant loans and advances in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to our acceptable risk parameters in 2021 and 2022 resulted in a
gradual increase in originations, and thus a higher merchant receivable balance as of December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021. Modifications to
the acceptable risk parameters for our consumer credit products did not have a material impact on our consumer loans in the periods presented.
For additional information, see “Note 11—Loans and Interest Receivable” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—
Our credit products expose us to additional risks” included in this Form 10-K.
Customer support and operations
Customer support and operations includes costs incurred in our global customer operations centers, including costs to provide call support to our customers,
costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our merchants and consumers, and other costs incurred related to the delivery of our products,
including payment devices, card production, and customer onboarding and compliance costs.

Table of Contents
Customer support and operations costs increased $45 million, or 2%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily attributable to increases in
expenses related to software that supports our consumer loan products, customer onboarding and compliance costs, other operating charges, and costs
associated with the production of PayPal and Venmo branded debit and credit cards, partially offset by a decline in contractors and consulting costs.
Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing includes costs incurred for customer acquisition, business development, advertising, and marketing programs.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased $188 million, or 8%, in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to lower spending on marketing campaigns compared to
the prior year and declines in employee-related and consulting costs, partially offset by an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles and payments made
to our channel partners.
Technology and development
Technology and development includes costs incurred in connection with the development of our payments platform, new products, and the improvement of our
existing products, including the amortization of software and website development costs incurred in developing our payments platform, which are capitalized.
It also includes acquired developed technology and our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our payments platform.
Technology and development expenses increased $215 million, or 7%, in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to increases in employee-related expenses and
cloud computing services utilized in delivering our products and services, partially offset by a decline in costs related to contractors and consultants.
43
Table of Contents
General and administrative
General and administrative includes costs incurred to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources, finance, risk and compliance,
executive, and other support operations.
General and administrative expenses decreased $15 million, or 1%, in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to declines in professional services and employee-
related expenses due in part to a decline in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in costs associated with enterprise software
services.
Restructuring and other charges
Restructuring and other charges primarily consist of restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges.
Restructuring and other charges increased by $145 million in 2022 compared to 2021.
During the first quarter of 2022, management initiated a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce intended to streamline and optimize our global
operations to enhance operating efficiency. This effort focused on reducing redundant operations and simplifying our organizational structure. The associated
restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2022 were $121 million. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, as well as
associated consulting costs. The strategic actions associated with this plan were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2022. The estimated reduction
in annualized employee-related costs associated with the impacted workforce was approximately $265 million, including approximately $100 million in stock-
based compensation. A portion of the reduction in annual costs associated with the impacted workforce was reinvested in the business to drive additional
growth.
During the first quarter of 2020, management approved a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce as part of a multiphase process to reorganize our
workforce concurrently with the redesign of our operating structure, which spanned multiple quarters. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the
associated restructuring charges were $27 million. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, as well as associated consulting costs under
the 2020 strategic reduction, which was substantially completed in 2021.
For information on the associated restructuring liability, see “Note 17—Restructuring and Other Charges” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
included in this Form 10-K.
Additionally, we are continuing to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset
impairment charges of $81 million and $26 million, respectively, due to exiting certain leased properties which resulted in a reduction of right-of-use lease
assets and related leasehold improvements.
44
Table of Contents
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net of $(471) million in 2022 increased $308 million as compared to $(163) million in 2021 due primarily to net losses and
impairments on strategic investments incurred in the period compared to net gains in the prior period and, to a lesser extent, an increase in interest expense due
in part to incremental expense from our May 2022 fixed rate debt, partially offset by an increase in interest income due to an increase in interest rates.
Income tax expense (benefit)
Our effective income tax rate was 28% in 2022 and (2)% in 2021. The increase in our effective income tax rate in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily
attributable to a decrease in discrete tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation deductions and an increase in tax expense related to the intra-group
transfer of intellectual property. See “Note 16—Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on our
effective tax rate.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including our customer protection programs, credit products, capital expenditures,
investments in our business, potential acquisitions and strategic investments, working capital, and other cash needs. We believe that our existing cash, cash
equivalents, and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external
funding through third party sources, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements within the next 12 months and beyond.

2021, respectively.
Cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were $8.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and $7.4 billion at December 31, 2021, or
62% and 57%, of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of those respective dates. At December 31, 2022, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and
investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation under Subpart F, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) or the one-time
transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”). Subsequent repatriations to the U.S. will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective,
but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax.
A significant aspect of our global cash management activities involves meeting our customers’ requirements to access their cash while simultaneously meeting
our regulatory financial ratio commitments in various jurisdictions. Our global cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our
businesses, but also to support our global regulatory requirements across our regulated subsidiaries. Accordingly, not all of our cash is available for general
corporate purposes.(1)(2)

Operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between expenses recognized for provision
for transaction and credit losses and actual cash transaction losses incurred, and changes in other assets and liabilities. Significant non-cash expenses for the
period include depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. The cash impact from actual transaction losses incurred during a period is
reflected as changes in other assets and liabilities. The expenses recognized during the period for provision for credit losses are estimates of current expected
credit losses on our merchant and consumer credit products. Actual charge-offs of receivables related to our merchants and consumer credit products have no
impact on cash from operating activities.
The net cash generated from operating activities of $5.8 billion in 2022 was due primarily to operating income of $3.8 billion, as well as adjustments for non-
cash expenses including provision for transaction and credit losses of $1.6 billion, depreciation and amortization of $1.3 billion, and stock-based compensation
of $1.3 billion. Cash flows from operating activities was also impacted by changes in income taxes payable of $373 million, net losses on our strategic
investments of $304 million, and an increase in other liabilities of $483 million. These changes, which favorably impacted cash generated from operations,
were partially offset by actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period of $1.2 billion and changes in deferred income taxes of $811 million.
The net cash generated from operating activities of $5.8 billion in 2021 was due primarily to operating income of $4.3 billion, as well as adjustments for non-
cash expenses including stock-based compensation of $1.4 billion, depreciation and amortization of $1.3 billion, and provision for transaction and credit losses
of $1.1 billion. Cash flows from operating activities was also impacted by actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period of $1.2 billion, changes in
deferred income taxes of $482 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $222 million, and changes in other assets and liabilities of $287 million.
The net cash generated from operating activities of $6.2 billion in 2020 was due primarily to operating income of $3.3 billion, as well as adjustments for non-
cash expenses including provision for transaction and credit losses of $1.7 billion, stock-based compensation of $1.4 billion, and depreciation and amortization
of $1.2 billion. Cash flows from operating activities was also impacted by net gains on our strategic investments of $1.9 billion and actual cash transaction
losses incurred during the period of $1.1 billion, partially offset by increase in other liabilities of $1.0 billion.
Cash paid for income taxes, net in 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $878 million, $474 million, and $565 million, respectively.
Investing activities
Cash flows from investing activities includes purchases, maturities and sales of investments, cash paid for acquisitions and strategic investments, purchases and
sales of property and equipment, purchases, originations, and principal repayment of loans receivable, changes in funds receivable, and changes in collateral

The net cash used in investing activities of $3.4 billion in 2022 was due primarily to purchases and originations of loans receivable of $28.2 billion, purchases
of investments of $20.2 billion, changes in funds receivable from customers of $2.8 billion, and purchases of property and equipment of $706 million. These
cash outflows were partially offset by principal repayment of loans receivable of $24.9 billion and maturities and sales of investments of $23.4 billion.
The net cash used in investing activities of $5.1 billion in 2021 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $40.1 billion, purchases and originations of
loans receivable of $13.4 billion, acquisitions (net of cash acquired) of $2.8 billion, and purchases of property and equipment of $908 million. These cash
outflows were partially offset by maturities and sales of investments of $39.7 billion, principal repayment of loans receivable of $11.8 billion, changes in
collateral posted related to derivative instruments, net of $336 million, and changes in funds receivable from customers of $193 million.
The net cash used in investing activities of $16.5 billion in 2020 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $41.5 billion, purchases and originations of
loans receivable of $6.1 billion, acquisitions (net of cash acquired) of $3.6 billion, changes in funds receivable from customers of $1.6 billion, purchases of
property and equipment of $866 million, and changes in collateral posted related to derivative instruments, net of $327 million. These cash outflows were
partially offset by maturities and sales of investments of $30.9 billion, principal repayment of loans receivable of $6.4 billion and proceeds from the sale of
property and equipment of $120 million.
Financing activities
Cash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of common stock, purchases of treasury stock, tax withholdings related to net share
settlements of equity awards, borrowings and repayments under financing arrangements, changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers, and changes
in collateral received related to derivative instruments, net.
The net cash used in financing activities of $1.1 billion in 2022 was due primarily to the repurchase of $4.2 billion of our common stock under our July 2018
stock repurchase program, repayments of borrowings under financing arrangements of $1.7 billion (including the repurchase and redemption of certain fixed
rate notes and repayment of borrowings under a prior credit agreement, both described below under “Available credit and debt”), and tax withholdings of $336
million related to net share settlement of equity awards. These cash outflows were partially offset by borrowings under financing arrangements of $3.5 billion
(including proceeds from the issuance of fixed rate debt in May 2022 and borrowings under our Paidy credit agreements) and changes in funds payable and
amounts due to customers of $1.5 billion.
The net cash used in financing activities of $557 million in 2021 was due primarily to the repurchase of $3.4 billion of our common stock under our July 2018
stock repurchase program, tax withholdings of $1.0 billion related to net share settlement of equity awards, and repayments of borrowings under Paidy credit
agreements of $361 million. The cash outflows were partially offset by changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $3.6 billion, cash proceeds
from borrowings under our Paidy credit agreements of $272 million, and changes in collateral received related to derivative instruments, net of $207 million.
The net cash generated from financing activities of $12.5 billion in 2020 was due primarily to changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $10.6
billion and $7.0 billion of cash proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in the form of fixed rate notes in May 2020 as well as proceeds from borrowings
under our Credit Agreement (as defined below under “Available credit and debt”). These cash inflows were partially offset by repayment of outstanding
borrowings under our Credit Agreement of $3.0 billion, the repurchase of $1.6 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and tax
withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $521 million.
Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash
Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of $155 million, a negative impact of $102 million, and a positive impact of $169 million on cash, cash
equivalents, and restricted cash during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which resulted primarily from the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the
U.S. dollar to the Australian dollar. The negative impact of foreign currency exchange on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2022 was also
attributable, to a lesser extent, to the fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Swedish krona, Japanese yen, Indian rupee, and the Euro. The
negative impact of foreign currency exchange on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2021 was also attributable, to a lesser extent, to the fluctuations
in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Euro and Swedish krona.

Available credit and debt
In February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Paidy Credit Agreement”) with Paidy as co-borrower, which provides for an unsecured revolving
credit facility of ¥60.0 billion. In September 2022, the Paidy Credit Agreement was modified to increase the borrowing capacity by ¥30.0 billion for a total
borrowing capacity of ¥90.0 billion (approximately $686 million as of December 31, 2022). In the year ended December 31, 2022, ¥64.3 billion
(approximately $491 million) was drawn down under the Paidy Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022, ¥25.7 billion (approximately
$195 million) of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Paidy Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.
In October 2021, we assumed a credit agreement through our acquisition of Paidy (the “Prior Credit Agreement”). The Prior Credit Agreement provided for a
secured revolving credit facility of approximately ¥22.8 billion (approximately $198 million at the time of acquisition). In the first quarter of 2022, we
terminated the Prior Credit Agreement and repaid outstanding borrowings.
In September 2019, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility
that includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $500 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility
reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. As of December 31, 2022, no borrowings were
outstanding under the Credit Agreement and as such, $5.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement,
subject to customary conditions to borrowing.
We maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world with a borrowing capacity of approximately $80 million in the aggregate,
where we can withdraw and utilize the funds at our discretion for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022, the majority of the borrowing capacity
under these credit facilities was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.
In May 2022, May 2020 and September 2019, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of $12.0 billion
(collectively referred to as the “Notes”). Proceeds from the issuance of these Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding the
repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and possible acquisitions of businesses, assets, or
strategic investments. In May 2022, we used a portion of the proceeds from that debt issuance to repurchase and redeem $1.6 billion in notes from our prior
debt issuances in September 2019 and May 2020. As of December 31, 2022, we had $10.4 billion in fixed rate debt outstanding with varying maturity dates.
For additional information, see “Note 12—Debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Depending on market conditions, we may from time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to fund our operating activities, finance
acquisitions, make strategic investments, repurchase shares under our stock repurchase programs, or reduce our cost of capital.
We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the
financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). The arrangement also
allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash
Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement. As of December 31, 2022, we
had a total of $1.7 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $1.7 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling
arrangement.
Credit ratings
As of December 31, 2022, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC, Fitch Ratings, Inc., and Moody’s
Investors Services Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of
operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or
put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our
credit agreements.

CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS
Our material cash requirements include funds to support current and potential: operating activities, credit products, customer protection programs, stock
repurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, and capital expenditures and other future obligations.
Credit products
Growth in our portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs, and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We
are currently evaluating partnerships and third-party sources of funding for our credit products.
In June 2018, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”) agreed that PayPal’s management may designate up to 35% of
European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund European and U.S. credit activities. In August 2022, the CSSF approved
PayPal’s management designating up to 50% of such balances to fund our credit activities through the end of February 2023. During 2022, an additional $1.1
billion was approved to fund our credit activities. As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative amount approved by management to be designated to fund credit
activities aggregated to $3.8 billion and represented approximately 37% of European customer balances made available for our corporate use at that date, as
determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of European customer
balances for our credit activities, as we deem necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Under certain
exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances.
While our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful
in achieving that goal.
Customer protection programs
The risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual consumers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by
regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in
these consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rate ranged between 0.09% and 0.12% of TPV. Historical loss rates may not
be indicative of future results.
Stock repurchases
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately $4.2 billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase
program authorized in July 2018. In June 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of
up to $15.0 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. As of December 31, 2022, a total of approximately $861 million
and $15.0 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2018 and June 2022 stock repurchase programs, respectively.
For additional information, see “Note 14—Stock Repurchase Programs” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

Table of Contents
Future obligations
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately $4.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, of unused credit was available to PayPal Credit account holders
in the U.K. While this amount represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, that all of our PayPal Credit account
holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time. In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to
periodic review and termination based on, among other things, account usage and customer creditworthiness.
We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business
needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from our estimates. We cannot
provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2022 that are
expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment
portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations.

The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:
•Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for cloud computing services, advertising, and capital expenditures, and other
goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.
•Operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases (including leases not yet commenced) primarily
for office and data center facilities. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from
actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office
facility early.
•Transition tax represents the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Act.
•Long-term debt amounts represent the future principal and interest payments (based on contractual interest rates) on our fixed-rate debt. For more
information, see “Note 12—Debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table above does not include $1.9
billion of such non-current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.
Other considerations
Our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit
market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted
by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Note 13—Commitments and
Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional discussion of these and other risks that our business faces.

Table of Contents
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future
events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that
the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and
assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate or assumption is
considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact
within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Management has discussed the development,
selection, and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk, and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies,
including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated
financial statements included in this Form 10 -K.
A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated, and provides material information to
investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general directional cause and effect of changes in the
estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as
forecasted, and such estimates require regular review and adjustment.
ALLOWANCE FOR TRANSACTION AND CREDIT LOSSES
Transaction and credit losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit losses associated with our
loans receivable balances. Our transaction and credit losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including: total TPV, product mix, current and projected
macroeconomic conditions, merchant insolvency events, changes to and usage of our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the
credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products, which include revolving and installment credit products offered to
consumers at checkout, and merchant loans and advances arising from the PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products.
We establish allowances for negative customer balances and estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks
for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items, purchase protection
program claims, account takeovers, and Automated Clearing House returns. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction
and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss). The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including
experience with similar cases, historical trends involving collection and write-off patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types, as well as current and
projected macroeconomic factors, as appropriate.
We also establish an allowance for loans and interest receivable, which represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of
loans and interest receivable. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. The allowance is primarily based on expectations of
credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. The loss models incorporate various portfolio
attributes including geographic region, first borrowing versus repeat borrowing, delinquency, loan term, internally developed risk ratings, credit rating, and
vintage, which vary by portfolio. The loss models also incorporate macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in unemployment, retail e-commerce sales,
and household disposable income (and through the second quarter of 2022, benchmark credit card charge-off rates), which are sourced externally, using a
single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. Projected loss rates, inclusive of historical loss
data and macroeconomic factors, are applied to the principal amount of our merchant and consumer receivables. Our consumer receivables consist of revolving
products, which do not have a contractual term, and installment products. The reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving products, installment
products, and merchant products that we have included in our projected loss rates for 2022, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, is
approximately 2 years, approximately 7 months to 3.5 years, and approximately 2.5 to 3.5 years, respectively. In 2021, the reasonable and supportable forecast
periods were consistent with 2022 except for installment products, which had an estimated life of 7 months to 2.5 years. We also include qualitative
adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses. The allowance for current
expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period
of origination, among other factors.

Table of Contents
Determining appropriate current expected credit loss allowances for loans and interest receivable is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may
vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or
recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for current expected credit losses at the balance sheet
date after incorporating the impact of externally sourced macroeconomic forecasts. As of December 31, 2022, we utilized externally published projections of
the U.S. and U.K. forecasted unemployment rates, forecasted U.S. retail e-commerce sales, and forecasted U.K. household disposable income, among others,
over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. As of December 31, 2021, we utilized externally published projections of the U.S. and U.K. forecasted
unemployment rates over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The overall principal and interest coverage ratio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021
was approximately 7% and 9%, respectively. A significant change in the forecasted macroeconomic factors could result in a material change in our allowances.
Our allowance as of December 31, 2022 took into account uncertainty with respect to macroeconomic conditions, and uncertainty around the financial health of
our borrowers and effectiveness of loan modification programs made available to merchants. Our allowance as of December 31, 2021 took into account
continued volatility with respect to macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty around the financial health of our merchant borrowers, including uncertainty
around the effectiveness of loan modification programs made available to merchants. An increase of 1% in the principal and interest coverage ratio would
increase our allowances by approximately $80 million based on the loans and interest receivable balance outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES
Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in
determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the
balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to
local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S. through provisions such as the
GILTI tax and base erosion anti-abuse tax or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s
judgment about, and intentions concerning, our future operations.
Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate
the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of
taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are
based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. To the extent deferred tax assets are not
expected to be realized, we record a valuation allowance.
We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with U.S. GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the
position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50
percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. U.S. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions
be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income
tax expense.
We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by
the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax
position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest and penalties, where appropriate in
light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.
Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2022, a one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our
income tax expense of approximately $34 million.

Table of Contents
LOSS CONTINGENCIES
We are currently involved in various claims, regulatory and legal proceedings, and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight
authorities. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, legal
proceeding, or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss.
Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective and
are based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of
uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess
the potential liability related to pending claims, litigation, or other violations and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of legal and
regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may differ materially from the actual outcomes.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Application of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates.
Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting.
Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment.
Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants. Evaluating whether these incentives are a payment to a customer, or consideration
payable on behalf of a customer, requires judgment. Incentives determined to be made to a customer, or payable on behalf of a customer, are recorded as a
reduction to gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized.
VALUATION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES
The valuation of assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for
business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to
properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated or amortized and goodwill. Our estimates are based upon assumptions that
we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which do
not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.
EVALUATION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT
We have strategic investments in non-marketable equity securities, which include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and are
measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or
similar investment in the same issuer (the Measurement Alternative). We review these investments regularly to determine if impairment has occurred. We
assess whether an impairment loss on these non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies, has occurred based
on qualitative factors such as the companies’ financial condition and business outlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic or technological
environment, and other relevant events and factors affecting the company. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of these non-
marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach. If any impairment is identified, we write down the investment to its fair
value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Estimating fair value requires
judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity investment risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our
investing, funding, and foreign currency derivative activities intended to mitigate market risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis.
53
Table of Contents
INTEREST RATE RISK
We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our
consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 57% and 40%, respectively, of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investment portfolio (excluding
restricted cash and strategic investments) was held in cash and cash equivalents. The remaining portfolio and assets underlying the customer balances that we
hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, and available-
for-sale debt securities. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law
in certain jurisdictions where we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to
customers.
Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities and the fair value
of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our cash equivalents and
available-for-sale debt securities investment by approximately $161 million and $272 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in the fair
value of our available-for-sale debt securities resulting from such interest rate changes are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (“AOCI”) and are realized only if we sell the securities prior to their scheduled maturities or the declines in fair values are due to expected credit losses.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $10.4 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, in fixed rate debt with varying maturity dates. Since these notes bear
interest at fixed rates, they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes
fluctuates when interest rates change, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we also had revolving credit facilities of approximately $5.7 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, available to us. We are
obligated to pay interest on borrowings under these facilities as well as other customary fees, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on
our debt rating. Borrowings under these facilities, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuations in interest
rate to the extent of our borrowings. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had ¥64.3 billion (approximately $491 million) and ¥11.3 billion (approximately
$98 million), respectively, outstanding under these credit facilities. A 100 basis points hypothetical adverse change in applicable market interest rates would not
have resulted in a material impact to interest expense recorded in the period. For additional information, see “Note 12—Debt” in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest
rates often lead to larger payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us, or to lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and
merchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs,
and allowances for loans and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net income (loss).
FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK
We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian
dollar, which subject us to foreign currency exchange rate risk and may adversely impact our financial results. We transact in various foreign currencies and
have significant international revenues and costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and
for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations, and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related
hedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the United States (“U.S.”) dollar, and are
adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies. We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates
and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term.

We have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures, and
reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency
exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign currency
exchange contracts, please see “Note 10—Derivative Instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
We use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings and our investment in foreign subsidiaries from
adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign currency
exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenues denominated in foreign currencies and net investment
hedges for accounting purposes. The derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI. Cash flow hedges are subsequently reclassified into
revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The accumulated gains and losses associated with net investment hedges will remain in
AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings.
If the U.S. dollar weakened by a hypothetical 10% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange
forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $710 million and $512 million lower, respectively, before considering the offsetting impact of
the underlying hedged item.
We have an additional foreign currency exchange management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency
exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated
as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign
currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the
foreign currency exchange contracts.
Adverse changes in exchange rates of a hypothetical 10% for all foreign currencies would have resulted in a negative impact on income before income taxes of
approximately $173 million and $196 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, without considering the offsetting effect of foreign currency
exchange contracts. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2022 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by
approximately $144 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $29 million. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31,
2021 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $203 million, resulting in a net positive impact of approximately $7
million. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% were applied to monetary assets, monetary liabilities, and available-for-sale debt
securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these
changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.
EQUITY INVESTMENT RISK
Our strategic investments are subject to a variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of the portfolio. As of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, our strategic investments totaled $2.1 billion and $3.2 billion which represented approximately 14% and 20% of our total cash,
cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investment portfolio at each of those respective dates. Our strategic investments include marketable equity
securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies. We are required to
record all adjustments to the value of these strategic investments through our consolidated statements of income (loss). As such, we expect volatility to our net
income (loss) in future periods due to changes in fair value related to our investments in marketable equity securities and changes in observable prices related
to our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative. These changes could be material based on market conditions.
Additionally, the financial success of our investments in privately held companies is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering,
acquisition, private sale, or other favorable market event providing the ability to realize appreciation in the value of the investment. A hypothetical adverse
change of 10% in the carrying value of our strategic investments as of December 31, 2022, which could be experienced in the near term, would have resulted in
an incremental decrease of approximately $215 million to the carrying value of the portfolio. We review our non-marketable equity securities accounted for
under the Measurement Alternative for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value. Our
analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent purchases and sales of securities, and other publicly available data, for which we assess
factors such as the investees’ financial condition and business outlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic, or technological environment, and other
relevant events and factors affecting the investee.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the related consolidated statements of income (loss), of comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2022 listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also
have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the COSO.
Changes in Accounting Principles
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on financial
instruments in 2020. 
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements
and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Allowance for Loans Receivable
As described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded total loans and interest receivable of
$7,431 million, net of an allowance of $598 million. The allowance for loans receivable is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical
lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. The loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes, as well as
macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in unemployment, retail e-commerce sales, and household disposable income. The forecasted macroeconomic
factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario to reflect the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. Management also includes qualitative
adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the expected credit loss models.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loans receivable is a critical audit matter are (i) the
high degree of auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to certain models which apply macroeconomic
forecasts to estimate expected credit losses; and (ii) the audit effort involved in the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for loans receivable, including controls over
certain models which apply macroeconomic forecasts to estimate expected credit losses. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of
professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in testing management’s process for estimating the allowance for loans receivable. Testing
management’s process included (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology and certain models; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain
data used in the estimate; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s application of macroeconomic forecasts to estimate expected credit losses.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1—OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
OVERVIEW AND ORGANIZATION
PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading technology platform
that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing
financial services to help improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around
the world. Our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world in the markets we serve, anytime, on
any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid, including person-to-person payments.
We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments
industry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable
to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation.
New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions
related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely
and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of PayPal and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The noncontrolling interest reported in a prior period was a component of
equity on our consolidated balance sheets and represented the equity interests not owned by PayPal, and was recorded for consolidated entities we controlled
and of which we owned less than 100%. Noncontrolling interest was not presented separately on our consolidated statements of income (loss) as the amount
was de minimis.
Investments in entities where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method
of accounting. For such investments, our share of the investee’s results of operations is included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements
of income (loss). Investments in entities where we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for at fair value or
cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes, which are included in other income (expense), net on our
consolidated statements of income (loss). Our investment balance is included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.
We determine at the inception of each investment, and re-evaluate if certain events occur, whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered
a variable interest entity (“VIE”). If we determine an investment is in a VIE, we then assess if we are the primary beneficiary, which would require
consolidation.
As of December 31, 2021, we had consolidated two VIEs that provided financing for and held loans receivable of Paidy, Inc. (“Paidy”). We were the primary
beneficiary of the VIEs as we performed the servicing and collection for the loans receivable, which were the activities that most significantly impacted the
VIE’s economic performance, and we had the obligation to absorb the losses and/or the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be
significant to these entities. The financial results of these VIEs were included in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying
value of the assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs was included as short-term investments of $87 million, loans and interest receivable, net of $21
million, and long-term debt of $98 million. Cash of $87 million, included in short-term investments, was restricted to settle the debt obligations. In the first
quarter of 2022, we terminated Paidy’s legacy debt structure and replaced it with a new credit agreement executed in February 2022. As a result, we no longer
have any consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2022. See “Note 12—Debt” for additional information.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments in nonconsolidated VIEs was $128 million and $74 million,
respectively, and is included as non-marketable equity securities applying the equity method of accounting in long-term investments on our consolidated
balance sheets. Our maximum exposure to loss related to our nonconsolidated VIEs, which represents funded commitments and any future funding
commitments, was $232 million and $205 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are
necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to
conform to the financial statement presentation as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Reclassifications
Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2022, we reclassified certain cash flows related to our collateral security arrangements for derivative instruments from
cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities within the consolidated statements of cash
flows. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
The current period presentation classifies all changes in collateral posted and collateral received related to derivative instruments on our consolidated
statements of cash flows as cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities, respectively. We believe that the current period
presentation provides a more meaningful representation of the nature of the cash flows and allows for greater transparency as the cash flows related to the
derivatives impact operating cash flows upon settlement exclusive of the offsetting cash flows from collateral.
The following tables present the effects of the changes on the presentation of these cash flows to the previously reported consolidated statements of cash flows:

Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate
our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction and credit losses, income taxes, loss contingencies, revenue recognition, the valuation of
goodwill and intangible assets, and the valuation of strategic investments. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions which
we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and are comprised of
primarily bank deposits, government and agency securities, and commercial paper.
Investments
Short-term investments include time deposits and available-for-sale debt securities with original maturities of greater than three months but less than one year
when purchased or maturities of one year or less on the reporting date. Long-term investments include time deposits and available-for-sale debt securities with
maturities exceeding one year on the reporting date, as well as our strategic investments. Our available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value using
the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of related estimated tax
provisions or benefits.
 
We elect to account for available-for-sale debt securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, underlying funds
receivable and customer accounts, short-term investments, and long-term investments, under the fair value option as further discussed in “Note 9—Fair Value
Measurement of Assets and Liabilities.” The changes in fair value related to initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value are included in earnings
as a component of other income (expense), net.(1)

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Our strategic investments consist of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily
investments in privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income
(expense), net. Non-marketable equity securities include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, as well as equity method investments.
The investments that do not have readily determinable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the “Measurement Alternative”). Non-marketable
equity securities also include our investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee and account for
these securities using the equity method of accounting. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, and our share of earnings or losses
from investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss).
We assess whether an impairment loss on our non-marketable, measurement alternative investments has occurred based on qualitative factors such as the
companies’ financial condition and business outlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic or technological environment, and other relevant events and
factors affecting the company. We assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our equity method investments has occurred due to declines in
fair value or other market conditions. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities using the market
approach and/or the income approach. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market
data of comparable companies, among others. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities or impairment is considered other-than-
temporary for our equity method investments, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income
(expense), net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Our available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position are written down to fair
value through a charge to other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income (loss) if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than
not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. For the remaining available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss
position, if we identify that the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses, taking into consideration changes to the rating of the security by rating
agencies, implied yields versus benchmark yields, and the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, among other factors, we estimate the present
value of cash flows expected to be collected. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists
and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any portion of impairment not
related to credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).
Loans and interest receivable, net
Loans and interest receivable, net represents merchant receivables originated under our PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) product and PayPal Business Loan
(“PPBL”) product and consumer loans originated under our PayPal Credit and installment credit products. PayPal Credit consists of revolving credit products.
In the U.S., PPWC, PPBL, and consumer interest-bearing installment products are provided under a program agreement we have with an independent chartered
financial institution (“partner institution”). The partner institution extends credit to merchants for the PPWC and PPBL products and to consumers for interest-
bearing installment products and we purchase the related receivables originated by the partner institution. For our merchant finance products outside the U.S.,
we extend working capital advances and loans in Europe through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary, and working capital loans in Australia through an
Australian subsidiary. In the U.S., we extend certain short-term, interest-free, installment loans to consumers through a U.S. subsidiary. For our international
consumer credit products, we extend credit in Europe through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary, and in Australia and Japan, through local subsidiaries.
As part of our arrangement with the partner institution in the U.S., we sell back a participation interest in the pool of receivables for the PPWC, PPBL, and
consumer interest-bearing installment products. The partner institution has no recourse against us related to their participation interests for failure of debtors to
pay when due. The participation interests held by the partner institution have the same priority to the interests held by us and are subject to the same credit,
prepayment, and interest rate risk associated with this pool of receivables. All risks of loss are shared pro rata based on participation interests held among all
participating stakeholders. We account for the asset transfer as a sale and derecognize the portion of the participation interests for which control has been
surrendered. For this arrangement, gains or losses on the sale of the participation interests are not material as the carrying amount of the participation interest
sold approximates the fair value at time of transfer.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
In certain instances where a merchant is able to demonstrate that it is experiencing financial difficulty, there may be a modification of the loan or advance and
the related interest or fee receivable for which it is probable that, without modification, we would be unable to collect all amounts due, therefore resulting in a
troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”). Refer to “Note 11—Loans and Interest Receivable” for further information related to TDRs.
Loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable are reported at their outstanding balances, net of any participation interests sold and unamortized deferred
origination costs. We maintain the servicing rights for the entire pool of consumer and merchant receivables outstanding and receive a market-based service fee
for servicing the assets underlying the participation interest sold.
We offer both revolving and installment credit products to our consumers. The terms of our consumer relationships require us to submit monthly bills to the
consumer detailing loan repayment requirements. The terms also allow us to charge the consumer interest and fees in certain circumstances. Due to the
relatively small dollar amount of individual loans and interest receivable, we do not require collateral on these balances.
Another partner institution is the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit consumer financing program in the U.S. We do not hold an ownership interest in the
receivables generated through the program and therefore, do not record these receivables on our consolidated financial statements. PayPal earns a revenue
share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by the partner institution, which is recorded in revenues from other value added services on our
consolidated statements of income (loss).
Allowance for loans and interest receivable
The allowance for loans and interest receivable represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest
receivables. Increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as a component of transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of
income (loss). Increases to the allowance for interest and fees receivable are reflected as a reduction of net revenues on our consolidated statements of income
(loss), or as a reduction of deferred revenue when interest and fees are billed at the inception of a loan or advance. The evaluation process to assess the
adequacy of allowances is subject to numerous estimates and judgments.
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments (“CECL”) effective January 1, 2020.
The allowance for merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss
data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. In the third quarter of 2022, our expected credit loss models for our merchant receivables
were updated. These changes did not have a material impact on our provision recorded in the year ended December 31, 2022. The merchant loss models
incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, first borrowing versus repeat borrowing, delinquency, internally developed risk ratings,
and vintage, as well as macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in unemployment and retail e-commerce sales (and through the second quarter of
2022, benchmark credit card charge-off rates.) The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most
appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. The reasonable and supportable forecast period for merchant products that we have
included in our projected loss rates for 2022 and 2021, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, is approximately 2.5 to 3.5 years. Projected loss
rates, inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factors, are applied to the principal amount of our merchant receivables. We also include qualitative
adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses. The allowance for current
expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period
of origination, among other factors.

The allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data. The
allowance for loans and interest receivable for our revolving credit product also incorporates macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. The consumer
loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, loan term, delinquency, credit rating, vintage, and for the revolving credit
portfolio macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in unemployment and household disposable income. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are
sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. The reasonable and
supportable forecast period for revolving products and installment products that we have included in our projected loss rates for 2022, which approximates the
estimated life of the loans, is approximately 2 years and approximately 7 months to 3.5 years, respectively. In 2021, the reasonable and supportable forecast
periods were consistent with 2022 except for installment products, which had an estimated life of 7 months to 2.5 years. Projected loss rates, inclusive of
historical loss data and, for the revolving credit portfolio macroeconomic factors, are derived based on and applied to the principal amount of our consumer
receivables. We also include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected
credit losses, such as expectations of macroeconomic conditions not captured in the loss models for our installment products. The allowance for current
expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period
of origination, among other factors.
Customer accounts
We hold all customer balances, both in the U.S. and internationally, as direct claims against us which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a
liability classified as amounts due to customers. Certain jurisdictions where PayPal operates require us to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable
regulatory requirements and commercial law in these jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. Therefore, we
restrict the use of the assets underlying the customer balances to meet these regulatory requirements and separately classify the assets as customer accounts in
our consolidated balance sheets. We classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct
obligation under amounts due to customers. Customer funds for which PayPal is an agent and custodian on behalf of our customers are not reflected on our
consolidated balance sheets. These funds include U.S. dollar funds which are deposited at one or more third-party financial institutions insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance (subject to applicable limits).
Under applicable accounting standards, we are an agent when facilitating cryptocurrency transactions on behalf of our customers. Cryptocurrencies held on
behalf of our customers are not PayPal’s assets and therefore, are not reflected as cryptocurrency assets on our consolidated balance sheets; however, we
recognize a crypto asset safeguarding liability with a corresponding safeguarding asset to reflect our obligation to safeguard the cryptocurrencies held on behalf
of our customers.
In June 2018, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”) agreed that PayPal’s management may designate up to 35% of
European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund European and U.S. credit activities. In August 2022, the CSSF approved
PayPal’s management designating up to 50% of such balances to fund our credit activities through the end of February 2023. During the year ended
December 31, 2022, an additional $1.1 billion was approved to fund our credit activities. As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative amount approved by
management to be designated to fund credit activities aggregated to $3.8 billion and represented approximately 37% of European customer balances made
available for our corporate use at that date as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. At the time PayPal’s management
designates the European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit, the balances are classified as cash and cash
equivalents and no longer classified as customer accounts on our consolidated balance sheets. The remaining assets underlying the customer balances remain
separately classified as customer accounts on our consolidated balance sheets. We identify these customer accounts separately from corporate funds and
maintain them in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities. Customer balances deposited with our
partners on a short-term basis in advance of customer transactions and used to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers are classified as cash
and cash equivalents within our customer accounts classification on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 8—Funds Receivable and Customer Accounts
and Investments” for additional information related to customer accounts.
We present changes in funds receivable and customer accounts as cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the
nature of the activity underlying our customer accounts.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Funds receivable and funds payable
Funds receivable and funds payable arise due to the time required to initiate collection from and clear transactions through external payment networks. When
customers fund their PayPal account using their bank account, credit card, debit card, or withdraw funds from their PayPal account to their bank account or
through a debit card transaction, there is a clearing period before the cash is received or settled, usually one to three business days for U.S. transactions and
generally up to five business days for international transactions. In addition, a portion of our customers’ funds are settled directly to their bank account. These
funds are also classified as funds receivable and funds payable and arise due to the time required to initiate collection from and clear transactions through
external payment networks.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment consists primarily of computer equipment, software and website development costs, land and buildings, leasehold improvements, and
furniture and fixtures. Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets; generally, one to four years for computer equipment and software,
including capitalized software and website development costs, three years for furniture and fixtures, up to 30 years for buildings and building improvements,
and the shorter of five years or the non-cancelable term of the lease for leasehold improvements.
Direct costs incurred to develop software for internal use and website development costs, including those costs incurred in expanding and enhancing our
payments platform, are capitalized and amortized generally over an estimated useful life of three years and are recorded as amortization within the financial
statement captions aligned with the internal organizations that are the primary beneficiaries of such assets. We capitalized $511 million and $462 million of
internally developed software and website development costs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense for these
capitalized costs was $426 million, $366 million, and $322 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Costs related to the
maintenance of internal use software and website development costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
We determine whether an arrangement is a lease for accounting purposes at contract inception. Operating leases are recorded as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets,
which are included in other assets, and lease liabilities, which are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and deferred tax liability and other
long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. For sale-leaseback transactions, we evaluate the sale and the lease arrangement based on our
conclusion as to whether control of the underlying asset has been transferred, and recognize the sale-leaseback as either a sale transaction or under the
financing method. The financing method requires the asset to remain on our consolidated balance sheets throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds to be
recognized as a financing obligation.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from
the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Our
leases do not provide an implicit rate and therefore we use an incremental borrowing rate for specific terms on a collateralized basis using information available
on the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset calculation includes lease payments to be made and excludes
lease incentives. The ROU asset and lease liability may include amounts attributed to options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain we
will exercise that option. When we reach a decision to exercise a lease renewal or termination option, we recognize the associated impact to the ROU asset and
lease liability. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We evaluate ROU assets related to leases for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
ROU asset may not be recoverable. When a decision has been made to exit a lease prior to the contractual term or to sublease that space, we evaluate the asset
for impairment and recognize the associated impact to the ROU asset and related expense, if applicable. The evaluation is performed at the asset group level
initially and when appropriate, at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual lease level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by the related ROU assets are estimated over the ROU assets’ useful lives. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the ROU assets may
not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related ROU asset or asset group as determined by appropriate
valuation techniques.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. We have elected to apply the practical expedient and account for the lease and non-lease
components as a single lease component for all leases, where applicable. In addition, we have elected to apply the practical expedients related to lease
classification, hindsight, and land easement. We apply a single portfolio approach to account for the ROU assets and lease liabilities.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill is tested for impairment, at a minimum, on an annual basis at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine
whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative
assessment, then the reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit
exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the reporting unit may be estimated using income and market approaches. The discounted cash flow method, a form of
the income approach, uses expected future operating results and a market participant discount rate. The market approach uses comparable company prices and
other relevant information generated by market transactions (either publicly traded entities or mergers and acquisitions) to develop pricing metrics to be applied
to historical and expected future operating results of the reporting unit. Failure to achieve these expected results, changes in the discount rate, or market pricing
metrics may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2022 and
2021. We determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill of our reporting unit was required. As of December 31, 2022, we determined that no
events occurred, or circumstances changed from August 31, 2022 through December 31, 2022 that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the
reporting unit below its carrying amount.
Intangible assets consist of acquired customer list and user base intangible assets, marketing related intangibles, developed technology, and other intangible
assets. Intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from two to seven
years. No significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets.
Impairment of long-lived assets
We evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a
long-lived asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow the asset is expected
to generate.
Allowance for transaction losses
We are exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other payment misuse as well as nonperformance from sellers who accept payments through PayPal.
We establish an allowance for estimated losses arising from completing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and
merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items, purchase protection program claims, and account takeovers.
This allowance represents an accumulation of the estimated amounts of probable transaction losses as of the reporting date, including those which we have not
yet identified. The allowance is monitored regularly and is updated based on actual loss data. The allowance is based on known facts and circumstances,
internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types, as
applicable. Additions to the allowance are reflected as a component of transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss). The
allowance for transaction losses is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

Allowance for negative customer balances
Negative customer balances occur primarily when there are insufficient funds in a customer’s PayPal account to cover charges applied for Automated Clearing
House returns, debit card transactions, and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items, which are generally
within the scope of our protection programs. Negative customer balances can be cured by the customer by adding funds to their account, receiving payments,
or through back-up funding sources. We also utilize third-party collection agencies. For negative customer balances that are not expected to be cured or
otherwise collected, we provide an allowance for expected losses. The allowance represents expected losses based on historical trends involving collection and
write-off patterns, internal factors including our experience with similar cases, other known facts and circumstances, and reasonable and supportable
macroeconomic forecasts, as applicable. Loss rates are derived using historical loss data for each delinquency bucket using a roll rate model that captures the
losses and the likelihood that a negative customer balance will be written off as the delinquency age of such balance increases. The loss rates are then applied
to the outstanding negative customer balances. Once the quantitative calculation is performed, we review the adequacy of the allowance and determine if
qualitative adjustments need to be considered. We write-off negative customer balances in the month in which the balance becomes outstanding for 120 days.
Write-offs that are recovered are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for negative customer balances. Negative customer balances are included in other
current assets, net of the allowance on our consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments to the allowance for negative customer balances are recorded as a
component of transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss).

Fair value measurements
We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis and certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a
non-recurring basis when a change in fair value or impairment is evidenced. Fair value is defined as the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in the principal market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value is estimated
by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The categorization within the following three-level fair value
hierarchy for our recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements is based upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value
measurement:
•Level 1 - Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are
not active or other inputs that are observable or can be market-corroborated.
•Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that cannot be directly corroborated by observable market data and that typically reflect management’s estimate of
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
See “Note 9—Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities” for additional information related to our fair value measurements.

Concentrations of risk
Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, loans and interest receivable, net, funds receivable and customer accounts, long-term
investments, and long-term notes receivable, are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash, cash equivalents, and customer accounts are placed
with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. In addition, funds receivable are generated primarily with financial institutions
which management believes are of high credit quality. We invest our cash, cash equivalents, and customer accounts primarily in highly liquid, highly rated
instruments which are uninsured. We have corporate deposit balances with financial services institutions which exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000.
As part of our cash management process, we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. Our accounts receivable
are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the U.S. and internationally. Our loans and interest receivable are derived from merchant and
consumer financing activities for customers located in the U.S. and internationally. Our long-term notes receivable is derived from deferred proceeds associated
with the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to a partner institution in 2018. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, one customer accounted for
20% and 25% of net accounts receivables, respectively. No customer accounted for more than 10% of net loans receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, one partner institution accounted for our long-term notes receivable balance, which represented 18% and 22% of other assets,
respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, no customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues. During the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we earned approximately 2%, 6%, and 13% of revenue, respectively, from customers on eBay’s Marketplaces platform.
No other source of revenue represented more than 10% of our revenue.
Revenue recognition
See “Note 2—Revenue” for information related to our revenue recognition.
Advertising expense
We expense the cost of producing advertisements at the time production occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements in the period during
which the advertising space or airtime is used as sales and marketing expense. Online advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of the individual
agreements, which are generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of impressions delivered over the total number of contracted impressions, on a pay-
per-click basis, or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Advertising expense totaled $518 million, $740 million, and $654 million for the years
ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Defined contribution savings plans
We have a defined contribution savings plan in the U.S. which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”). Our non-U.S. employees
are covered by other savings plans. Expenses related to our defined contribution savings plans are recorded when services are rendered by our employees.
Stock-based compensation
We determine compensation expense associated with restricted stock units, performance based restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards based on the
estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We determine compensation expense associated with stock options based on the estimated grant
date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We generally recognize compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method over
the respective vesting period for awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021, and 2020 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behavior of our employees as
well as trends of actual forfeitures.

Foreign currency
Many of our foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency of their respective countries as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of our non-
U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses of
our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using daily exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from these
translations are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”). Gains and losses from the remeasurement of foreign
currency transactions into the functional currency are recognized as other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income (loss).
Income taxes
We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and
deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. The
measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are
not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized based on
available evidence. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We
recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We account for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income as a
current-period expense when incurred.
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net includes: (i) interest income, which consists of interest earned on corporate cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-
term investments, (ii) interest expense, which consists of interest expense, fees, and amortization of debt discount on our long-term debt (including current
portion) and credit facilities, (iii) realized and unrealized gains (losses) on strategic investments, which includes changes in fair value related to our marketable
equity securities and observable price changes and impairments on our non-marketable equity securities, and (iv) other, which primarily includes foreign
currency exchange gains and losses due to remeasurement of certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, and fair value changes on
the derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments.
Recent accounting guidance
In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”) and Vintage Disclosures
(Topic 326): Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. This amended guidance will eliminate the accounting designation of a loan modification as a TDR,
including eliminating the measurement guidance for TDRs. The amendments also enhance existing disclosure requirements and introduce new requirements
related to modifications of receivables due from borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, this guidance requires entities to disclose gross write-
offs by year of origination for financing receivables, such as loans and interest receivable. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2022 and is required to be applied prospectively, except for the recognition and measurement of TDRs, which can be applied on a modified
retrospective basis. We have concluded that our financial statements were not materially impacted upon adoption. We adopted this guidance effective January
1, 2023 on a prospective basis and will provide additional disclosures as required.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Recently adopted accounting guidance
In March 2022, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (“SAB 121”), which provides guidance for an entity to consider when it has obligations to
safeguard customers’ crypto assets, whether directly or through an agent or another third party acting on its behalf. The interpretive guidance requires a
reporting entity to record a liability to reflect its obligation to safeguard the crypto assets held for its platform users with a corresponding safeguarding asset.
The crypto asset safeguarding liability and the corresponding safeguarding asset will be measured at the fair value of the crypto assets held for the platform
users with the measurement of the safeguarding asset taking into account any potential loss events. SAB 121 also requires disclosures related to the entity’s
safeguarding obligations for crypto assets held for its platform users. SAB 121 was effective in the first interim or annual financial statements ending after June
15, 2022 with retrospective application as of the beginning of the fiscal year. We adopted this guidance for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 with retrospective
application as of January 1, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, we recorded $596 million for both the crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding
safeguarding asset, which were classified as accrued expenses and other current liabilities and prepaid expenses and other current assets, respectively, on our
condensed consolidated balance sheet. For additional information, see “Note 7—Other Financial Statement Details.”
There are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these new
accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
NOTE 2—REVENUE
We enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers on our payments
platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into two categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added
services.
TRANSACTION REVENUES
We earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a fixed and variable
component. The variable component is generally a percentage of the value of the payment amount and is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a
portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement when the underlying transaction is approved for a refund. We
estimate the amount of fee refunds that will be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity
processed on our payments platform, which results in transaction revenue, is referred to as Total Payment Volume (“TPV”). We earn additional fees from
merchants and consumers on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the
merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank
account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for
example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our
customers.
Our contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed.
Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already provided. Our contracts generally renew
automatically without any significant material rights. Some of our contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per
transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes. We have concluded that this
volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with
similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs and we do not carry any material contract balances.
Our primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using our risk assessment
tools, we perform a transaction risk assessment on individual transactions to determine whether a transaction should be authorized for completion on our
payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.
78
Table of Contents
PayPal Holdings, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of completing a payment
transaction. As a principal to the transaction, we control the service of completing payments on our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the
fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services.
Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize
payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment
transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing
customer support.
To promote engagement and acquire new users on our platform, we may provide incentives to merchants and consumers in various forms including discounts
on fees, rebates, rewards, and coupons. Evaluating whether an incentive is a payment to a customer requires judgment. Incentives that are determined to be
consideration payable to a customer or paid on behalf of a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue. Certain incentives paid to users that are not our
customers are classified as sales and marketing expense.
We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain transactions completed on our payments platform. These programs are intended to
protect both merchants and consumers from loss primarily due to fraud and counterparty performance. These protection programs do not provide a separate
service to our customers and we estimate and record associated costs in transaction and credit losses during the period the payment transaction is completed.
REVENUES FROM OTHER VALUE ADDED SERVICES
We earn revenues from other value added services, which are comprised primarily of revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees,
gateway fees, and other services that we provide to our merchants and consumers. These contracts typically have one performance obligation which is provided
and recognized over the term of the contract. The transaction price is generally fixed and known at the end of each reporting period; however, for some
agreements, it may be necessary to estimate the transaction price using the expected value method. Revenue earned from other value added services is recorded
on a net basis when we are considered the agent with respect to processing transactions.
We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.
Interest and fees earned on the portfolio of loans receivable are computed and recognized based on the effective interest method and are presented net of any
required reserves and amortization of deferred origination costs.
DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE
We determine operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, makes operating decisions around the
allocation of resources, and evaluates operating performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who regularly reviews our operating results on a
consolidated basis. We operate as one segment and have one reportable segment. Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we
believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately
depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services).
Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue
recognition models are substantially the same.

scope of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from contracts with customers. Such revenues relate to interest and fees earned on loans and interest receivable, as well as hedging
gains or losses, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.
Net revenues are attributed to the country in which the party paying our PayPal fee is located.
NOTE 3—NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding equity incentive awards is reflected in
diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all anti-dilutive
common shares. During periods when we report net loss, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share because the effects of potentially
dilutive items would decrease the net loss per share.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods indicated:

NOTE 4—BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
There were no acquisitions accounted for as business combinations or divestitures completed in 2022.
ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2021
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed five acquisitions reflecting 100% of the equity interests of the acquired companies, for an aggregate
purchase price of $3.1 billion.
Paidy
We completed the acquisition of Paidy in October 2021 by acquiring all outstanding shares for total consideration of approximately $2.7 billion, consisting of
approximately $2.6 billion in cash and approximately $161 million in assumed restricted stock and restricted stock units, subject to vesting conditions. Paidy is
a two-sided payments platform that primarily provides buy now, pay later solutions (installment credit offerings) in Japan. With the acquisition of Paidy, we
expanded our capabilities and relevance in Japan.
The following table summarizes the final allocation of the purchase consideration to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed:
(In millions)
Goodwill $ 1,897 
Customer lists and user base 512 
Marketing related 83 
Developed technology 47 
Total intangibles $ 642 
Loans and interest receivable, net 197 
Cash and cash equivalents 102 
Other net assets 87 
Short-term and long-term debt (188)
Deferred tax liabilities, net (166)
Total purchase price $ 2,571 
The intangible assets acquired consist primarily of merchant contracts, trade names/trademarks, and developed technology with estimated useful lives of three
to seven years. Contractual gross loans and interest receivable acquired were $216 million. We expect to collect substantially all of these receivables. The
excess of the purchase consideration, including the fair value of our equity investment, over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets
acquired was recorded as goodwill and is attributable to the workforce of Paidy and the synergies expected to arise from the acquisition, including continued
customer acquisition. Goodwill was not deductible for income tax purposes.
In connection with the acquisition, we issued restricted stock and restricted stock units with an approximate grant date fair value of $161 million, which
represents post-business combination expense. The equity granted is a combination of shares issued to certain former Paidy employees subject to a holdback
arrangement and assumed Paidy employee equity grants, which vest over a period of up to approximately four years subject to continued employment.

Other acquisitions
In 2021, we completed four other acquisitions accounted for as business combinations. The total purchase price for these acquisitions was $542 million,
consisting primarily of cash consideration. The allocation of purchase consideration resulted in approximately $90 million of technology, customer, and
marketing-related intangible assets with estimated useful lives ranging from approximately one to seven years, net assets of $17 million, and goodwill of
approximately $435 million attributable to the workforce of the acquired companies and the synergies expected to arise from these acquisitions, including the
integration of the acquired technology with our existing product offerings. Goodwill was not considered deductible for income tax purposes.
ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2020
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed one acquisition reflecting 100% of the equity interests of the acquired company, for a purchase price
of $3.6 billion.
Honey Science Corporation
We completed our acquisition of Honey Science Corporation (“Honey”) in January 2020 by acquiring all outstanding shares for total consideration of
approximately $4.0 billion, consisting of approximately $3.6 billion in cash and approximately $400 million in assumed restricted stock, restricted stock units,
and stock options, subject to vesting conditions. Honey was acquired to enhance our value proposition by allowing us to further simplify and personalize
shopping experiences for consumers while driving conversion and increasing consumer engagement and sales for merchants.

Total intangibles $ 717 
Accounts receivable, net 50 
Deferred tax liabilities, net (58)
Other net liabilities (36)
Total purchase price $ 3,635 
The intangible assets acquired consist primarily of customer contracts, trade name/trademarks, and developed technology with estimated useful lives of three
years. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill and is
attributable to the workforce of Honey and the synergies expected to arise from the acquisition through continued customer acquisition, cross selling initiatives,
and product enhancements. Goodwill was not deductible for income tax purposes.
In connection with the acquisition, we assumed restricted stock, restricted stock units, and options with an approximate grant date fair value of $400 million,
which represents post-business combination expense. The equity granted was a combination of shares issued to certain former Honey employees subject to a
holdback arrangement and assumed Honey employee grants, which vest over a period of up to four years and are subject to continued employment.

OTHER INFORMATION
Prior to acquisition, we held minority interests in certain of the companies we acquired in 2021. We remeasured these investments immediately before the
completion of the respective acquisitions at a total acquisition-date fair value of $64 million, which resulted in an aggregate gain of $36 million recognized as
other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income (loss). The acquisition-date fair value was derived using the value paid less a control
premium based on market analysis performed by a third party.

NOTE 6—LEASES
PayPal enters into various leases, which are primarily real estate operating leases. We use these properties for executive and administrative offices, data centers,
product development offices, customer services and operations centers, and warehouses.
While a majority of our lease agreements do not contain an explicit interest rate, certain of our lease agreements are subject to changes based on the Consumer
Price Index or another referenced index. In the event of changes to the relevant index, lease liabilities are not remeasured and instead are treated as variable
lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.
The short-term lease exemption has been adopted for all leases with a duration of less than 12 months.
PayPal’s lease portfolio includes a small number of subleases. A sublease situation can arise when currently leased real estate space is available and is surplus
to operational requirements.
As of December 31, 2022, we had no finance leases.

Operating lease amounts include minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases primarily for office and data center facilities. The
amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases. We recognize
rent expense under such agreements on a straight-line basis. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 totaled $202 million, $192
million, and $172 million, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2020, we entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement as the seller-lessee for a data center as the buyer-lessor obtained control of the facility.
We sold the data center and simultaneously entered into an operating lease agreement with the purchaser for the right to use the facility for 8 years. The
Company received proceeds of approximately $119 million, net of selling costs, which resulted in a de minimis net gain on the sale transaction.
In the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred asset impairment charges of $81 million, $26 million, and $30 million, respectively, within
restructuring and other charges on our consolidated statements of income (loss). The impairments included a reduction to our ROU lease assets in the amount
of $52 million, $21 million, and $23 million, respectively, which were attributed to certain leased space we are no longer utilizing for our business operations, a
portion of which is being subleased.
As of December 31, 2022, we entered into an additional operating lease for real estate, which will commence in the second quarter of 2023 or later with

CRYPTO ASSET SAFEGUARDING LIABILITY AND CORRESPONDING SAFEGUARDING ASSET
We allow our customers in certain markets to buy, hold, sell, receive, and send certain cryptocurrencies as well as use the proceeds from sales of
cryptocurrencies to pay for purchases at checkout. These cryptocurrencies consist of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin (collectively,“our
customers’ crypto assets”). We engage third parties, which are licensed trust companies, to provide certain custodial services, including holding our customers’
cryptographic key information, securing our customers’ crypto assets, and protecting them from loss or theft, including indemnification against certain types of
losses such as theft. Our third-party custodian holds the crypto assets in a custodial account in PayPal’s name for the benefit of PayPal’s customers. We
maintain the internal recordkeeping of our customers’ crypto assets, including the amount and type of crypto asset owned by each of our customers in that
custodial account. Given that we currently utilize one third-party custodian, there is concentration risk in the event the custodian is not able to perform in
accordance with our agreement.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Due to the unique risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including technological, legal, and regulatory risks, we recognize a crypto asset safeguarding liability
to reflect our obligation to safeguard the crypto assets held for the benefit of our customers, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities
on our consolidated balance sheet. We also recognize a corresponding safeguarding asset which is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our
consolidated balance sheet. The crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis using prices available in the market we determine to be the principal market at the balance sheet date. The corresponding safeguarding asset may be
adjusted for loss events, as applicable. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not incurred any safeguarding loss events, and therefore, the crypto asset
safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset were recorded at the same value. The following table summarizes the significant crypto assets we
hold for the benefit of our customers and the crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset as of December 31, 2022 (in millions):

Our non-marketable equity securities are recorded in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had
non-marketable equity securities of $136 million and $79 million, respectively, where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over
the investee. We account for these equity securities using the equity method of accounting. The remaining non-marketable equity securities do not have a
readily determinable fair value and we measure these equity investments at cost minus impairment, if any, and adjust for changes resulting from observable
price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and
unrealized, and our share of earnings or losses from investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized in other income (expense), net on our
consolidated statements of income (loss). The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities totaled $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31,

Our marketable equity securities are valued using quoted prices for identical assets in active markets (Level 1). There are no active markets for our crypto asset
safeguarding liability or the corresponding safeguarding asset. Accordingly, we have valued the asset and liability using quoted prices on the active exchange
that has been identified as the principal market for the underlying crypto assets (Level 2). All other financial assets and liabilities are valued using quoted prices
for identical instruments in less active markets, readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, or models using market observable inputs (Level
2).
A majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputs where applicable,
such as currency rates, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, and equity prices. Our derivative instruments are primarily short-term in nature, generally
one month to one year in duration. Certain foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges may have a duration of up to 18 months.(1)

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We measure the non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative at cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for observable
price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured
during the period based on observable price changes are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value based on
valuation methods which only include significant inputs that are observable, such as the observable transaction price at the transaction date. The fair value of
non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3 as we estimate fair value using significant
unobservable inputs such as discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others.
We evaluate ROU assets related to leases for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
ROU asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses on ROU lease assets related to office operating leases are calculated initially using estimated rental
income per square foot derived from observable market data, and the impaired asset is classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE
Our financial instruments, including cash, restricted cash, time deposits, loans and interest receivable, net, certain customer accounts, and long-term debt
related to borrowings on our credit facilities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value. Our notes receivable had a carrying value of
approximately $441 million and fair value of approximately $396 million as of December 31, 2022. Our notes receivable had a carrying value of approximately
$381 million and fair value of approximately $424 million as of December 31, 2021. Our long-term debt (including current portion) in the form of fixed rate
notes had a carrying value of approximately $10.3 billion and fair value of approximately $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. Our fixed rate notes had a
carrying value of approximately $9.0 billion and fair value of approximately $9.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. If these financial instruments were
measured at fair value in the financial statements, cash would be classified as Level 1; restricted cash, time deposits, certain customer accounts, and long-term
debt (including current portion) would be classified as Level 2; and the remaining financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy.
NOTE 10—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
SUMMARY OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that our counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek to mitigate such risk
by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions and by entering into collateral security arrangements. In addition,
the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not use any derivative
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Cash flow hedges
We have significant international revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies, which subjects us to foreign currency exchange risk. We have a foreign
currency exposure management program in which we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts, generally with maturities of 18 months or less, to
reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenues denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of these foreign currency exchange
contracts is to help mitigate the risk that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are adversely affected by changes in the applicable U.S. dollar/foreign currency
exchange rate. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a
component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. We evaluate the effectiveness of
our foreign currency exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by comparing the critical terms of the derivative instruments with the critical terms of the
forecasted cash flows of the hedged item; if the critical terms are the same, we conclude the hedge will be perfectly effective. We do not exclude any
component of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We report cash flows arising from derivative
instruments consistent with the classification of cash flows from the underlying hedged items that these derivatives are hedging. Accordingly, the cash flows
associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are classified in cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
As of December 31, 2022, we estimated that $110 million of net derivative gains related to our cash flow hedges included in AOCI are expected to be
reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges
because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur and as such, did not reclassify any gains or losses to earnings prior to the
occurrence of the hedged transaction. If we elect to discontinue our cash flow hedges and it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur, we
continue to report the derivative’s gain or loss in AOCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings, at which point we also reclassify it into earnings. Gains
and losses on derivatives held after we discontinue our cash flow hedges and on derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded
in the same financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.
Net investment hedges
We use forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk related to our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries.
These derivatives are designated as net investment hedges and accordingly, the gains and losses on the portion of the derivatives included in the assessment of
hedge effectiveness is recorded in AOCI as part of foreign currency translation. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and
recognize them in other income (expense), net on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. The accumulated gains and losses associated with these
instruments will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings. The
cash flows associated with derivatives designated as a net investment hedge are classified in cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements
of cash flows.
We have not reclassified any gains or losses related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings during any of the periods presented.
Foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments
We have a foreign currency exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange risk
of our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging
instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The gains and
losses due to remeasurement of certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are
offset by the gains and losses on these foreign currency exchange contracts. The cash flows associated with our non-designated derivatives used to hedge
foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are classified in cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

NOTE 11—LOANS AND INTEREST RECEIVABLE
CONSUMER RECEIVABLES
We offer revolving and installment credit products as a funding option for consumers in certain checkout transactions on our payments platform. Our revolving
credit product consists of PayPal Credit in the U.K. Once a consumer is approved for credit, it is made available to them as a funding source in their PayPal
wallet. Additionally, we offer installment credit products at the time of checkout in various markets, including the U.S., several markets across Europe,
Australia, and Japan. The majority of the installment loans allow consumers to pay for purchases over periods of 12 months or less. Beginning in June 2022,
we purchase receivables related to interest-bearing installment loans extended to U.S. consumers by a partner institution and are responsible for servicing
functions related to that portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased approximately $381 million in consumer receivables. As of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding balance of consumer receivables, which consisted of revolving and installment loans and interest receivable, was
$5.9 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, net of the participation interest sold to the partner institution of $17 million and nil, respectively. See “Note 1—
Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information on this participation arrangement.
We closely monitor the credit quality of our consumer receivables to evaluate and manage our related exposure to credit risk. Credit risk management begins
with initial underwriting and continues through the full repayment of a loan. To assess a consumer who requests a loan, we use, among other indicators,
internally developed risk models using detailed information from external sources, such as credit bureaus where available, and internal data, including the
consumer’s prior repayment history with our credit products where available. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making (or, for interest-bearing
installment loans in the U.S., to assist the partner institution in making) new and ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our models, to plan our collection practices
and strategies, and in determining our allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
The provision for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to growth in the consumer receivable portfolio. Qualitative adjustments were
made to account for limitations in our current expected credit loss models due to uncertainty with respect to macroeconomic conditions and the financial health
of our borrowers.
The increase in charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year was due to the expansion of our short-term
installment products.
The provision for current expected credit losses relating to our consumer receivable portfolio is recognized in transaction and credit losses on our consolidated
statements of income (loss). The provision for interest receivable for interest earned on our consumer receivable portfolio is recognized in revenues from other
value added services as a reduction to revenue. Loans receivable continue to accrue interest until they are charged off.
We charge off consumer receivable balances in the month in which a customer’s balance becomes 180 days past the billing date or contractual repayment date,
except for the U.S. consumer interest-bearing installment receivables, which are charged off 120 days past the contractual repayment date. Bankrupt accounts
are charged off within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest
receivable and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for loans and interest receivable.
MERCHANT RECEIVABLES
We offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses through our PPWC and PPBL products, which we collectively
refer to as our merchant finance offerings. We purchase receivables related to credit extended to U.S. merchants by a partner institution and are responsible for
servicing functions related to that portfolio. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we purchased approximately $3.2 billion and $1.8 billion in
merchant receivables, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total outstanding balance in our pool of merchant loans, advances, and interest and
fees receivable was $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, net of the participation interest sold to the partner institution of $97 million and $63 million,
respectively. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information on this participation arrangement.
Through our PPWC product, merchants can borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal and are charged a fixed fee for
the loan or advance based on the overall credit assessment of the merchant. Loans and advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the merchant’s future
payment volume that PayPal processes. Through our PPBL product, we provide merchants access to short-term business financing for a fixed fee based on an
evaluation of the applying business as well as the business owner. PPBL repayments are collected through periodic payments until the balance has been
satisfied.
The interest or fee is fixed at the time the loan or advance is extended and is recognized as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on
our consolidated balance sheets. The fixed interest or fee is amortized into revenues from other value added services based on the amount repaid over the
repayment period. We estimate the repayment period for PPWC based on the merchant’s payment processing history with PayPal. For PPWC, there is a general
requirement that at least 10% of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must be repaid every 90 days. We calculate the repayment rate of
the merchant’s future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within 9 to 12 months from the
date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual
repayment periods are dependent on actual merchant payment processing volumes. For PPBL, we receive fixed periodic payments over the contractual term of
the loan, which generally ranges from 3 to 12 months.
We actively monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected or contractual repayment period, as well as the credit quality of our
merchant loans and advances that we extend or purchase so that we can evaluate, quantify, and manage our credit risk exposure. To assess a merchant seeking a
loan or advance, we use, among other indicators, risk models developed internally which utilize information obtained from multiple internal and external data
sources to predict the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fee. Primary
drivers of the models include the merchant’s annual payment volume, payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with PayPal’s credit
products where available, information sourced from consumer and business credit bureau reports, and other information obtained during the application
process. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making (or, in the U.S., to assist the partner institution in making) ongoing credit decisions, to adjust
our internal models, to plan our collection strategies, and in determining our allowance for these loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable.

The decrease in the charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year was due to the charge-off of accounts in 2021 that

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
For merchant loans and advances, the determination of delinquency is based on the current expected or contractual repayment period of the loan or advance
and fixed interest or fee payment as compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our
PPBL product when the repayments are 180 days past the contractual repayment date. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPWC product
when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days, or when the repayments
are 360 days past due regardless of whether the merchant has made a payment in the last 60 days. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of
receiving notification of bankruptcy. The provision for credit losses on merchant loans and advances is recognized in transaction and credit losses on our
consolidated statements of income (loss), and the provision for interest and fees receivable is recognized as a reduction of deferred revenue in accrued expenses
and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable and
subsequent recoveries, if any, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for loans and interest receivable.
Troubled debt restructurings
In certain instances where a merchant is able to demonstrate that it is experiencing financial difficulty, there may be a modification of the loan or advance and
the related interest or fee receivable for which it is probable that, without modification, we would be unable to collect all amounts due. These modifications are
intended to provide merchants with financial relief, and help enable us to mitigate losses.
These modifications include an increase in term by approximately 1 to 5.5 years while moving the delinquency status to current. The fee on certain of these
loans or advances remains unchanged over the extended term. Alternatively, certain loans and advances have been modified to replace the initial fixed fee
structure at the time the loan or advance was extended with a fixed annual percentage rate applied over the amended remaining term, which will continue to
accrue interest at the fixed rate until the earlier of maturity or charge-off. These modifications had a de minimis impact on our consolidated statements of
income (loss) in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Allowances for TDRs are assessed separately from other loans and advances within our portfolio and are determined by estimating current expected credit
losses utilizing the modified term and interest rate assumptions. Historical loss estimates are utilized in addition to macroeconomic assumptions to determine
expected credit loss rates. Further, we may include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates
of our current expected credit losses.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivables which have been modified as TDRs were de minimis.
The following table shows merchant loans, advances and interest and fees receivables which were modified as TDRs in the year ended December 31, 2021:
Year Ended December 31, 2021
Number of Accounts
(in thousands)Outstanding Balances
(in millions)Weighted Average Payment Term Extensions
(in months)
Loans and interest receivable 3 $ 45 36
 Balances are as of modification date.
A merchant is considered in payment default after a modification when the merchant’s payment becomes 60 days past their expected or contractual repayment
date. For loans or advances that have defaulted after being modified, the increased estimate of current expected credit loss is factored into overall expected
credit losses. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivables classified as TDRs
that have subsequently defaulted on payments was de minimis.
NOTE 12—DEBT
FIXED RATE NOTES
In May 2022, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. Interest on these notes is payable on
June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2022.
In May 2020, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion. Interest on these notes is payable on
June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2020.(1)

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
In September 2019, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion. Interest on these notes is payable
in arrears semiannually (payable on April 1 and October 1).
The notes issued from the May 2022, May 2020, and September 2019 debt issuances are senior unsecured obligations and are collectively referred to as the
“Notes.” We may redeem the Notes in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, prior to maturity, at their redemption prices. Upon the occurrence of
both a change of control of the Company and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating, we will be required to offer to repurchase each series
of Notes at a price equal to 101% of the then outstanding principal amounts, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes are subject to covenants, including
limitations on our ability to create liens on our assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and merge or consolidate with another entity, in each case
subject to certain exceptions, limitations, and qualifications. Proceeds from the issuance of these Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may
include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses,
assets, or strategic investments.
In May 2022, we repurchased certain Notes under the September 2019 and May 2020 debt issuances prior to maturity through tender offers. In addition, in
June 2022, we redeemed the outstanding balance of the notes maturing in September 2022 through a make-whole redemption. We repurchased and redeemed
$1.6 billion of outstanding Notes, as described above, which resulted in de minimis debt extinguishment net gains that were recorded as interest expense within
other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income (loss).
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of $10.4 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, related to the Notes. The
following table summarizes the Notes:

The effective interest rates for the Notes include interest on the Notes, amortization of debt issuance costs, and amortization of the debt discount. The interest
expense recorded for the Notes, including amortization of the debt discount, debt issuance costs, and debt extinguishment net gains, was $290 million, $224
million, and $190 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
CREDIT FACILITIES
Five-year revolving credit facility
In September 2019, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility
that includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $500 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility
reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. Loans borrowed under the Credit Agreement are
available in U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar, and in each case subject to the sub-limits and other limitations provided in
the Credit Agreement. We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders and satisfaction of specified conditions, increase the commitments under
the revolving credit facility by up to $2.0 billion. Subject to specific conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers
under the Credit Agreement, provided PayPal Holdings, Inc. guarantees the portion of borrowings made available and other obligations of any such subsidiaries
under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, certain subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed under the Credit
Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other purposes not in contravention with the Credit Agreement.
We are obligated to pay interest on loans under the Credit Agreement and other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an upfront
fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating. Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either (i) the applicable eurocurrency rate plus a
margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from 0.875% to 1.375%, (ii) the applicable overnight rate plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings)
ranging from 0.875% to 1.375%, (iii) a formula based on the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate, or London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin
(based on our public debt ratings) ranging from zero to 0.375%, or (iv) a formula based on the Euro Short-Term Rate (“ESTR”) or the Sterling Overnight Index
Average (“SONIA”) rate plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from 0.875% to 1.375%. In January 2022, an amendment to the agreement
was signed which provides for the additional borrowing rate option of utilizing SONIA or ESTR rates. The Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts
owed thereunder will be due and payable in September 2024, unless the commitments are terminated earlier. The Credit Agreement contains customary
representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the
lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and the incurrence of subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to
certain exceptions. The financial covenant requires us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.
In March 2020, we drew down $3.0 billion under the Credit Agreement. In May 2020, we repaid the $3.0 billion using proceeds from the May 2020 debt
issuance. As of December 31, 2022, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022, $5.0
billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. The total
interest expense and fees we recorded related to the Credit Agreement was approximately $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Paidy credit agreement
In February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Paidy Credit Agreement”) with Paidy as co-borrower, which provides for an unsecured revolving
credit facility of ¥60.0 billion. In September 2022, the Paidy Credit Agreement was modified to increase the borrowing capacity by ¥30.0 billion for a total
borrowing capacity of ¥90.0 billion (approximately $686 million as of December 31, 2022.) Borrowings under the Paidy Credit Agreement are for use by Paidy
for working capital, capital expenditures, and other permitted purposes. Loans under the Paidy Credit Agreement bear interest at the Tokyo Interbank Offered
Rate plus a margin (based on our public debt rating) ranging from 0.40% to 0.60%. The Paidy Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owed
thereunder will be due and payable in February 2027, unless the commitments are terminated earlier. The Paidy Credit Agreement contains customary
representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the
lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions.
The financial covenant requires us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
In the year ended December 31, 2022, ¥64.3 billion (approximately $491 million) was drawn down under the Paidy Credit Agreement, which was recorded in
long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022, ¥25.7 billion (approximately $195 million) of borrowing capacity was
available for the purposes permitted by the Paidy Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. During the year ended December 31, 2022,
the total interest expense and fees we recorded related to the Paidy Credit Agreement were de minimis.
Prior credit agreement
In October 2021, we assumed a credit agreement through our acquisition of Paidy (the “Prior Credit Agreement”), which provided for a secured revolving
credit facility of ¥22.8 billion (approximately $198 million at acquisition). As of December 31, 2021, ¥11.3 billion (approximately $98 million) was
outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement, which was recorded in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2022, we
terminated the Prior Credit Agreement and repaid all outstanding borrowings. The total interest expense and fees we recorded related to the Prior Credit
Agreement were de minimis for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Other available facilities
We also maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world, which had a borrowing capacity of approximately $80 million and $90
million in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This available credit includes facilities where we can withdraw and utilize the funds
at our discretion for general corporate purposes. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with
strong credit ratings. As of December 31, 2022, the majority of the borrowing capacity under these credit facilities was available, subject to customary
conditions to borrowing.
FUTURE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS
As of December 31, 2022, the future principal payments associated with our term debt were as follows (in millions):
2023 $ 418 
2024 1,250 
2025 1,000 
2026 1,250 
2027 500 
Thereafter 6,000 
Total $ 10,418 
NOTE 13—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
COMMITMENTS
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately $4.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, of unused credit was available to PayPal Credit account holders
in the U.K. While this amount represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, that all our PayPal Credit account
holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time. In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to
periodic review and termination based on, among other things, account usage and customer creditworthiness.

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS
Overview
We are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminate amount
of damages or penalties or may require us to change or adopt certain business practices. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can
be reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements at that time. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we
accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than
any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we
have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of
losses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate the
probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a legal
proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies sought by
plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business.
With respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 13, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the
application of such non-monetary remedies.
Amounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable and reasonably estimable were not material for the year ended
December 31, 2022. Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this Note 13, we have concluded, based on currently available information, that
reasonably possible losses arising directly from the proceedings (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded
accruals are also not material. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of
uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. We may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. If any of our
estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.
Regulatory proceedings
We routinely report to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) on payments we have rejected or blocked pursuant to
legal requirements under OFAC sanctions regulations. Between January 2013 and January 2022, we voluntarily disclosed to OFAC transactions that were
inadvertently processed and identified as possible violations of OFAC sanctions regulations and responded to subpoenas and information requests related to
certain of these transactions. In January 2023, OFAC notified us that it had completed its review of these matters and closed them with the issuance of a
cautionary letter with no monetary penalties or sanctions.
PayPal Australia Pty Limited (“PPAU”) self-reported a potential violation to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (“AUSTRAC”) on May
22, 2019. This self-reported matter relates to PPAU incorrectly filing required international funds transfer instructions (“IFTIs”) over a period of time under the
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (“AML/CTF Act”). On September 23, 2019, PPAU received a notice from AUSTRAC
requiring that PPAU appoint an external auditor (a partner of a firm which is not our independent auditor) to review certain aspects of PPAU’s compliance with
its obligations under the AML/CTF Act. The external auditor was appointed on November 1, 2019. As required under the terms of AUSTRAC’s notice, as
amended, PPAU issued to AUSTRAC the external auditor’s interim reports on December 31, 2019, March 13, 2020, May 6, 2020, and July 7, 2020 and a final
report on August 31, 2020.
AUSTRAC has notified PPAU that its enforcement team is investigating the matters reported upon by the external auditor in its August 31, 2020 final report.
AUSTRAC continues to engage with PPAU regarding the transaction categories it considers reportable under the AML/CTF Act as IFTIs. PPAU is continuing
to cooperate with AUSTRAC in all respects, including remediation activities, ongoing regular engagement with AUSTRAC, and responding to notices and
requests for information and documents.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We cannot estimate the potential impact, if any, on our business or financial statements at this time. In the event an adverse outcome arises from any associated
enforcement proceeding, or other further matter initiated by AUSTRAC, including in relation to AUSTRAC’s determination of reportable IFTIs, then this could
result in enforceable undertakings, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in
a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business.
We have received Civil Investigative Demands (“CIDs”) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) related to Venmo’s unauthorized funds
transfers and collections processes, and related matters, including treatment of consumers who request payments but accidentally designate an unintended
recipient. The CIDs request the production of documents and answers to written questions. We are cooperating with the CFPB in connection with these CIDs.
We previously received a CID from the CFPB related to the marketing and use of PayPal Credit in connection with certain merchants that provide educational
services (the “CFPB PayPal Credit Matter”). The CID requested the production of documents, written reports, and answers to written questions. We have been
informed by the CFPB that this matter has been formally closed without action.
We are responding to subpoenas and requests for information received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Enforcement Division
relating to whether the interchange rates paid to the bank that issues debit cards bearing our licensed brands were consistent with Regulation II of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and to the reporting of marketing fees earned from the PayPal-branded card programs (the “SEC Debit Card
Program Matter”). We are cooperating with the SEC Enforcement Division in connection with this investigation.
In February 2022, we received a CID from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) related to PayPal’s practices relating to commercial customers that submit
charges on behalf of other merchants or sellers, and related activities. The CID requests the production of documents and answers to written questions. We are
cooperating with the FTC in connection with this CID.
In January 2023, we received notice of an administrative proceeding and a related request for information from the German Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”)
related to terms in PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A.’s contractual terms with merchants in Germany prohibiting surcharging and requiring parity
presentation of PayPal relative to other payment methods. We are cooperating with the FCO in connection with this proceeding.
Legal proceedings
On August 20, 2021, a putative securities class action captioned Kang v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 21-cv-06468, was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California (the “Kang Securities Action”). The Kang Securities Action asserts claims relating to our disclosure of the CFPB
PayPal Credit Matter and the SEC Debit Card Program Matter in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2021. The Kang
Securities Action purports to be brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s stock between February 9, 2017 and July 28, 2021 (the “Class Period”), and
asserts claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, and former
Chief Financial Officer. The complaint alleges that certain public statements made by the Company during the Class Period were rendered materially false and
misleading (which, allegedly, caused the Company’s stock to trade at artificially inflated prices) by the defendants’ failure to disclose that, among other things,
PayPal’s business practices with respect to PayPal Credit and regarding interchange rates paid to its bank partner related to its bank-issued co-branded debit
cards were non-compliant with applicable laws and/or regulations. The Kang Securities Action seeks unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of the
putative class members. On November 2, 2021, the court appointed a Lead Plaintiff, and on January 25, 2022, the Lead Plaintiff filed an amended complaint.
The amended complaint alleges a class period between April 27, 2016 and July 28, 2021 (the “Amended Class Period”), and in addition to the Company, its
Chief Executive Officer, and former Chief Financial Officer, also names other Company executives as defendants. The amended complaint alleges that various
statements made by the defendants during the Amended Class Period were rendered materially false and misleading, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by PayPal’s alleged violations of the 2015 consent order with the CFPB, federal consumer financial laws, and Regulation
II. On August 8, 2022, the court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety, and granted Lead Plaintiff’s request for leave to
file a further amended complaint. On September 16, 2022, Lead Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (the “SAC”), which asserts the same claims
against the same Defendants based on the same alleged conduct as the prior complaint. Defendants moved to dismiss the SAC on November 3, 2022, and
briefing is ongoing.

On December 16, 2021 and January 19, 2022, two related putative shareholder derivative actions captioned Pang v. Daniel Schulman, et al., Case No. 21-cv-
09720, and Lalor v. Daniel Schulman, et al., Case No. 22-cv-00370, respectively, were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
(the “California Derivative Actions”), purportedly on behalf of the Company. On August 2, 2022, a related putative shareholder derivative action captioned
Jefferson v. Daniel Schulman, et al., No. 2022-0684, was filed in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Derivative Action,” and
collectively with the California Derivative Actions, the “Derivative Actions”), purportedly on behalf of the Company. The Derivative Actions are based on the
same alleged facts and circumstances as the Kang Securities Action, and name certain of our officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and former Chief
Financial Officer, and members of our Board of Directors, as defendants. The Derivative Actions allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,
abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and seek to recover damages on
behalf of the Company. On February 1, 2022, the court entered an order consolidating the two California Derivative Actions and staying them until all motions
to dismiss in the Kang Securities Action are resolved.
On October 4, 2022, a putative securities class action captioned Defined Benefit Plan of the Mid-Jersey Trucking Industry and Teamsters Local 701 Pension
and Annuity Fund v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 22-cv-5864, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. On January 11,
2023, the Court appointed Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec as lead plaintiff and renamed the action In re PayPal Holdings, Inc. Securities Litigation
(“PPH Securities Action”). The PPH Securities Action asserts claims relating to our public statements with respect to net new active accounts (“NNA”) results
and guidance, and the detection of illegitimately created accounts. The PPH Securities Action purports to be brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s
stock between February 3, 2021 and February 1, 2022 (the “Class Period”), and asserts claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, and former Chief Financial Officer. The complaint alleges that certain public
statements made by the Company during the Class Period were rendered materially false and misleading (which, allegedly, caused the Company’s stock to
trade at artificially inflated prices) by the defendants’ failure to disclose that, among other things, the Company’s incentive campaigns were susceptible to fraud
and led to the creation of illegitimate accounts, which allegedly affected the Company’s NNA results and guidance. The PPH Securities Action seeks
unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of the putative class members.
On November 2, 2022, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned Shah v. Daniel Schulman, et al., Case No. 22-cv-1445, was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Delaware (the “Shah Action”), purportedly on behalf of the Company. The Shah Action is based on the same alleged facts and
circumstances as the PPH Securities Action, and names certain of our officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer, and
members of our Board of Directors, as defendants. The Shah Action alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty,
unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Company.
General matters
Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We are subject
to patent disputes and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our business as our
products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought directly or indirectly against our companies and/or against our
customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposure to such claims as a
result of our acquisitions, particularly in cases where we are introducing new products or services in connection with such acquisitions. We have in the past
been forced to litigate such claims, and we believe that additional lawsuits alleging such claims will be filed against us. Intellectual property claims, whether
meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business, or could require us
to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or make substantial payments to settle claims or to satisfy damages awarded by courts.

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by our customers
(individually or as class actions) or regulators alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules, or policies, that our practices, prices, rules,
policies, or customer/user agreements violate applicable law, or that we have acted unfairly or not acted in conformity with such prices, rules, policies, or
agreements. In addition to these types of disputes and regulatory inquiries, our operations are also subject to regulatory and legal review and challenges that
may reflect the increasing global regulatory focus to which the payments industry is subject and, when taken as a whole with other regulatory and legislative
action, such actions could result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens on our business and customers and may lead to increased costs and
decreased transaction volume and revenue. Further, the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our business has grown and
expanded in scale and scope, including the number of active accounts and payments transactions on our platform, the range and increasing complexity of the
products and services that we offer, and our geographical operations. Any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time
consuming, result in costly litigation, settlement payments, damage awards (including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions),
fines, penalties, injunctive relief, or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to change our business practices in
expensive ways, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business.
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS
Our agreements with eBay governing our separation from eBay provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations for both eBay and us. Disputes between
eBay and us have arisen and others may arise in the future, and an adverse outcome in such matters could materially and adversely impact our business, results
of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against eBay under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us, and our
indemnity obligations to eBay may be significant.
In the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial
relationships. Under these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with claims by any third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos, and other branding elements to the extent
that such marks are related to the subject agreement. We have provided an indemnity for other types of third-party claims, which may include indemnities
related to intellectual property rights, confidentiality, willful misconduct, data privacy obligations, and certain breach of contract claims, among others. We
have also provided an indemnity to our payments processors in the event of card association fines against the processor arising out of conduct by us or our
customers. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification
claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.
PayPal has participated in the U.S. Government’s Paycheck Protection Program administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Loans made under
this program are funded by an independent chartered financial institution that we partner with. We receive a fee for providing services in connection with these
loans and retain operational and audit risk related to those activities. We have agreed, under certain circumstances, to indemnify the chartered financial
institution and its assignee of a portion of these loans in connection with the services provided for loans made under this program.
 
To date, no significant costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification provisions.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on
our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

PROTECTION PROGRAMS
We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain transactions completed on our payments platform. These programs are intended to
protect both merchants and consumers from loss primarily due to fraud and counterparty performance. Our Purchase Protection Program provides protection to
consumers for qualifying purchases by reimbursing the consumer for the full amount of the purchase if a purchased item does not arrive or does not match the
seller’s description. Our Seller Protection Programs provide protection to merchants against claims that a transaction was not authorized by the buyer or claims
that an item was not received by covering the seller for the full amount of the payment on eligible sales. These protection programs are considered assurance-
type warranties under applicable accounting standards for which we estimate and record associated costs in transaction and credit losses during the period the
payment transaction is completed.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowance for transaction losses was $66 million and $121 million, respectively. The allowance for negative customer
balances was $212 million and $234 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The following table shows changes in the allowance for transaction
losses and negative customer balances related to our protection programs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

NOTE 14—STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS
In April 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no
expiration from the date of authorization. In July 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the
repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. This program became effective in the first quarter of
2020 upon completion of the April 2017 stock repurchase program. In June 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program
that provides for the repurchase of up to $15 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. Our stock repurchase programs are
intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make
opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made
through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase agreements, or other means at times
and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Moreover, any stock
repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. We may terminate
our stock repurchase programs at any time without prior notice.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately 41 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4.2 billion at an average
cost of $103.47. These shares were purchased in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in July 2018. As of December 31, 2022, a
total of approximately $861 million and $15.0 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2018 and June 2022 stock
repurchase programs, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately 15 million shares of our common stock for approximately $3.4 billion at an average
cost of $219.75. These shares were purchased in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in July 2018. As of December 31, 2021, a
total of approximately $5.1 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2018 stock repurchase program.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares of our common stock for approximately $1.6 billion at an average
cost of $136.19. These shares were purchased in the open market under our stock repurchase programs authorized in April 2017 and July 2018. As of
December 31, 2020, a total of approximately $8.4 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2018 stock repurchase
program.
Shares of common stock repurchased for the periods presented were recorded as treasury stock for the purposes of calculating net income (loss) per share and
were accounted for under the cost method. No repurchased shares of common stock have been retired.
NOTE 15—STOCK-BASED AND EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS
EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS
Under the terms of the Amended and Restated PayPal Holdings, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the “Plan”), equity awards, including restricted stock
units (“RSUs”), restricted stock awards, performance based restricted stock units (“PBRSUs”), stock options, deferred stock units, and stock payments, may be
granted to our directors, officers, and employees. At December 31, 2022, 47 million shares were authorized under the Plan and approximately 31 million shares
were available for future grant. Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises and the release of stock awards were funded primarily with the issuance of
new shares of common stock.
In 2022, the Company adopted a plan for which equity-based incentive awards may be granted to new employees (the “Inducement Plan”). Grants under the
Inducement Plan are in addition to the Plan mentioned above. As of December 31, 2022, 5 million shares were authorized under the Inducement Plan and
approximately 3 million shares were available for future grant.
RSUs are granted to eligible employees under the Plan. RSUs issued prior to January 1, 2022 generally vest in equal annual installments over a period of three
years. RSUs issued on or after January 1, 2022 generally vest over three years at a rate of 33% after one year, then in equal quarterly installments thereafter.
RSUs are subject to an employee’s continuing service to us, and do not have an expiration date. The cost of RSUs granted is determined using the fair market
value of PayPal’s common stock on the date of grant.
Certain of our executives and non-executives are eligible to receive PBRSUs, which are equity awards that may be earned based on an initial target number.
The final number of PBRSUs may vest and settle depending on the Company’s performance against pre-established performance metrics over a predefined
performance period. PBRSUs granted under the Plan generally have one to three-year performance periods with cliff vesting following the completion of the
performance period, subject to the Compensation Committee’s approval of the level of achievement against the pre-established performance targets. Over the
performance period, the number of PBRSUs that may be issued and related stock-based compensation expense that is recognized is adjusted upward or
downward based upon the probability of achieving the approved performance targets against the performance metrics. Depending on the probability of
achieving the pre-established performance targets, the number of PBRSUs issued could range from 0% to 200% of the target amount.
All stock options under the Plan were assumed in connection with acquisitions on the same terms and conditions (including vesting) applicable to such
acquired companies’ equity awards. The cost of stock options was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
Under the terms of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), shares of our common stock may be purchased over an offering period with a maximum
duration of two years at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first day of the applicable offering period or on the last business day of each six-month
purchase period within the offering period. Employees may contribute between 2% and 10% of their gross compensation during an offering period to purchase
shares, but not more than the statutory limitation of $25,000 per year. All company stock purchased through the ESPP is considered outstanding and is included
in the weighted-average outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted net income (loss) per share. For the years ended December 31, 2022,
2021, and 2020, our employees purchased 1.9 million, 1.4 million, and 1.7 million shares under the ESPP at an average per share price of $73.20, $114.36, and
$80.36, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 46 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.

Includes approximately 0.5 million of additional PBRSUs issued during 2022 due to the achievement of company performance metrics on awards granted in previous years.
Includes approximately 1.0 million of PBRSUs cancelled during 2022 resulting from a change in the method of payout of the Company portion of our Annual Incentive Plan from equity to cash for
certain employees.
During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs and PBRSUs vested under the Plan was $935 million, $3.4
billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively.
In the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company granted 1.5 million PBRSUs with a one-year performance period (fiscal 2022) of which 1.0 million were
subsequently cancelled due to the change in method of payout as mentioned above. As such, 0.5 million will become fully vested following the completion of
the performance period in February 2023 (one year from the annual incentive award cycle grant date). In the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company also
granted 1.1 million PBRSUs with a three-year performance period.
In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company granted 0.7 million PBRSUs with a one-year performance period (fiscal 2021), which became fully vested
following the completion of the performance period in February 2022 (one year from the annual incentive award cycle grant date), and 0.5 million PBRSUs

The weighted average grant date fair value of options assumed from acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $147.92,
$237.26 and $108.61, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the
quoted price of our common stock at December 31, 2022. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the aggregate intrinsic value of options
exercised under the Plan was $16 million, $81 million, and $66 million, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. At December 31, 2022,
substantially all outstanding options were in-the-money.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE
Stock-based compensation expense for the Plan and the Inducement Plan is measured based on estimated fair value at the time of grant, and recognized over
the award’s vesting period.
The impact on our results of operations of recording stock-based compensation expense under the Plan for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and
2020 was as follows:

Income tax benefit recognized for stock-based compensation arrangements $ 209 $ 221 $ 226 
As of December 31, 2022, there was approximately $1.4 billion of unearned stock-based compensation estimated to be expensed primarily from 2023 through
2025. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards, we may be required to accelerate, increase, or cancel all or a portion of
the remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. Future unearned stock-based compensation will increase to the extent we grant additional equity
awards, change the mix of equity awards we grant, or assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions.
EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS
Under the terms of the PayPal Holdings, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, which also qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Code, participating U.S.
employees may contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation, but not more than statutory limits. Under the PayPal plan, eligible employees received one
dollar for each dollar contributed, up to 4% of each employee’s eligible salary, subject to a maximum employer contribution per employee of $12,200 in 2022
and $11,600 in both 2021 and 2020. Our non-U.S. employees are covered by other savings plans. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the
matching contribution expense for our U.S. and international savings plans was approximately $83 million, $81 million, and $72 million, respectively.

Intra-group transfer of intellectual property 10.0 % 0.7 % 4.1 %
Other 4.0 % — % 0.2 %
Effective income tax rate 28.1 % (1.7) % 17.0 %
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the difference between the effective income tax rate of 28.1% and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% to income
before income taxes was primarily the result of tax expense related to the intra-group transfer of intellectual property and non-deductible stock-based
compensation, partially offset by foreign income taxed at different rates. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the difference between the effective income
tax rate of (1.7)% and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% to income before income taxes was primarily the result of foreign income taxed at different rates
and stock-based compensation deductions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the difference between the effective income tax rate of 17.0% and the U.S.
federal statutory rate of 21% to income before income taxes was primarily the result of foreign income taxed at different rates, partially offset by tax expense
related to the intra-group transfer of intellectual property.

Total deferred tax liabilities (non-current) Deferred tax liability and other long-term liabilities (25) (186)
Total net deferred tax assets $ 1,285 $ 361 
As of December 31, 2022, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $6 million, $156
million, and $634 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Code.
If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025, and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in
2023. Approximately $197 million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024, $191 million will begin to expire in 2034, and
$246 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2022, our federal and state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were
approximately $24 million and $374 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal tax credits will begin to expire in 2029. Approximately $49 million of the
state tax credits will begin to expire from 2023 through 2028, $8 million will begin to expire in 2038, and $317 million may be carried forward indefinitely.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. We have elected the tax law ordering approach to assess the realizability of our net operating losses. During the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, we increased our valuation allowance by $67 million and $108 million, respectively, and during the year ended December 31, 2020, we
decreased our valuation allowance by $18 million. At December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to our net
deferred tax assets in certain states, operating losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions, and certain federal and state tax credits that we believe are not
likely to be realized.

At December 31, 2022, none of our approximately $11.0 billion of unremitted foreign earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. We have accrued
$42 million of deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes on the $11.0 billion of undistributed foreign earnings.
We benefit from agreements concluded in certain jurisdictions, most significantly Singapore. In December 2019, a new agreement was concluded in Singapore.
The new agreement took effect January 1, 2021 and will be in effect from 2021 through 2030. This agreement results in significantly lower rates of taxation on
certain classes of income and requires various thresholds of investment and employment in those jurisdictions. We review our compliance on an annual basis to
ensure we continue to meet our obligations under this agreement. This agreement resulted in tax savings of approximately $510 million, $327 million, and
$596 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The benefit of this agreement on our net income (loss) per share (diluted) was approximately $0.44, $0.28,
and $0.50 in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
The following table reflects changes in unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented below:
 Year Ended December 31,

Statute of limitation expirations (3) (3) (2)
Gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as of the end of the period $ 1,877 $ 1,678 $ 1,479 
If the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $1.2 billion.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recognized net interest and penalties of $119 million, $6 million, and $40 million, respectively,
related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. This expense is reflected in the “Other” line of our effective income tax rate schedule. The amount of
interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $342 million and $212 million, respectively.
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by certain tax authorities for the 2010 to
2021 tax years. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to examination by tax authorities for tax years after 2009 primarily include the U.S. (Federal
and California), Australia, Germany, India, Israel, and Singapore. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may
ultimately result from our open examinations.
Although the timing of the resolution of these audits is uncertain, we do not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 will
materially change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we
are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.
In connection with our separation from eBay in 2015, we entered into various agreements that govern the relationship between the parties going forward,
including a tax matters agreement. Under the tax matters agreement, eBay is generally responsible for all additional taxes (and will be entitled to all related
refunds of taxes) imposed on eBay and its subsidiaries (including subsidiaries that were transferred to PayPal pursuant to the separation) arising after the
separation date with respect to the taxable periods (or portions thereof) ended on or prior to July 17, 2015, except for those taxes for which PayPal has reflected
an unrecognized tax benefit in its financial statements on the separation date.

NOTE 17—RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
During the first quarter of 2022, management initiated a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce intended to streamline and optimize our global
operations to enhance operating efficiency. This effort focused on reducing redundant operations and simplifying our organizational structure. The associated
restructuring charges in 2022 were $121 million. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, as well as associated consulting costs under the
2022 strategic reduction. The strategic actions associated with this plan were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2022.
The following table summarizes the restructuring reserve activity during the year ended December 31, 2022:

During the first quarter of 2020, management approved a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce as part of a multiphase process to reorganize our
workforce concurrently with the redesign of our operating structure, which spanned multiple quarters. The associated restructuring charges in 2021 and 2020
were $27 million, and $109 million, respectively. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, as well as associated consulting costs under the
2020 strategic reduction, which was substantially completed in 2021.
Additionally, we are continuing to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset
impairment charges of $81 million, $26 million, and $30 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, due to exiting of certain leased properties which
resulted in a reduction of ROU lease assets and related leasehold improvements. See “Note 6—Leases” for additional information.
NOTE 18—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In January 2023, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve our cost structure and
operating efficiency. We estimate that this reduction will impact approximately 7% of our employees and will result in approximately $100 million of
restructuring charges, primarily related to employee severance and benefits costs. The actions associated with this plan are expected to be substantially
completed by the first quarter of 2023.
