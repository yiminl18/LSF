Table of Contents
Direct-Store-Delivery
We, our independen t bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages and convenient foods directly to
retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise
with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store
promotion and merchandising.
Customer W arehouse
Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, both company and third-party
operated, to custome r warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable,
and have lower turnover .
Distributor Networks
We distrib ute many  of our products through third-party distributors. Third-p arty distributors are particularly effective when
greater distribution reach can be achiev ed by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our
foodservice and vending business distributes beverages and convenient foods to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums
through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.
E-commerce
Our produ cts are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-
commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.
Ingredients and Other Supplies
The principal ingredients we use in our beverage and convenient food products are aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings,
flour , juice  concentrates, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar , vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We
also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for convenient foods,
aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product
development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel,
electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’
facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and
have not experience d any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these
ingredients, raw materials and commod ities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to
fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and
derivative instrumen ts, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through
purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our
customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply
chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it
further globally . During 2022, we continued to experience increased commodi ty, packaging and other input costs and, in some
instances, supply constraints related to the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the
inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, which has continued
into fiscal  2023. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to
commodity prices.
We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions, pursuant to
which our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to such global financial
institutions. These agreements did not have a material

hold long- term licen ses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Ocean Spray .
We also distribute Celsius ener gy drinks and various Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush
and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which  we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks,
such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. In addition, in the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice
brands to PAI Partne rs, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. In the
United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBG’ s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers
with chille d DSD. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. In 2022, we began to distribute
Hard MTN Dew, an alcoholic beverage manufactured and owned by the Boston Beer Company . We have licensed the use of the
Hard MTN  Dew trademark to the Boston Beer Company , which has appointed us as their distributor for this product. Trademarks
remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We
have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as convenient food joint
ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at
retail, which enhances brand awareness.
We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certa in of our products, their packaging, the processes
for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed
to others.
Seasonality
Our businesses are affected by seasona l variations. Our beverage and convenient food sales are generally highest in the third
quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter . However , taken as a whole,
seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results.

Our Customers
Our custom ers inclu de wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores,
discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized
independent bottlers , among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture
certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right
to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process
required for product  quality . We also grant distribution rights to our independe nt bottlers for certain beverage products bearing
our trademarks for specified geographic areas.
We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the
consumer . For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees,
promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated
annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support,
new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and
promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent
bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as
point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs
support the acquisition and placement  of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary
annually .
Changes to the retail landscape, includi ng increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of sales through e-
commerce websites  and mobile comme rce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer
businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard
discounters, and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2022, sales to
Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and its affiliates, including Sam’ s Club (Sam’ s), represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net
revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used
in finished  goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA
and PBNA divisions.
Our Competition
Our beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categori es and markets and compete against products of
international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and
private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors, inclu ding smaller companies developing and selling
micro brands directl y to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In
many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage
competitor . Other beverage and convenient food competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company , Conagra
Brands, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kellogg Company , Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company , Link Snacks,
Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc.
Many of our conven ient food products hold significant leadership positions in the convenient food industry in the United States
and worldwide. In 2022, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approx imately 20% and 21%, respectively , of the U.S.
liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc.
However , The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the
United States.

Our beverage and convenient food products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty , taste, price, value,
quality , product variety , innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging,
convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased
consumer focus on health and wellness  and sustainability and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of
distributing and purchasing products. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing
products, effective introduction of new products and reformulations of existi ng products, increased efficiency in production
techniques, effective incorporation of technology and digital tools across all areas of our business, the effectiveness of our
advertising campaig ns, marketing programs, product packaging and pricing, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand
and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with
the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete ef fectively .
Resear ch and Development

needs of our custom ers and consumers and accelerating growth. These activi ties principally involve: innovations focused on
creating consumer preferred products to grow and transform our portfolio through development of new technologies, ingredients,
flavors and substrates; development and improvement of our manufacturing processes, including reductions in cost and
environmental footp rint; implementing  product improvements to our global portfolio that reduce added sugars, sodium or
saturated fat; offering more products with functional ingredients and positive nutrition including whole grains, fruit, vegetables,

United Kingdom and the United States , and leverage consumer insights, food science and engineering to meet our strategy to
continually innovate our portfolio of beverages and convenient foods.

regulating the ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products; laws regulating our supply chain, including
the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to comply
with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to
various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California,
which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having
been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level.
We are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws
and regulations governing food safety , international trade and tariffs, supply chains, including the U.K. Modern Slavery Act,
occupational health  and safety , competition, anti-corruption and data privacy , including the European Union General Data
Protection Regulatio n. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our
competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruptio n laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely
on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses
in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.
In addition , certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture,
distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in
the production of our products. These  taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric
beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g.,  sugar). Similarly , some measures apply a single
tax rate per ounce/l iter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a
graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweeten er) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate
on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the level of such substance or ingredient.
In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or
other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such
products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we highlight perceived
concerns about a product, warn consum ers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products,
restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available.
It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.
In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates,
encourage waste reduction or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These regulations vary in scope and form
from deposit return systems designed to incentivize
9

the return of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and even restrictions or bans on the use of certain
types of packaging, including single-us e plastics and packaging containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). It is
possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.
We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do
business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater dischar ge and air emissions. In the United
States, we are subje ct to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Compre hensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act, the Resource Conserv ation and Recovery Act and other federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding
handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed
facilities. Our operations outside the United States are subject to similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern
over environmental , social and govern ance matters, including climate change, is expected to continue to result in new or
increased legal and regulatory requirem ents (in or outside of the United States) to reduce emissions to mitigate the potential
effects of greenhous e gases, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns or
to expand mandatory reporting of certain environmental, social and governance  metrics. Our policy is to abide by all applicable
environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental
compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental
laws and regulation s and to achieve our sustainability goals. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our
business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and
expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements or to achieve our sustainability goals, could adversely affect our
financial performance. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the
normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical
activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses or properties acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these
environmental remediation and indemni fication obligations cannot be predicted with certainty , such obligations have not had, and
are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Human Capital
PepsiCo believes that human capital management, including attracting, developing and retaining a high quality workforce, is
critical to our long-term success. Our Board of Directors (Board) and its Committees provide oversight on a broad range of
human capital management topics, including corporate culture, diversity , equity and inclusion, pay equity , health and safety ,
training and development and compensation and benefits.
We emplo yed appro ximately 315,000 people worldwide as of December 31, 2022, including approximately 132,000 people
within the United States. We are party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and believe that relations with our
employees are generally good.
Protecting the safety , health, and well-b eing of our associates around the world is PepsiCo’ s top priority . We strive to achieve an
injury-free work environment. We also continue to invest in emer ging technologies to protect our employees from injuries,
including leveraging fleet telematics and distracted driving technology , resulting in reductions in road traffic incidents, and
deploying ergonomic and machine safety risk reduction solutions. In addition , throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have
remained focused on the health and safety of our associates, especially our frontline associates who continue to make, move and
sell our products during this critical time, including by continuing to imple ment various safety protocols in our facilities,
providing personal protective equipment and enabling testing. W e are

also focused on the safety of our associates in Ukraine and have provided humanitarian aid, goods and services to support our
people and communities facing the ongoing deadly conflict.
We believ e that our culture of diversity , equity and inclusion is a competitive advantage that fuels innovation, enhances our
ability to attract and retain talent and strengthens our reputation. We continual ly strive to improve the attraction, retention, and
advancement of diverse associates to ensure we sustain a high-caliber pipeline of talent that also represents the communities we
serve. As of December 31, 2022, our global workforce was approximately 27% female, while management roles were
approximately 44% female. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 48% of our U.S. workforce was comprised of
racially/ethnically diverse individuals, of which approximately 33% of our U.S. associates in managerial roles were
racially/ethnically diverse individuals. The Board has overseen appointments of current direct reports of our Chief Executive
Officer, who include 7 executives globally who are racially/ethnically diverse and/or female.
We are also committed to the continued growth and development of our associates. PepsiCo supports and develops its associates
through a variety of global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees' leadership and professional
skills, including career development plans, mentoring programs and in-house learning opportunities, such as PEP U Degreed, our
internal global online learning resource. In 2022, PepsiCo employees completed over 1 million hours of training.

Business Risks
Risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine
The deadly conflict in Ukraine has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and certain of
our opera tions in Ukraine remain suspended. The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity
markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational
risk, heigh tened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian
ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, reduced
availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging and raw materials and other input costs, environmental,
health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or
regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary
or permanent loss of assets or result in additional impairment charges. We canno t predict how and the extent to which the conflict
will contin ue to affect our employees, operations, customers, consumers or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of
our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and
our global business.
Reduction in future demand for our products would adversely af fect our business.
Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to innovate and anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer
trends and preferenc es, including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for, purchase and consume
them. Consumer preferences continuously evolve due to a variety of factors,  including: changes in consumer demographics,
consumption pattern s and channel prefe rences (including continued increases in the e-commerce and online-to-of fline channels);
pricing; product quality; concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact (such as single-use and other
plastic packaging); and concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile and health effects of, or location of origin of,
ingredients or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether or not
scientifically valid).  Concerns with any of the foregoing could lead consumers to reduce or publicly boycott the purchase or
consumption of our products. Pandemics, epidemics or other disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have also impacted and
could continue to impact consumer preferences and demand for our products. Consumer preferences are also influenced by
perception of our brand image or the brand images of our products, the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, our
ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer , including through the use of digital media or assets, and the
perception of our use, the use of social media and our response to political and social issues or catastrophic events. These and
other facto rs have reduced in the past and could continue to reduce consumers’  willingness to purchase certain of our products.
Any inabi lity on our part to anticipate or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strategic
investments to do so, including investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our
products, lead to inventory write-of fs or erode our competitive and financial position, thereby adversely affecting our business. In
addition, our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics
or other events beyo nd our control that could negatively impact product availab ility and decrease demand for our products if our
crisis management plans do not ef fectively mitigate these issues.
Damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely af fect our business.
Maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been,
and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including: any failure by us or our business partners to
maintain high ethical, business and environmental, social and governance practices, including with respect to human rights, child
labor laws, diversity , equity and
12
Table of Contents
inclusion, workplac e conditions and employee health and safety; any failure, or perception of a failure, to achieve our
environmental, social and governance goals, including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products, diversity , equity and
inclusion initiatives,  packaging, water use and our impact on the environment; any failure to address health or other concerns
about our products, products we distribute (including alcoholic beverages), or particular ingredients in our products, including
concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity or an increase in public health costs; our research and
development efforts; any product quality or safety issues, including the recall of any of our products; any failure to comply with
laws and regulations ; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, spons orship arrangements, marketing programs, use of
social media and our response to political and social issues or catastrophic events; or any failure to effectively respond to
negative or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation
or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely af fecting our business.
Product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely af fect our business.
We have and could in the future recall products due to product quality or safety issues, including actual or alleged mislabeling,
misbranding, spoilage, undeclared allergens, adulteration or contamination. Joint ventures in which we have an interest have also
recalled, and could in the future recall, products for the same or other reasons. Product recalls have in the past and could in the
future adversely affect our business by resulting in losses due to their cost, the destruction of product inventory or lost sales due
to any unavailability  of the product for a period of time. In addition, product quality or safety issues, whether as a result of failure
to comply with food safety laws or otherwise, have in the past and could in the future also reduce consumer confidence and
demand for our products, cause production and delivery disruptions, and result in increased costs (including payment of fines
and/or judgments) and damage our reput ation (or the reputation of joint ventures in which we have an interest), particularly as we
or our joint venture s continue to expand into new categories, such as the distribution of alcoholic beverages, all of which can
adversely affect our business. Failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety can result in product recalls,
litigation, government investigations or inquiries or civil or criminal proceedings, all of which may result in fines, penalties,
damages or criminal liability . Our busin ess can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality , safety
and integrity generally , even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio.
Any inability to compete ef fectively can adversely af fect our business.
Our produ cts compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple
geographies, as well as regional, local and private label and economy brand manufacturers and other competitors, including
smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers
focused on locally sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-
Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor . Our products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty ,
taste, price , value, quality , product varie ty, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity , packaging,
convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends. Our business can
be adverse ly affected if we are unable to effectively promote or develop our existing products or introduce and effectively market
new products, if we are unable to effectively adopt new technologies, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to
develop new commercial insights and improve operating efficiencies, if we are unable to continuously strengthen and evolve our
capabilities in digital marketing, if our competitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to
effectively respond to supply disruptions, pricing pressure (including as a result of commodity inflation) or otherwise compete
effectively , and we may be
13
Table of Contents
unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures.
Failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce or effectively manage changes in our
workforce can have an adverse ef fect on our business.
Our busin ess requires that we attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Our employees are highly
sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to
attract, retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Our ability to do so has been and
may conti nue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market, which has experienced and may continue to experience wage
inflation, labor shortages, increased employee turnover , changes in availability of our workforce and a shift toward remote work.
Any unpla nned turnover , sustained labor shortage or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current
leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse
workforce, including with key capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills, can deplete our
institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for
employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. In addition, failure to attract, retain and develop
associates from underrepresented communities can damage our business results and our reputation. Any of the foregoing can
adversely af fect our business.
Water scarcity can adversely af fect our business.
We and our business  partners use water in the manufacturing of our products. Water is also essential to the production of the raw
materials needed in our manufacturing process. Lack of available water of acceptable quality , actions by governmental and non-
governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing pressure to conserve and
replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress, including due to the effects of climate change, can lead to: supply chain disruption;
adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our business partners; higher compliance costs; increased capital
expenditures (including investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce consumption);
higher production costs, including less favorable pricing for water; the interruption or cessation of operations at, or relocation of,
our facilities or the facilities of our business partners; failure to achieve our goals relating to water use; perception of our failure
to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to legal or regulatory requirements concerning water
scarcity; or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely af fect our business.
Changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer can adversely af fect our business.
The retail landscape continues to evolve, including continued growth in e-commerce channels and hard discounters. Our business
will be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard
discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom
are also focused on increasing their e-commerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard
discounters take significant additional market share away from traditional retail ers or we fail to find ways to create increasingly
better digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses. In addition, our business can
be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. The retail
industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power , particularly in North America, Europe
and Latin  America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power , impacting our ability to
compete in these areas. Consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers’ ability to compete ef fectively , resulting in an
inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further , we must maintain mutually
beneficial relationships with our key
14
Table of Contents
customers, including Walmart, to compete effectively . Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key
customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a
significant reduction in sales to any key customer , or the loss of any of our key customers can adversely af fect our business.
Disruption of our manufacturing operations or supply chain, including continued increased commodity , packaging,
transportation, labor and other input costs, can adversely af fect our business.
We have experience d and could continue to experience disruption in our manufa cturing operations and supply chain. Many of the
raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest, political
instability or unfavorable economic conditions. Some raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials, are available
only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There
can be no assuranc e that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangemen ts and relationships with suppliers or that our
contingency plans will be effective to mitigate disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any raw materials
and other supplies that we use in the manufacture, production and distribution of our products or from operational or financial
instability of our key suppliers. Any sustained or significant disruption in the future to the manufacturing or sourcing of products
or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply , which can adversely impact our business.
The raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities, fuel and packaging materials, such as recycled PET,
transportation, labor  and other supply chain inputs that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products
are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand,
supplier capacity constraints, inflation, weather conditions (including potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters,
disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty , health epidemics or
pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (including COVID-19), labor shortages or changes in availability of our or our business
partners’ workforce (including the lack of availability of truck drivers or as a result of COVID-19), strikes or work stoppages
(including by railway workers or other third parties involved in the manufactu re, production and distribution of our products),
governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or
trade barriers), port congestions or delays, transport capacity constraints, cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions, loss or
impairment of key manufacturing sites, political uncertainties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange
rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market  and the prices we pay for such items are subject
to fluctuat ion. We experienced higher than anticipated commodity , packaging and transportation costs during 2022, which may
continue. When input prices increase unexpectedly or significantly , we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices
or unable to effectively hedge against price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue,
margins and operating results.
Political and social conditions can adversely af fect our business.
Political and social conditions in the markets in which our products are sold have been and could continue to be difficult to
predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including
government shutdow ns or hostilities between countries) in these markets have in the past and could continue to impact how
existing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemen ted or result in uncertainty as to how such laws,
regulations, program s or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions, environmental and climate change
regulations, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between countries, relationships between
countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its gover nment and other matters, and has resulted in and
could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or
adversely af fect demand
15
Table of Contents
for our products, any of which can adversely affect our business. In addition , political and social conditions in certain cities
throughout the U.S. as well as globally have resulted in demonstrations and protests, including in connection with political
elections and civil rights and liberties. Our operations or the operations of our business partners, including the distribution of our
products and the ingredients or other raw materials used in the production of our products, may be disrupted if such events persist
for a prolonged period of time, includin g due to actions taken by governmental authorities in affected cities and regions, which
can adversely af fect our business.
Our business can be adversely af fected if we are unable to grow in developing and emerging markets.
Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emer ging markets, including Mexico, the
Middle East, China,  South Africa, Brazil and India. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted or be successful
in any particular developing or emer ging market, due to competition, price, cultural differences, consumer preferences, method of
distribution or otherwise. Our business in these markets has been and could continue in the future to be impacted by economic,
political and social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest, including demonstrations and protests; competition;
tariffs, sanctions or other regulations restricting contact with certain countries in these markets; foreign ownership restrictions;
nationalization of our assets or the assets of our business partners; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our
operations or the operations of our business partners; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or
substances used in our products; highly inflationary economies; devaluation or fluctuation or demonetization of currency;
regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions,
which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability to
effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses; the lack of
well-established or reliable legal system s; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S.
laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act
and the Trade Sanct ions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or
penalties, for any failure to comply with laws and regulations. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to expand
our busine ss in developing and emer ging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these
markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets.
Changes in economic conditions can adversely impact our business.
Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or
unfavorable econom ic conditions, such as high inflation and adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates, which could
result in recessions or economic slowdowns; volatile commodity markets; labor shortages; highly inflationary economies,
devaluation, fluctua tion or demonetization of currency; contraction in the availability of credit; austerity or stimulus measures;
the effects of any default by or deteriora tion in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are sold; or a decrease
in the fair value of pension or post- retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding
requirements of our pension or post-reti rement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions
will affect our business partners, includ ing financial institutions with whom we do business, and any negative impact on any of
the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business.
Future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems can adversely af fect our business.
We depen d on information systems and technology , including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities
important to our business, including communications within our company , interfacing
16
Table of Contents
with customers and consumers; ordering  and managing inventory; managing and operating our facilities; protecting confidential
information, includi ng personal data we collect; maintaining accurate financial records and complying with regulatory , financial
reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our business has in the past and could  in the future be negatively affected by system
shutdowns, degrade d systems performance, systems disruptions or security incidents. These disruptions or incidents may be
caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, network or power outag es, software, equipment or telecommunications
failures, the unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, natural disasters, fires or other catastrophic events. In
addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information
technology infrastructure, which can be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability , and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks
and other cyber incidents. Cyberattacks  and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently , the techniques used to gain
access to informatio n technology systems and data, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and
becoming more sophisticated in nature and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and
motives. Cyberattacks and cyber incidents may be difficult to detect for perio ds of time and take many forms including cyber
extortion, denial of service, social engineering, introduction of viruses or malware (such as ransomware), exploiting
vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking, website defacement or theft of passwords and other
credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromise. As with other
global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, including the types of attacks and incidents
described above. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue building and maintaining our
information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber
incidents, our business has been and can continue to be adversely affected, which has resulted in and can continue to result in
some or all of the following: transaction  errors, processing inefficiencies, inability to access our data or systems, lost revenues or
other costs resulting from disruptions or shutdowns of offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities,
intellectual property or other data loss, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or
penalties, remediation costs, damage to our reputation or a negative impact on employee morale and the loss of current or
potential customers.  In addition, these risks also exist in acquired businesses, joint ventures or companies we invest in or partner
with that use separate information systems or that have not yet been fully integrated into our information systems.
Similar risks exist with respect to our business partners and third-party providers, including suppliers, software and cloud-based
service providers, that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions,
including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and the
systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by such third parties and their vendors. For example, malicious actors have
employed and could continue to employ the information technology supply chain to introduce malware through software updates
or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. The need to coordinate with various third-party service providers, including with
respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to
address issues that arise. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities  associated with our third-party service providers
can adversely af fect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information.
Although the cyber incidents and other systems disruptions that we have experie nced to date have not had a material effect on our
business, such incidents or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. While we devote significant
resources to network security , disaster recovery , employee training and other measures to secure our information technology
systems and prevent unauthorized acces s to or loss of data, there are no guarante es that they will be adequate to safeguard against
all cyber incidents, systems disruptions, system compromises or misuses of data. In addition, while we currently
17
Table of Contents
maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intende d to address costs associated with certain aspects
of cyber incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and
circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our
reputation or brands that may result from an incident.
Failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely af fect our business.
We regula rly review  our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements,
divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions is dependent upon, among other
things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or syner gies as a result of a transaction,
within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals. Risks associated with
strategic transactions include integratin g manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative
support activities and information technology systems with our company or difficulties separating such personnel, activities and
systems in connection with divestitures; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating,
recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting,
disclosure controls and procedures and data protection and cybersecurity) and policies (including with respect to environmental
compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers
and attracting new customers and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or
refranchised busine sses in our supply or sales chain; inability to offset loss of revenue associated with divested brands or
businesses; managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have
different interests than we do; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation.
Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effective ly, or our failure to effectively manage the risks
associated with such transactions, have in the past and could continue to result in adverse ef fects on our business.
Our reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems can have an adverse ef fect on our business.
We rely on third-pa rty service providers, including cloud data service provid ers, for certain areas of our business, including
payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions. Failure by these third
parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance,
has in the past and could continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings or efficiencies and result in
additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead
to business disruption, systems performance degradation, processing inefficien cies or other systems disruptions, the loss of or
damage to intellectu al property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial
reporting, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs,
damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale, all of which can adversely af fect our business.
In addition, we continue on our multi-year phased business transformation initia tive to migrate certain of our systems, including
our financ ial proces sing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions and have begun to roll out these systems in certain
countries and divisions. We have experienced and could continue to experience systems outages and operating inefficiencies
following these planned implementations. In addition, if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to
build and sustain the proper informati on technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this
initiative, our business could be adversely af fected.

Climate change or measures to address climate change can negatively af fect our business or damage our reputation.
Climate change may increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather conditions (including rising
temperatures and drought), which could pose physical risks to our facilities, impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply
chain or impact demand for our product s. Climate change may also have a negative effect on agricultural production resulting in
decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes,
sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other commodities. Also, there is an increased focus in many jurisdictions in
which our products are made, manufac tured, distributed or sold regarding environmental policies relating to climate change,
regulating greenhou se gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability , including single-use plastics. This increased focus may
result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements, such as potential carbon pricing programs or revised product
labeling requirements or other regulatory measures, which could, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, continue
to result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of
climate change can negatively affect our business and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve or properly report on our
goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the
environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity , which
could result in reduced demand for our products, damage to our reputation or increase the risk of litigation. Any of the foregoing
can adversely af fect our business.
Strikes or work stoppages can cause our business to suf fer.
Many of our employ ees and employees of third parties that are involved in the manufacturing, production or distribution of our
products are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees  may seek to be covered by collective bargaining
agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions have occurred and may occur in the future if we or the third
parties that are invol ved in the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are unable to renew , or enter into new,
collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms and can impair manufac turing and distribution of our products, interrupt
product supply , lead to a loss of sales, increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational
changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy , all of which can adversely affect our
business.
Financial Risks
Failure to realize benefits from our productivity initiatives can adversely af fect our financial performance.
Our future  growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including our multi-year
phased implementation of shared business service organizational models. We continue to identify and implement productivity
initiatives that we believe will position  our business for long-term sustainable  growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost
structure, improve decision-making and operate more efficiently . Some of these measures result in unintended consequences,
such as business disruptions, distraction  of management and employees, reduced morale and productivity , unexpected employee
attrition, an inability to attract or retain  key personnel and negative publicity . If we are unable to successfully implement our
productivity initiativ es as planned or do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives, we may not realize all or any
of the anticipated benefits, resulting in adverse ef fects on our financial performance.
A deterior ation in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our business can result in
an impairment charge that can adversely af fect our results of operations.
We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if
circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. In addition, amortizable
19
Table of Contents
intangible assets, property , plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant
change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. A deterioration in our underlying assumptions regarding the impact of
competitive operating conditions, macr oeconomic conditions, including the interest rate environment, or other factors used to
estimate the future performance of any of our reporting units or assets, including any deterioration in the weighted-average cost
of capital based on market data available at the time, have resulted and could in the future result in an impairment charge, thereby
adversely af fecting our results of operations.
Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our financial performance.
Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside
the United  States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar , are translated into U.S. dollars. Given our global
operations, we also pay for the ingred ients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous currencies.
Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of inflation, central bank monetary policies, currency controls or other
currency exchange restrictions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial performance.
Our borro wing costs and access to capital and credit markets can be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential
downgrade of our credit ratings.
Rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability ,
levels of indebtedne ss, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally , as well as factors
beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry . We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access,
which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest
rates. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, especially any
downgrade to below investment grade, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit
markets on terms commercially accepta ble to us or at all, result in a reduction in our liquidity , or impair our ability to access the
commercial paper market with the same  flexibility that we have experienced historically (and therefore require us to rely more
heavily on more expensive types of debt financing), all of which can adversely af fect our financial performance.
Legal, T ax and Regulatory Risks
Taxes aimed at our products can adversely af fect our business or financial performance.
Certain jurisdictions  in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on
the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of ingredients contained in
our products. These taxes vary in scope  and form: some apply to all beverage s, including non-caloric beverages, while others
apply only to bevera ges with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly , some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on
beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a graduated tax rate depending upon
the amoun t of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any
amount of added sugar (or other swee tener). For example, Italy enacted a flat tax on all beverages, including zero calorie
beverages, effective January 1, 2023, at a rate of EUR 10 cent (0.11 U.S. dollars) per liter. These tax measures, whatever their
scope or form, have  in the past and could continue to increase the cost of certai n of our products, reduce overall consumption of
our products or lead to negative publicity , resulting in an adverse ef fect on our business and financial performance.

Table of Contents
Limitations on the marketing or sale of our products can adversely af fect our business and financial performance.
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, limitations on the
marketing or sale of our products as a result of ingredients or substances in our products. These limitations require that we
highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present
in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products
may be available. For example, Brazil and Canada enacted warning labeling requirements in 2022 to indicate whether a particular
pre-packaged food or beverage produc t is considered to be high in sugar , sodium or saturated fat. Certain jurisdictions have
imposed or are considering imposing color -coded labeling requirements where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to
indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar , sodium or saturated fat, in products. The imposition or proposed
imposition of additional limitations on the marketing or sale of our products has in the past and could continue to reduce overall
consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet
their health and wellness needs, resulting in an adverse ef fect on our business and financial performance.
Laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packa ging materials can adversely affect our business
and financial performance.
We rely on diverse packaging solutions  to safely deliver products to our custom ers and consumers. Certain of our products are
sold in packaging designed to be recyclable, commercially compostable, biodegradable or reusable. However , not all packaging is
recovered, whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise, and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable,
commercially compostable, biodegradable or reusable. Packaging waste not properly disposed of that displays one or more of our
brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity , litigation, government action or reduced
consumer demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial performance. Many jurisdictions in which our products are
sold have imposed or are considering imposing laws, regulations or policie s intended to encourage the use of sustainable
packaging, waste reduction or increased recycling rates or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These laws,
regulations and policies vary in form and scope and include extended producer responsibility policies, plastic or packaging taxes,
restrictions on certain products and mate rials, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles, restrictions or bans on the use
of certain types of packaging, including single-use plastics and packaging containing PFAS, restrictions on labeling related to
recyclability and requirements to charge deposit fees. For example, the European Union, Peru and certain states in the United
States, among other jurisdictions, have  imposed a minimum recycled content  requirement for beverage bottle packaging and
similar legislation is under consideration in other jurisdictions. These laws and regulations have in the past and could continue to
increase the cost of our products, impact demand for our products, result in negative publicity and require us and our business
partners, including our independent bottlers, to increase capital expenditures to invest in reducing the amount of virgin plastic or
other mate rials used in our packaging, to develop alternative packaging or to revise product labeling, all of which can adversely
affect our business and financial performance.
Failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely af fect our business.
We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding
personal data protec tion and privacy laws. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to
country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Our efforts to
comply with these laws and regulations,  including the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was significantly modified by the
California Privacy Rights Act, as well as new comprehensive privacy legislation passed in Virginia, Colorado, Utah and
Connecticut, as well as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and China's Personal Information Protection
Act, impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to
21
Table of Contents
continue to increase over time, particularly as additional jurisdictions continue to adopt similar regulations. Failure to comply
with these laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal data from unau thorized access, use or other processing, have in
the past and could in the future result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, damage to
our reputation, fines or penalties, all of which can adversely af fect our business.
Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreement s with tax authorities can adversely affect our
financial performance.
Increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced,
can advers ely affect our financial perfor mance. For example, economic and political conditions in countries where we are subject
to taxes, including the United States, have in the past and could continue to result in significant changes in tax legislation or
regulation. For example, numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development model rules that propose a partial global profit reallocation and a global minimum tax rate of 15%
and Europ ean Union member states have recently agreed to implement the global minimum tax. There can be no assurance that
other indiv idual countries will adopt these changes, or that once adopted by any country , that these changes will not have adverse
effects on our financial performance. This increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to
increase tax uncertainty , resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also
subject to regular reviews, examinations  and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based
taxes. Economic and political pressures  to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or
reformed tax legisla tion or regulation, has made and could continue to make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final
resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical  provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse
effect on our financial performance.
If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are found to infringe on the intellectual
property rights of others, our business can be adversely af fected.
We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, includ ing ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights,
patents, business processes and other trade secrets. The laws of various jurisdict ions in which we operate have differing levels of
protection of intellectual property . Our competitive position and the value of our products and brands can be reduced and our
business adversely affected if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property , including our ingredient formulas,
or if there is a change in law that limits  or removes the current legal protections afforded our intellectual property . Also, in the
course of developin g new products or improving the quality of existing products, we have in the past been alleged to have
infringed, and could in the future infringe or be alleged to infringe, on the intellectual property rights of others. Such
infringement or allegations of infringement could result in expensive litigation and damages, damage to our reputation, disruption
to our operations, injunctions against development, manufacturing, use and/or sale of certain products, inventory write-of fs or
other limitations on our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products, resulting in an adverse
effect on our business.
Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business can adversely af fect our business.
The condu ct of our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale,
display , advertising, marketing, labelin g, content (including whether a produ ct contains genetically engineered ingredients),
quality , safety , transportation, traceability , sourcing (including pesticide use),  packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our
products or raw materials, employment and occupational health and safety , environmental, social and governance matters and
reporting (including climate change) and data privacy and protection. In addition, in many jurisdictions,
22
Table of Contents
compliance with competition and antitrust laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position, as is compliance
with anti-corruption laws. The imposition of new laws, changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations
thereof, changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the
markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distribut ed or sold, have in the past and could continue to
result in higher compliance costs, capit al expenditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate
certain of our produ cts, resulting in adverse effects on our business. For exampl e, increasing governmental and societal attention
to environmental, social and governance matters has resulted and could continue to result in new laws or regulatory requirements,
including expanded disclosure requirem ents that are expected to continue to expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters
on which we are required to report. In addition, the entry into new markets or categories, including our recent entry into the
alcoholic beverage industry as a distribu tor, has resulted in and could continue to result in our business being subject to additional
regulations resulting in higher compliance costs. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new laws or regulations that
impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, other jurisdictions may follow . Failure to comply with such laws or
regulations (or allegations thereof) can subject us to criminal or civil investigations or enforcement actions, including voluntary
and involuntary document requests, fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgor gement of profits or activity restrictions,
all of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid)
purporting to assess the health implicati ons of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products
or packaging materials have resulted in and could continue to result in our being  subject to new taxes and regulations or lawsuits
that can adversely af fect our business.
Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an
adverse impact on our business.
We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations,
including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and
ingredients, personal injury and property damage, intellectual property rights, privacy , employment, tax and insurance matters,
environmental, social and governance matters and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These
matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment
of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the
ultimate outcome of such matters. Responding to these matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to
incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or
brand image. Any of the foregoing can adversely af fect our business.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
We have received no written comments  regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180
days or more preceding the end of our 2022 year and that remain unresolved.

contract manufactur ers, co-packers, strategic alliances or joint ventures in which we have an equity interest. We believe that our

our current operations.
Item 3. Legal Pr oceedings.
We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations.

certainty , management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

OUR BUSINESS
Executive Overview
PepsiCo is a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Lay’s,
Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola , Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream. Through our operations, authorized bottlers,
contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient
foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.
As a global company with deep local ties, we faced many of the same challenges in 2022 as our consumers, customers, and
competitors across the world, including supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and
behaviors; another year of the COVID-19 pandemic; a worsening climate crisis; a highly competitive operating environment; a
rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility ,
including the deadly conflict in Ukraine; and an evolving regulatory landscape.
To meet the challenges of today – and those of tomorrow – we are driven by an approach called pep+ (PepsiCo Positive). pep+ is
a strategic  end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability and human capital at the center of how the company will
strive to create grow th and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and
people. pep+ guides how we are workin g to transform our business operations, from sourcing ingredients and making and selling
products in a more sustainable way, to leveraging our more than one billion  connections with consumers each day to take
sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet.
pep+ drive s action and progress across three key pillars, bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals
under a comprehensive framework:
•Positive Agricultur e: We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the earth across seven million acres of
land, an area approximately equal to our entire agricultural footprint, sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and
improve the liveliho ods of more peopl e in our agricultural supply chain. In 2022, we elevated a number of external
strategic partnership s and key engage ments with this focus, including a partnership with Archer Daniels Midland
Company (ADM) to scale regenerative  agriculture across our shared supply chains, up to 2 million acres; a research
agreement with MIT to develop a more precise measurement of the greenhouse gas impact of regenerative agriculture
practices; a strategic engagement with Corteva focused on agriculture sustainability , new substrates, and affordability in
food corn and vegetable oils; and a joint effort with a start-up called N-Drip to scale advantaged micro irrigation
technology that can provide water -saving, crop-enhancing benefits to farmers around the world.

Table of Contents
•Positive Value Chain : We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to: achieve net-zero
emissions by 2040; become net water positive by 2030; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain.
Our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving, using more recycled content in our plastic packaging, and
scaling our SodaStream business globally , potentially eliminating the need for more than 200 billion plastic bottles by
2030. In 2022, we also announced a new global packaging goal intended to double the percentage of all beverage servings
delivered through reusable models from 10% to 20% by 2030. Additionally , we are making progress on our diversity ,
equity and inclusion journey around the world. And we continue to empower each one of our approximately 315,000
employees to make a positive impact in their communities through our global workforce volunteering program, One
Smile at a T ime.
•Positive Choices : We continue working to evolve our portfolio of convenient food & beverage products so that they are
better for the planet and people, including by incorporating more diverse ingre dients in both new and existing products,
prioritizing chickpeas, plant-based proteins and whole grains; expanding our position in the nuts & seeds category;
accelerating our reduction of added sugars and sodium through the use of scien ce-based targets across our portfolio; and
offering more products with healthier oils. We are also continuing to scale new business models that require little or no
single-use packaging, including the iconic SodaStream, already sold in more than 45 countries, and the new SodaStream
Professional platform, allowing users to personalize their choices in reusable containers at home or on the go.
We believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth.
See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces.
Our Operations
See “Item 1. Busine ss” for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other
supplies, brands and intellectual prope rty rights, seasonality , customers, competition, research and development, regulatory
matters and human capital. In addition, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our
divisions and geographic areas.
Other Relationships
Certain members of our Board also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not
participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negot iations. Our transactions with these vendors and
customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In
addition, certain of our employees serve  on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Venture s LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo
and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.
Our Business Risks
Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain
During 2022, we continued to experience significantly higher operating costs, including on transportation, labor and commodity
(including energy) costs, which we expect to continue in 2023. Many of the commodities used in the production and
transportation of our products are purch ased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and
we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase order s, pricing agreements and derivative instruments,
including swaps and futures. A number of external factors, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic,
the inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions
31
Table of Contents
(including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation, labor and
commodity availabi lity and costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without
suffering reduced volume, revenue, mar gins and operating results.
See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity
prices.
Risks Associated with Climate Change
Certain jurisdictions in which our produ cts are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering
imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change,
including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or
regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could result in significant increased costs and
additional investmen ts in facilities and equipment. However , we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or
increased environme ntal laws and regul ations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on
our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which
our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the
unfavorable impact, if any , of such laws or regulations.
Risks Associated with International Operations
We are subject to risks in the normal course of business that are inherent to international operations. During the periods presented
in this report, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in certain
developing and emer ging markets, operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social
conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters , debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. We continue to monitor the
economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely , includ ing risks of additional impairments or write-of fs,
and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment charges recognized in the year ended
December 31, 2022 .
Risks Associated with the Deadly Conflict in Ukraine
In addition  to the risks associated with international operations discussed above, we continue to face risks associated with the
deadly conflict in Ukraine. The conflict has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty , and
certain of our operations in Ukraine remain suspended. We have suspended sales to our custom ers of Pepsi-Cola and certain of
our other global beverage brands, our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in Russia,
which has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business. We continue to offer our other products in
Russia. Our operations in Russia accou nted for 5% and 4% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31,
2022 and December  25, 2021, respective ly. Russ ia accounted for 4% and 5% of our consolidated assets, including 9% and 1% of
our consolidated cash and cash equival ents, and 32% and 35% of our accumulated currency translation adjustment loss as of
December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively . Our operations in Ukraine accounted for 0.2% and 0.5% of our
consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively . Ukraine accounted for
0.1% and 0.3% of our consolidated assets as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively .
32
Table of Contents
The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of
cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risks, heightened risks to employee safety , business
disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and
other corporate banking services, includ ing working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation,
energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining
facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds
to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets or additional impairment
charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will contin ue to affect our employees, customers, operations
or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could
continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial
statements for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including impairment charges, recognized in the year ended
December 31, 2022 .
The extent of the impact of these tragic events on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous
evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the conflic t, regional instability
and ongoing and additional financial and economic sanctions, export controls and other legislation imposed by governments. We
will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any
unfavorable impacts on our future results.
Imposition of T axes and Regulations on our Products
Certain jurisdictions in which our produ cts are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering
imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging,
ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of
our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our pack aging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope
and form. For exam ple, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric  beverages, while others apply only to beverages
with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Further , some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g.,
plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling
rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging.
We sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the
products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction.
Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulati ons or other limitations on our products or their
packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In
addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently . We continue to monitor existing and
proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to
consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations,
including advocating alternative measu res with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or
limitations.
Retail Landscape
Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the continued growth in sales through e-
commerce websites and mobile comme rce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and
digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discou nters. We have seen and expect to continue to see
a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-
33
Table of Contents
offline and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor
changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities,
such as expanding our direct-to-consum er business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emer ging
channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks
and the actions we have taken to address key challenges.
Risk Management Framework
The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves risks, many of which evolve over time. To identify , assess,
prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’ s operations and foster a corporate culture
of integrity and risk awareness, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following:
•PepsiCo’ s Board has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’ s integrated risk management framework. One of the Board’ s
primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the
Company’ s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’ s top risks. Throughout the year, the
Board and relevant Committees of the Board receive updates from management with respect to various enterprise risk
management issues and dedicate a portion of their meetings to reviewing and discussing specific risk topics in greater
detail, including risks related to cybersecurity , food safety , sustainability , human capital management (including
diversity , equity and inclusion) and supply chain and commodity inflation. The Board receives and provides feedback on
regular updates from  management regarding the Company’ s top risks, including  updates from members of management
responsible for overseeing impacted areas (for example, the Global Chief Information Officer and Chief Information
Security Officer), governance processes  associated with managing these risks , the status of projects to strengthen the
Company’ s risk mitigation efforts and recent incidents impacting the industry and threat landscape. Given that
cybersecurity risks can impact various areas of responsibility of the Committees of the Board, the Board believes it is
useful and effective for the full Board to maintain direct oversight over cybersecurity matters. In evaluating top risks, the
Board and management consider short-,  medium- and long-term potential impacts on the Company’ s business, financial
condition and results of operations, including looking at the internal and external environment when evaluating risks, risk
amplifiers and emer ging trends, and considers the risk horizon as part of prioritizing the Company’ s risk mitigation
efforts. The Board receives updates through presentations, memos and other written materials, teleconferences and other
appropriate means of communication, with numerous opportunities for discussion and feedback, and continuously
evaluates its approach in addressing top risks as circumstances evolve. For example, as part of risk updates to the Board
and relevant Committees during 2022, the Board or its relevant Committee were provided updates on the impact of
disruptive events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, COVID-19 and supply chain disruption and commodity inflation.
The Board  also receives periodic updates from external experts and advisers on global macroeconomic trends and
conditions that may impact the Company’ s strategy and financial performance, including geopolitical conflicts, economic
instability , labor market trends, changing consumer behavior , retail disruption and digitalization.
The Board has taske d designated Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and
the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters.
◦The Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’ s risk
management and oversight processes, and assists the Board’ s
34
Table of Contents
oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo. The Audit Committee also assists
the Board’ s oversight of the Company ’s compliance with legal and regulat ory requirements and the Chief
Compliance & Ethics Officer, who reports to the General Counsel, meets regularly with the Audit Committee,
including in executive session without management present;
◦The Comp ensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’ s employee compensation policies and practices to
assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior;
◦The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’ s
governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and
◦The Sustainability , Diversity and Public Policy Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of
PepsiCo’ s policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainabi lity (including climate change),
diversity , equity and inclusion, and public policy matters.
•The Pepsi Co Risk Committee (PRC) meets regularly to identify , assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial,
operating, compliance, safety , reputational and other risks. The PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk
mitigation efforts to the Board. The PRC  is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management
group, including PepsiCo’ s Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer,
General Counsel, Sector Chief Executive Officers and the heads of Corporate Affairs, Human Resources, Research &
Development, Information Technology , Sustainability , Strategy , Transformation, International Beverages, Commercial,
Global Operations, Marketing and Financial Planning & Analysis;
•Division and key market risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to
identify , assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks;
•PepsiCo’ s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk managem ent process, provides ongoing guidance,
tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses
potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCo’ s Board, the Audit
Committee of the Board and other Committees of the Board;
•PepsiCo’ s Internal Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic
audit and review procedures; and
•PepsiCo’ s Compliance & Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices.
•PepsiCo’ s Disclosur e Committee, comprised of the General Counsel, Controller and heads of Internal Audit, Financial
Planning & Analysis and Investor Relations, evaluates information from PepsiCo’ s integrated risk management
framework as part of the Disclosure Committee’ s monitoring of the integrity and effectiveness of the Company’ s
disclosure controls and procedures. PepsiCo’ s risk oversight processes and disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to appropriately escalate key risks to the Board as well as to analyze potential risks for disclosure.

Market Risks
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal cours e of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of
strategies, including  productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve
the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of
derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See
“Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of our market risks.
The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market
fluctuations is discussed below . See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and
our hedgi ng policie s. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets  is impacted by changes in market conditions,
including interest rates and inflationary , deflationary and recessionary conditions. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates” for a discussion of the exposure of our goodwill and other intang ible assets and pension and retiree medical plan
assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.
Inflationary , deflatio nary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our
products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.
Commodity Prices
Our comm odity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $1.6 billion as of
December 25, 2021. At the end of 2022,  the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10%
decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2022 by $176 million, which
would generally be of fset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.
Foreign Exchange
Our operations outside of the United States generated 43% of our consolida ted net revenue in 2022, with Mexico, Russia,
Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively , comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net
revenue in 2022. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are
made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally , we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign
subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During
2022, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 3 percentage points, primarily due to declines in the Turkish
lira, euro, Egyptian pound, British pound sterling and South African rand, partially offset by an appreciation of the Russian ruble.
Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not of fset could adversely impact our future financial results.
In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine,
and curren cy controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or
increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these internati onal markets may, result in challenging operating
environments.
36
Table of Contents
Our foreig n currency derivatives had a total notional value of $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.8 billion as of
December 25, 2021. At the end of 2022 , we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would
have decre ased our net unrealized gains in 2022 by $298 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the
fair value of the underlying exposure.
The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2022

Our intere st rate derivatives had a total notional value of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.1 billion as of
December 25, 2021.  Assuming year-end 2022 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest
rates woul d have decreased our net interest expense in 2022 by $48 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-
term investments levels, as compared with our variable rate debt.
OUR FINANCIAL RESUL TS
Results of Operations — Consolidated Review
Volume
Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions,
including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume
provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and
provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer
level. Beginning in 2022, unit volume growth adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes.
Further , our fiscal 2022 results include an additional week (53 reporting week). Unit volume growth excludes the impact of the
53 reporting week.
Beverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company-
owned or licensed trademarks and allied brand products and joint venture trademarks sold by company-owned bottling
operations. Beverage volume also includes volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks sold by
our noncontrolled af filiates. Concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents
(CSE), whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (BCS). Both CSE and BCS convert all
beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically , CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due to seasonality , timing
of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net revenue is not entirely based on
BCS volum e due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that BCS is a better measure of the consumption of
our beverage products. PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with third parties,
make, market, distribute and sell ready -to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand
name), and PBNA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink
coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks.
Convenient food volume includes volume sold by us and our noncontrolled affiliates of convenient food products bearing
company-owned or licensed trademark s. Internationally , we measure convenient food product volume in kilograms, while in
North America we measure convenient food product volume in pounds. FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells Sabra
refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with Strauss Group.rd

Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit
 2022 2021 Change
Net revenue $ 86,392 $ 79,474 9 %
Operating profit $ 11,512 $ 11,162 3 %
Operating margin 13.3 % 14.0 % (0.7)
See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.
Operating profit grew 3% while operating margin declined 0.7 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven
by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 42-percentage-point
impact of higher commodity costs. The loss of net revenue due to the Juice Transaction reduced operating profit growth by 3
percentage points and was partially of fset by a 1-percentage-point contribution from the 53  reporting week.
Operating profit growth also reflects a 13-percentage-point unfavorable impact of impairment charges related to certain
indefinite-lived intan gible assets due to an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates
of future financial performance (other impairment charges), a 12-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the charges associated
with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a 6-percentage-point unfavorable impact of impairment on intangible assets, investment and
property , plant and equipment and other charges as a result of management’ s decision to reposition or discontinue the
sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment (brand portfolio impairment charges). These impacts were partially
offset by a 29-percentage-point contribution from the gain associated with the Juice T ransaction.
The operating margin decline primarily reflects the unfavorable impacts of other impairment charges, the charges associated with
the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the brand portfolio impairment charges, partially offset by the gain associated with the Juice
Transaction.
Juice Transaction
In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39%
noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. These juice businesses delivered approximately $3
billion in net revenu e in 2021. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBG’ s portfolio of brands for
small-format and foodservice customers with chilled DSD. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further
information.

Annual tax rate 16.1 % 21.8 %
Net income attributable to PepsiCo $ 8,910 $ 7,618 17 %
Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted $ 6.42 $ 5.49 17 %
Other pension and retiree medical benefits income decreased $390 million, primarily due to higher settlement losses compared to
the prior year .
Net interest expense and other decreased $924 million, reflecting the prior -year charge of $842 million related to our cash tender
offers, higher interest rates on average cash balances and lower average debt balances, partially offset by losses on the market
value of investments used to economic ally hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability and higher interest rates on
debt.rd

The reported tax rate decreased 5.7 percentage points, primarily reflecting the impact of the Juice Transaction and adjustments to
reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit.

See “Our Business Risks,” “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider
when evaluating our results and relate d information regarding measures not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP).
In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below , “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over -year impact of discrete
pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in
different countries. Additionally , “acquisitions and divestitures” reflect mergers and acquisitions activity , as well as divestitures
and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity
investees.

decline in variety packs, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in trademark Doritos and double-digit growth in trademark
Popcorners.
Operating profit increased 9%, primar ily reflecting the effective net pricing and productivity savings. These impacts were
partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives, a 17-percentage-point impact of higher
commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, potatoes and seasoning, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally ,
impairment charges associated with a baked fruit convenient food brand reduced operating profit growth by 1.5 percentage points
(other impairment char ges). The 53  reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth.

Net revenu e increased 4%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and an increase in organic volume. The 53 reporting week
contributed 2 percentage points to net revenue growth offset by a 9-percentage-point unfavorable impact  of lower net revenue
due to the Juice T ransaction.
Unit volume grew slightly , driven by a 1% increase in our NCB volume, offset by a 1% decrease in CSD volume. The NCB
volume increase primarily reflected a mid-single-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks, partially offset by a double-digit
decrease in our ener gy portfolio.
Operating profit increased 122%, primarily reflecting a 124-percentage-point impact of the gain of $3.0 billion associated with
the Juice Transaction, partially offset by a 2-percentage-point impact of related transaction costs.  Operating profit growth was
also driven by the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including
incremental transportation and information technology costs, and a 42-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs,
primarily aluminum and resin. A current-year gain associated with the sale of an asset and the 53 reporting week contributed 6
percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively , to operating profit growth. Additionally , operating profit growth was
reduced by a 15-percentage-point impact of the lower net revenue due to the Juice T ransaction.
As a result of our decision to terminate the agreement with Vital Pharmaceu ticals, Inc. to distribute Bang energy drinks, we
recorded impairment and other related charges which reduced operating profit growth by 7 percentage points (brand portfolio

Non-GAAP Measur es
Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with
GAAP . We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of
our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain
employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to facilitate
comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency
on how we evaluate  our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our
performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.
We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or
that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we
may make  adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring
plans; charges associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; gains associated with divestitures;
asset impa irment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts (including all settlement and curtailment gains
and losses); charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts
related to the resolu tion of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations  of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender
or exchange offers; and remeasurement s of net monetary assets. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, certain immaterial pension
and retire e medical -related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items affecting comparability .
Pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs
continue to be reflected in our core results. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to
our GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. 
Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP . In addition, our non-GAAP financial
measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.
The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-K are discussed below:
Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment
of intangible assets, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, net interest expense and other , provision for income taxes,
net income attributable to noncontr olling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting
comparability , operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items
affecting comparability , and the corr esponding constant curr ency gr owth rates
These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do
not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan (2019
Productivity Plan), charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction,
impairment and other char ges

comprised of Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges, the impact of
settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans, a charge related to cash tender offers, tax
benefit related to the IRS audit and tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) (see “Items Affecting
Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net
income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjus ted for items affecting comparability , on a constant
currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based
on the rates in effect for the comparab le prior -year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or
divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or
divide, as appropriat e, those amounts by the prior -year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful
information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing
performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year .
Organic r evenue gr owth
We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impac ts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions,
divestitures and other structural changes , and every five or six years, the impact of the 53 reporting week, including in our 2022
financial results. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects mergers and acquisitions activity , including the impact in
2021 of an extra month of net revenue for our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods in our AMESA division and Be & Cheery in our
APAC division as we aligned the reporting calendars of these acquisitions with those of our divisions, as well as divestitures and
other struc tural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity
investees. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it
excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior
year.
See “Net Revenue and Or ganic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information.
Free cash flow
We define  free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property , plant and
equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational
capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net
capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and
financing activities,  including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash
available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not
deducted from the measure.
See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.
Return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability
We define ROIC as net income attribut able to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average
debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders’ equity . Although  ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous
methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly , the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the
methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.
We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC,
excluding items affecting comparability , to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because
it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and
reflects how management evaluates ourrd
45
Table of Contents
operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability , as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly
average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest  income and items affecting comparability . We
believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability , provides useful information to investors
and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation ef ficiency .
See “Return on Invested Capital” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.

Mark-to-Market Net Impact
We centrally manage commodity deriv atives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural
products, energy and metals. Commodi ty derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market
each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unalloc ated expenses as either cost of sales or selling,
general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected
in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions
realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in
corporate unallocated expenses.

Table of Contents
implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end
of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-
tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. Plan to date through
December 31, 2022, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.5 billion, includin g cash expenditures of $1.0 billion. In our 2023
financial results, we expect to incur pre-tax charges and cash expenditures of approximately  $600 million  each. These charges
will be funded prima rily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash
expenditures in our 2023 through 2024 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2028. Char ges include severance
and other employee costs, asset impairments and other costs.
See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly
evaluate productivity initiatives beyon d the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our
consolidated financial statements.
Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges
Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the
acquisition-date balance sheets (recorded in cost of sales), merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures
(recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support
socioeconomic programs in South Africa, gains associated with contingent consideration, employee-related costs, contract
termination costs, closing costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related  charges reflect transaction expenses, including
consulting, advisory and other professional fees.
See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Gain Associated with the Juice T ransaction
We recognized a gain associated with the Juice T ransaction in our PBNA and Europe divisions.
See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Impairment and Other Charges
We recogn ized Russ ia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described
below .
Russia-Ukraine Conflict Char ges
In connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and
property , plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs.
See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Brand Portfolio Impairment Char ges
We recogn ized intangible asset, investment and property , plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result of
management’ s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment.
See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Other Impairment Char ges
We recogn ized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflect an increase in the
weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future financial performance.
See Notes 1 and 4 to  our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact
Pension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the
total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.
See Notes 7 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.    
Charge Related to Cash T ender Of fers
As a result of the cash tender offers for some of our long-term debt, we recorde d a charge primarily representing the tender price
paid over the carryin g value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks  used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash
tender of fers.
See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Tax Benefit Related to the IRS Audit
We recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014
through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Tax Expense Related to the TCJ Act
Tax expense related to the TCJ Act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Our Liquidity and Capital Resour ces
We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working
capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing,
will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, includin g with respect to our net capital spending plans.
Our prima ry sources of liquidity include cash from operations, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion from the Juice
Transaction,  proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These
sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments
and relate d interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual
commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash
fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-
balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our
liquidity . See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further
information.

Table of Contents
Our sourc es and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and, to date, we have not
identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the conflict. Based on the information currently available to us, we do
not expect the impa ct of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to have a material impact on our future liquidity . We will continue to
monitor and assess the impact the Russ ia-Ukraine conflict may have on our business and financial results. See “Item 1A. Risk
Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact
of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business and financial results.
As of December 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency
controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.
The TCJ Act impose d a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of December 31, 2022, our
mandatory transition  tax liability was $2.6 billion, which must be paid throug h 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we
currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2023. Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may
impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability . See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further
discussion of the TCJ Act.
As part of our evolv ing market practices, we work with our suppliers to optim ize our terms and conditions, which include the
extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days,
which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working
with our suppliers to adjust as necessary . We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating
global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts
receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements
is voluntary . Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we
are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’ s
creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which gene rally provides our suppliers with more favorable
terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any
third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to
participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not
impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts
payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We were informed by the participating financial
institutions that as of both December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, $1.5 billion of our accounts payable to suppliers who
participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding. These supply chain finance arrangements did not have a material
impact on our liquidity or capital resour ces in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material
impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality . Working capital needs are
impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and
generally lowest in the first quarter . On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and
enhance our business results, including  acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and
other ef ficiency initiatives and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.

Net cash used for investing activities $ (2,430) $ (3,269)
Net cash used for financing activities $ (8,523) $(10,780)
Operating Activities
In 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.8 billion, compared to $11.6 billion in the prior year. The decrease in
operating cash flow primarily reflects unfavorable working capital comparisons and higher net cash tax payments, partially offset
by favorable operating profit performance and lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year .
Investing Activities
In 2022, net cash used for investing activities was $2.4 billion, primarily reflec ting net capital spending of $5.0 billion and our
investment in Celsius Holdings, Inc. (Celsius) convertible preferred stock and agreement to distribute Celsius energy drinks of
$0.8 billion, partially of fset by proceeds associated with the Juice T ransaction of $3.5 billion.
In 2021, net cash used for investing activities was $3.3 billion, primarily reflec ting net capital spending of $4.5 billion, partially
offset by maturities of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion.
See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Notes 4 and 9 to
our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our agreement with and investment in Celsius; and see Note 13 to
our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our acquisitions.
We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the
Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business, and believe that we have suf ficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs.
Financing Activities
In 2022, net cash used for financing activities was $8.5 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our
shareholders through dividend payments of $6.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.5 billion, payments of long-term debt
borrowings of $2.5 billion and debt redemptions/cash tender offers of $1.7 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of
long-term debt of $3.4 billion.
In 2021, net cash used for financing activities was $10.8 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our
shareholders largely through dividend payments of $5.8 billion, cash tender offers/debt redemption of $4.8 billion, payments of
long-term debt borrowings of $3.5 billio n and payments of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $0.8 billion, partially
offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $4.1 billion.
See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations.
We annually review our capital structu re with our Board, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity . On
February 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of PepsiCo
common stock which commenced on February 11, 2022 and will expire on February 28, 2026. In addition, on February 9, 2023,
we announ ced a 10.0% increase in our annualized dividend to $5.06 per share from $4.60 per share, effective with the dividend
expected to be paid in June 2023. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2023, comprising
dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.0 billion.

Free Cash Flow
The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash

Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 5,855 $ 7,157 (18)%
We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share
repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our share holders primarily through dividends and share
repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility
and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates.  However , see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our
Business Risks” for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.
Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency , especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or
not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our
ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our
current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we
have experienced historically , and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See
“Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMA TES
An appreciation of our critical accounting policies and estimates is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies
may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, including the business and
economic uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, and
as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of
future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. We applied our critical accounting
policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical
accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee.(a)
(b)
54
Table of Contents
Our critical accounting policies and estimates are:
•revenue recognition;
•goodwill and other intangible assets;
•income tax expense and accruals; and
•pension and retiree medical plans.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and
sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is
also when  control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our custom ers is typically based on written sales terms that
do not allow for a right of return. However , our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace
damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they
expect. Similarly , our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a
result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date produc ts.
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days
internationally , and may allow discounts for early payment.
We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility ,
write-of f history , the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the
expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment) , leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and
projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.
Our policy  is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our comm itment to freshness and product dating serves to
regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with
customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks,
we monitor customer inventory levels.
As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to
customers and consumers. Total marke tplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing
activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to
customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new
products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include
support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.
A number  of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on
annual targets, and accruals are establish ed during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur
after year-end once reconciled and settle d. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar
programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating custom er and consumer participation and performance
levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in
earnings in the period such differences  are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on
annual tar gets and recognized during the year as incurred.
55
Table of Contents
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies,
including total marketplace spending.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were develop ed by us. Brand development costs are expensed
as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions . In a business combination, the consideration is
first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values,
with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires signifi cant estimates and assumptions, including those
related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary  cost environment, based on an evaluation of a
number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and
future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the
intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria
are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which gene rally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the
expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market
share, consumer awareness, brand history , future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the
macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.
In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights
to manufacture and/or distribute beverag es for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights,
many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arran gements, the indefinite period expected for these
franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these
franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these
franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the
remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually ,
using either a qualitative or quantitati ve approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter , or more
frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment,
first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include
macroeconomic conditions (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary cost
environment), indus try and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and
significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an
impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair
value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively . Estimated fair value is determined using
discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with
management’ s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetu ity growth assumptions and the selection of
assumptions underly ing a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant
management judgme nt is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including
those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high
56
Table of Contents
interest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of sales , operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions
used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including
perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are
consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our
results. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks  described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our
Business Risks.”
In 2022, we recorded $1.3 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax or $0.78 per share) of indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment
charges related to the SodaStream brand in Europe. As a result, its carrying value as of December 31, 2022 is equal to its fair
value and the brand is at a heightened  risk of future impairment if certain assumptions and estimates were to change. For
example, a mutually exclusive 100-basis-point increase in the discount rate and a 100-basis-point decrease in the perpetuity
growth rate used to estimate the fair value of the SodaStream brand would result in an additional estimated impairment charge of
approximately $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively . We will continue to monitor the performance of the SodaStream brand
and goodwill, as well as all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its
estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
See Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Income T ax Expense and Accruals
Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing
arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our
annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are
fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these
reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax
laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.
An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual
item recognized in our quarterly operat ing results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the
same time as that item. W e consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior -year tax matters to be among such items.
Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial
statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our
tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return,
and some difference s reverse over time,  such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future
years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation
allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferre d tax assets will be realized.  Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated
financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax
return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.

In 2022, our annual tax rate was 16.1% compared to 21.8% in 2021. See “Other Consolidated Results” for further information.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Pension and Retir ee Medical Plans
Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined
based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also
eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally , our share
of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing
the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.
See “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about changes and
settlements within our pension plans.
Our Assumptions
The determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the
amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree
medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working
during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligatio n due to the passage of time (interest cost), and
(3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on
assets for our funded plans.
Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:
•certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover , retirement age and mortality;
•the expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans;
•the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities;
•for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and
•for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates.
Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’ s best judgment regarding future expectations. All
actuarial assumption s are reviewed annually , except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a
curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact
on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.
At each measurement date, the discount  rates are based on interest rates for high-quality , long-term corporate debt securities with
maturities comparab le to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the
discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and
amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial  statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’
investment strategy . Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given
year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.
58
Table of Contents
The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans’ obligation and expense is reviewed annually . Our review is
based on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care
industry . Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and
changes in medical carriers.
Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows:  
2023 2022 2021
Pension
Service cost discount rate 5.5 % 3.2 % 2.6 %
Interest cost discount rate 5.4 % 2.9 % 1.9 %
Expected rate of return on plan assets 7.0 % 6.3 % 6.2 %
Expected rate of salary increases 3.3 % 3.1 % 3.1 %
Retiree medical
Service cost discount rate 5.4 % 2.8 % 2.3 %
Interest cost discount rate 5.3 % 2.1 % 1.6 %
Expected rate of return on plan assets 7.1 % 5.7 % 5.4 %
Current health care cost trend rate 5.5 % 5.8 % 5.5 %
(a) 2022 rates reflect remeasurement of a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in the second quarter of 2022.
In 2022, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered pre-tax settlement charges for
certain U.S defined pension plans. In addition, we expect the recognition of fixed income losses on plan assets, partially offset by
higher discount rates, to increase our pension and retiree medical expense in 2023.
Sensitivity of Assumptions
A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our
benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would
individually increase 2023 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:
Assumption Amount
Discount rates used in the calculation of expense $ 13 
Expected rate of return $ 38 
Funding
We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain  pension plans. These contributions are made in
accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the
employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally , we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be
currently tax deduct ible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulato ry funding requirements, we generally fund these
plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these
benefits.
We made a discretionary contribution of $125 million to a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan in January 2023 and expect to make
an additional $125 million in the third quarter of 2023.
Our pensio n and retiree medical plan contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest
rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate
different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our
consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.(a)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 — Basis of Pr esentation and Our Divisions
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financi al statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the consolidated
accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other
affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the
operating or financial decisions of these  affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other
affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are
eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restriction s, we do not have control over our Venezuelan
subsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period
presented.
Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production
planning, inspection  costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and
delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in
determining, among  other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical
accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-
lived intan gible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical
experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumst ances, such as current economic conditions, and
adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. Additionally , the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the
Russia -Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment has made such estimates and assumptions
more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ
significantly from those estimates.
Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December , resulting in a 53  reporting week every five or six years, including in
our 2022 financial results. While our North America financial results are reporte d on a weekly calendar basis, substantially all of
our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021. Beginning in the fourth
quarter of 2021, all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis. This change did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for 2022, reflecting
the additional week in the fourth quarter:
Quarter United States and Canada International
First Quarter 12 weeks January , February
Second Quarter 12 weeks March, April and May
Third Quarter 12 weeks June, July and August
Fourth Quarter 17 weeks September , October , November and December
Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share
amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to
the prior year ’s consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.rd

Our Divisions
We are or ganized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows:
1)Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and
Canada;
2)Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta
and other branded food, in the United States and Canada;
3)PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada;
4)Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America;
5)Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe;
6)Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in
Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and
7)Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient
food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region.
Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a
wide variety of beverages and convenien t foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with
our lar gest operations in the United States, Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa.
The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation
methodologies:
•share-based compensation expense;
•pension and retiree medical expense; and
•derivatives.
Share-Based Compensation Expense
Our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our
divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost.
The allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows:
2022 2021 2020
FLNA 13 % 13 % 13 %
QFNA 1 % 1 % 1 %
PBNA 20 % 19 % 18 %
LatAm 6 % 5 % 6 %
Europe 11 % 13 % 16 %
AMESA 5 % 6 % 6 %
APAC 3 % 2 % 2 %
Corporate unallocated expenses 41 % 41 % 38 %
The expen se allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market
conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual
expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.
67
Table of Contents
Pension and Retir ee Medical Expense
Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between
the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7
is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.
Derivatives
We centra lly manag e commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural
products, energy and metals. Commodi ty derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market
each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unalloc ated expenses as either cost of sales or selling,
general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected
in division  results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions
realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in
corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading
or speculative purposes.
Net Revenue and Operating Profit/(Loss)
Net revenue and operating profit/(loss) of each division are as follows:
 Net Revenue Operating Profit/(Loss)

Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and
sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is
also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are
accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling,
general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. In addition, we
exclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue
producing transactions.
The transf er of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of
return. However , our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date
products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product qualit y and freshness they expect. Similarly , our policy
for certain warehouse-distributed products(a)
(b)
(c)
72
Table of Contents
is to repla ce damage d and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and
out-of-date produc ts.
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days
internationally , and may allow discounts for early payment.
We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility ,
write-of f history , the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the
expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment) , leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and
projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.
We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. We have not experienced credit
issues with these customers. In 2022, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam’ s) represented approximately 14% of our
consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by
them to W almart.
Total Marketplace Spending
We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending
includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily
accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as
payments for in-store displays, payment s to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote
lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of
advertising and other marketing activities.
A number  of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on
annual targets, and accruals are establish ed during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur
after year-end once reconciled and settle d. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar
programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating custom er and consumer participation and performance
levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in
earnings in the period such differences  are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on
annual tar gets and recognized during the year as incurred.
The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed one year and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term
estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers
under these arrangem ents are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue,
and the remaining balances of $242 million as of December 31, 2022 and $262 million as of December 25, 2021 are included in
prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.
For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our
interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our
forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’ s actual gross revenue or volume, as
applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim
period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that
they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising
and other marketing activities. Our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation
methodology .
73
Table of Contents
Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $5.2 billion in 2022,
$5.1 billion in 2021  and $4.6 billion in 2020, including advertising expenses of $3.5 billion in both 2022 and 2021, and $3.0
billion in 2020. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:
•media and personal service prepayments;
•promotional materials in inventory; and
•production costs of future media advertising.
Deferred advertising costs of $40 million and $53 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively , are
classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.
Distribution Costs
Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are
reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $15.0 billion in 2022, $13.7
billion in 2021 and $1 1.9 billion in 2020.
Software Costs
We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining
computer software for internal use when  both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will
be used as intended.  Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or
obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software
projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included
in property , plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the
estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $123 million in 2022,
$135 million in 2021 and $152 million in 2020. Net capitalized software and development costs were $1.1 billion and $0.8 billion
as of December 31, 2022  and December 25, 2021, respectively .
Commitments and Contingencies
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certa in taxes and environmental matters, as well as
commitments under  contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments
when a loss is probable and estimable.
Research and Development
We engage  in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation
globally . Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research
and development costs were $771 million, $752 million and $719 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively , and are reported
within selling, general and administrative expenses.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually ,
using either a qualitative or quantitati ve approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter , or more
frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment,
first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include
macroeconomic conditions (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary cost
environment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment,
74
Table of Contents
historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that
it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair
value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively . Estimated fair value is determined using
discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with
management’ s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetu ity growth assumptions and the selection of
assumptions underly ing a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant
management judgme nt is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including
those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflation ary cost environment) to estimate future levels of
sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and
goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are
based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration
in these assumptions could adversely impact our results.
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its
estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
See Note 4 for further information.

Note 3 — Restructuring and Impairment Charges
2019 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan
We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new
technology and business models to further simplify , harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and
information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our
manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth
quarter of 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within
the initiatives described above.  As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billio n, including cash
expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately  55% of severance and
other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35%
for other co sts associated with the implementation of our initiatives.
The total plan pre-tax char ges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:

Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over an intangible asset’ s estimated useful life. Amortization of intangible
assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 and using average 2022 foreign
exchange rates, is expected to be as follows:
2023 2024 2025 2026 2027
Five-year projected amortization $ 77 $ 76 $ 74 $ 67 $ 64 
Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written
down to its estimat ed fair value, whic h is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to
determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
In the first quarter of 2022, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division . As a
result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges (included in brand portfolio impairment charges) of $241 million ($193 million
after-tax or $0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily relate d to indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year
ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information.(a)

In the second quarte r of 2022, macroeco nomic factors, sanctions and other regulations as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict
indicated a material deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets
in Russia, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital. These factors required us to perform a
quantitative assessment, despite the absence of a material adverse impact on these assets’ financial performance (e.g., sales,
operating profit, cash flows). The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia was estimated using discounted
cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value
exceeds the fair value, with the decrease in the fair value primarily attributable  to a significant increase in the weighted-average
cost of capital, whic h reflects the macroeconomic uncertainty in Russia. As a result of the quantitative assessment, we recorded
pre-tax impairment charges of $1.2 billion ($958 million after-tax or $0.69 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, related
to our juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division, in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further
information.
As discussed in Note 2, we perform our annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets during our third
quarter . The annual impairment assessm ent on indefinite-lived intangible assets performed in the third quarter of 2022, based on
best available market information and our internal forecasts and operating plans at the time, resulted in no impairment.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, macroeconomic conditions including a high intere st rate and inflationary cost environment, coupled
with recent business performance, indicated a deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our
indefinite-lived intangible assets in various markets, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital and
the impact of economic uncertainty on current and future financial performance, and required us to perform a quantitative
assessment on certain assets. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was estimated using discounted cash flows
under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the
fair value, which reflects the increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future sales
and their contributions to operating profit and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions). As a result
of the quantitative assessment, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $1.6 billion ($1.3 billion after-tax or $0.94 per share)
in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to the SodaStream brand in our Europe division, in the year ended
December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information.
As of December 31, 2022, the estimate d fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at
PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However , there could be an impairment  of the carrying value of PBNA ’s reacq uired and
acquired franchise rights, as well as further impairment to the carrying value of the SodaStream brand and goodwill, if future
sales and their contributions to operating profit do not achieve our expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth
assumptions) or if macroeconomic cond itions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate
fair value.
We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021
and Decem ber 26, 2020. We did not recognize any impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended
December 25, 2021. In 2020, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $42 million, primarily related to a coconut water
brand in PBNA.
For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
In 2022, we recorded $86 million ($0.06 per share) of net tax expense related to the TCJ Act as a result of correlating adjustments
related to a partial audit settlement with the IRS for tax years 2014 through 2019. In 2021, we recorde d $190 million ($0.1 4 per
share) of net tax expense related to the TCJ Act as a result of adjustments related to the final assessment of the 2014 through
2016 IRS audit . There were no tax amounts recognized in 2020 related to the TCJ Act.
81
Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2022, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.6 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the
provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $309 million
in 2022, $309 millio n in 2021 and $78 million in 2020. We currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in
2023.
The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax
income (GIL TI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder . The FASB allows an accounting policy election
of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such
taxes as a current-p eriod expense when incurred. We elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when
incurred.
Other T ax Matters
In 2021, we received a final assessment from the IRS audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. The assessment included both
agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals
conference. As a result of the analysis of the 2014 through 2016 final assessment, we remeasured all applicable reserves for
uncertain tax positions for all years open under the statute of limitations, including any correlating adjustments impacting the
mandatory transition  tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $112 million ($0.08 per share) in
2021.
In 2022 , we came  to an agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The
agreement covers tax years 2014 throug h 2019. As a result, we reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any
correlating adjustme nts impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax benefit
of $233 million ($0.17 per share) in 2022 . Tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues.
On August 16, 2022 , the “Inflation Reduction Act” (H.R. 5376) was signed into law in the United States. We do not currently
expect the Inflation Reduction Act to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual estimated effective
tax rate or on our liquidity .
On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF),
effective January 1, 2020. The enactmen t of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During
2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $72 million ($0.05 per share) related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of
Bern.

Reserves
A number  of years may elapse before a particular matter , for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved.
The numb er of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related
open tax audits are as follows:
Jurisdiction Years Open to AuditYears Currently Under
Audit
United States 2014-2021 2014-2019
Mexico 2014-2021 2014-2017

Canada (International) 2010-2021 2010-2019
Russia 2019-2021 None
Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer
pricing arrangemen ts, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in
determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establi sh reserves when, despite our belief that our tax
return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not
succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the
progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would
usually require the use of cash. Favora ble resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of
resolution.
As of December 31, 2022, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes,  reported in other liabilities, was $1.9 billion. We
accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in
selling, general and administrative expe nses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $292 million
as of December 31, 2022, of which $4 million of tax benefit was recognized  in 2022. The gross amount of interest accrued,
reported in other liabilities, was $326 million as of December 25, 2021, of which $3 million of tax benefit was recognized in
2021.

state jurisd ictions where we are permitt ed to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These
operating losses will expire as follows: $0.2 billion in 2023, $27.6 billion between 2024 and 2041 and $4.4 billion may be carried
forward indefinitely . We
84

establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
Undistributed International Earnings
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $9 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to
reinvest $9 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings
would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange
gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount
of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.
Note 6 — Shar e-Based Compensation
Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with
the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under
the shareholder -approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives
based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination
thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been
granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-
term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance tar gets.
The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirem ents resulting from the exercise of stock options
and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs.
As of December 31, 2022, 37 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the L TIP.
The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and
administrative expenses, and excess tax benefits recognized:

Income tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation $ 62 $ 57 $ 48 
Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation $ 44 $ 38 $ 35 
As of December 31, 2022, there was $396 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two
years.
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions
The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years. Awards to
employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the
date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition,
we use historical data to estimate
85
Table of Contents
forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively . Repricing of awards would require
shareholder approval under the L TIP.
Stock Options
A stock option perm its the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee
stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense
at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date
of grant and generally have a 10-year term.
Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:
2022 2021 2020
Expected life 7 years 7 years 6 years
Risk-free interest rate 1.9 % 1.1 % 0.9 %
Expected volatility 16 % 14 % 14 %
Expected dividend yield 2.5 % 3.1 % 3.4 %
The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical
experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life.
Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical  period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend
yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and
stock price.

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units
Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end
of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end
of the service period based on PepsiCo’ s performance against specified financial performance metrics. The number of shares may
be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in
accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend
equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable.
The fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Company’ s stock on the date of grant.

Note 7 — Pension, Retir ee Medical and Savings Plans
Effective December 31, 2022, we merged two U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan
I (Plan I), mostly inactive participants, and PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A), mostly active participants, with Plan
I remaining. The accrued benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The merger was made to provide additional
flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility . Actuaria l gains and losses of the merged plan will be
amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. There is no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits
expense from this mer ger.
In 2022, we transfer red pension and retiree medical obligations of $145 million and related assets to TBG in connection with the
Juice T ransaction. See Note 13 for further information.(a) (b)

In 2021, we adopted  a change to the Canadian defined benefit plans to freeze pension accruals for salaried participants, effective
January 1, 2024, and to close the hourly plan to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2022. After the effective
date, all salaried participants receive an employer contribution to the defined contribution plan based on age and years of service
regardless of employee contribution and the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to
defined limits. We also adopted a change to the U.K. defined benefit plan to freeze pension accruals for all participants effective
March 31, 2022. After the effective date, participants have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee
contributions up to defined limits. Pre-tax pension benefits expense will decrease after the effective dates, partially offset by
contributions to defined contribution plans.
In 2021, we adopted  a change to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans to transfer certain participants from Plan A to Plan I,
effective January 1, 2022. The accrued benefits offered to the plans’ participant s were unchanged. There was no material impact
to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this transaction.
In 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants,
effective December 31, 2025. Since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the
effective date, all salaried participants receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of
service regardless of employee contribution and the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee
contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense decreased $70 million in 2021,
primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.
In 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of
certain participants from Plan A to Plan I and to a newly created plan, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H),
effective January 1, 2021. The accrued benefits offered to the plans’ participants  were unchanged. The reorganization facilitated a
more targeted investment strategy and provided additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility .
There was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense as a result of this reor ganization.
In 2020, we adopted  an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan
H. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense increased $45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service
cost expense.
Gains and losses resulting from actual experience dif fering from our assumptions, including the dif ference between the actual and
expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. These
differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common
shareholders’ equity . If this net accumul ated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or
plan oblig ations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for
the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 9 years), Plan H
(approximately 11 years) and retiree medical (approximately 9 years), and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I
(approximately 27 years). In 2023, we expect the average remaining service life for participants in Plan H to be approximately 11
years and the average remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I to be approximately 26 years.
The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior  employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is
included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining
service life for participants in Plan H, and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I, except that prior service
cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the freeze is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective
date of the freeze.

The amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the

Table of Contents
value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year .
The amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:
•Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.
•Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will
be used to settle future benefit obligations.
•Amortization of prior service cost/(cred it) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting
from plan amendments.
•Amortization of net loss/(gain) represen ts the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets
and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.
•Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related
projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan
due to lump sums or other events excee d the total of annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when
actions are irrevocab le and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Lump
sum payouts are generally higher when interest rates are lower . Curtailments are recognized when events such as plant
closures, the sale of a business, or plan changes result in a significant reduction  of future service or benefits. Curtailment
losses are recognize d when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has
occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).
•Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as
restructuring.

(a) Includes $150 million contribution in 2022, $500 million contribution in 2021 and $325 million contribution in 2020 to fund our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans.
We made a discretionary contribution of $125 million to a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan in January 2023 and expect to make
an additional contribution of $125 millio n in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, in 2023, we expect to make non-discretionary
contributions of approximately $90 million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans and contributions of approximately
$55 million for retiree medical benefits.
We also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.
Plan Assets
Our pensio n plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction
with plan obligation s, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This
strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are
available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Asset s contributed to our pension plans are no longer
controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However , we are indirectly impacted by changes in
these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan
assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return
expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to
reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future
date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards.
For 2023 and 2022 , our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.4% and 6.7%, respectively . Our target
investment allocations for U.S. plan assets for both 2023 and 2022 are as follows:
Fixed income 56 %
U.S. equity 22 %
International equity 18 %
Real estate 4 %
Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly
review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.
The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset
class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current
levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return
assumptions annuall y to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value
of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a(a)

method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-
related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the ef fect of reducing year -to-year volatility .

Savings Plan
Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. The
plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement and we make Company matching contributions for certain
employees on a portion of employee contributions based on years of service.
Certain U.S. salaried employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined  benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive
an employer contribution based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.
In 2022, 2021 and 2020, our total Company contributions were $283 million, $246 million and $225 million, respectively .

(a) Excludes debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums.
(b) These notes, issued in British pounds, were designate d as net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our
foreign subsidiaries.
The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general  corporate purposes, including the repayment of
commercial paper , except for an amount equivalent to the net proceeds from our 3.900% senior notes due 2032 that will be
allocated to fund, in whole or in part, eligible green projects in the categories of investments in recycling and sustainable plastics
and packaging, decarbonizing our operations and supply chain, water sustainab ility, and regenerative agriculture, which promote
our selected Sustainable Development Goals, as defined by the United Nations.
In 2022, we entered into a new five-yea r unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Y ear Credit Agreement), which expires on
May 27, 2027. The Five-Y ear Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.8 billion in U.S.
dollars and/or euros, including a $0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed
on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be
increased up to $4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally , we may, once a year, request renewal of the
agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Y ear Credit Agreement replaced our $3.75 billion five-year credit
agreement, dated as of May 28, 2021.
Also in 2022, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreem ent (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires
on May 26, 2023. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.8 billion in U.S.
dollars and/or euros, subject to custom ary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be
increased up to $4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day
period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later
than the anniversary of the then effectiv e termination date. The 364-Day Cred it Agreement replaced our $3.75 billion 364-day
credit agreement, dated as of May 28, 2021.
Funds borrowed under the Five-Y ear Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate
purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow , prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of
December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Y ear Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit
Agreement.(a)

Note 9 — Financial Instruments
Derivatives and Hedging
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal cours e of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of
strategies, including  productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve
the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of
derivatives. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our global purchasing programs include
fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.
Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain
derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not
qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging
instrument’ s fair value to offset corresp onding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item
impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction
affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur ,
97
Table of Contents
we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended
December 31, 2022 were not material.
Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating
activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with
the underlying hedged item.
Credit Risk
We perform assessments of our counterp arty credit risk regularly , including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of
credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty . Based on our most recent assessment of
our counterparty credit risk, we consid er this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of
financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.
Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full colla teral on derivative instruments in a net liability
position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’ s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on
credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative
instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 31, 2022 was $235
million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of
December 31, 2022.
Commodity Prices
We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increase d costs through higher pricing may be limited in
the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed throu gh the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase
orders, pricing agreements and derivativ e instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply
of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms
of no more than three years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for
agricultural products, energy and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated
expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These
gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the division s recognize the cost of the underlying commodity
in operating profit.
Our comm odity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $1.6 billion as of
December 25, 2021.
Foreign Exchange
We are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed
or sold. Additionally , we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency
purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through
sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currenci es with foreign suppliers and through the use of
derivatives, primarily forward contracts  with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign
currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. We also use net
investment hedges to partially of fset the ef fects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
Our foreig n currency derivatives had a total notional value of $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.8 billion as of
December 25, 2021. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net
98
Table of Contents
investment hedges was $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.1 billion  as of December 25, 2021. For foreign currency
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses  were offset by changes in the underlying hedged
items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings.
Inter est Rates
We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and
overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps,
cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange
risk. These instruments effectively chan ge the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. The notional amount, interest
payment and maturi ty date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and
maturity date of the related debt. Our cross-currency interest rate swaps have terms of no more than twelve years. Our Treasury
locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.
Our intere st rate derivatives had a total notional value of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.1 billion as of
December 25, 2021.
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 1% of total debt was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 2%, after the
impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, as of December 25, 2021.
Debt Securities
Held-to-Maturity
Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity .
Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. As of
December 31, 2022, we had no investments in held-to-maturity debt securities. As of December 25, 2021, we had $130 million of
investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at
amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. As of December 25, 2021,
gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material.
Available-for -Sale
Investments in available-for -sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Changes in the fair value of available-for -sale debt
securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity . Changes in the
fair value of availab le-for -sale debt securities impact earnings only when such securities are sold, or an allowance for expected
credit losses or impairment is recognized. We regularly evaluate our investment portfolio for expected credit losses and
impairment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the extent to which the fair value of a debt security is less
than its amortized cost; the financial condition of the issuer , including the credit quality , and any changes thereto; and our intent
to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.
Our assess ment of whether a debt security has a credit loss or is impaired could change in the future due to new developments or
changes in assumptions related to any particular debt security .
In 2022, we entered into an agreement with Celsius to distribute Celsius energy drinks in the United States (see Note 4 for further
information) and invested $550 million in Series A convertible preferred shares issued by Celsius, which included certain
conversion and redemption features. The preferred shares automatically convert into Celsius common shares after six years if
certain market-based conditions are met, or can be redeemed after seven years.  Shares underlying the transaction were priced at
$75 per share,
99
Table of Contents
and the preferred shares are entitled to a 5% annual dividend, payable either in cash or in-kind. Given our redemption right, we
classified our investment in the converti ble preferred stock as an available-for -sale debt security . There were no unrealized gains
and losses on our investment as of Dece mber 31, 2022. There were no impairment charges related to our investment in the year
ended December 31, 2022.

Note 12 — Leases
Lessee
We determine whether an arrangement  is a lease at inception. We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution
centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally
have rema ining lease terms of up to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years and
some of which inclu de options to terminate the lease within one year. We consider these options in determining the lease term
used to establish our right-of-use assets  and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value
guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available
at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
We have lease agreements that contai n both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease
components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).

Note 13 — Acquisitions and Divestitur es
Juice T ransaction
In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately
$3.5 billion in cash,  subject to purchase price adjustments, and a 39% noncon trolling interest in TBG, operating across North
America and Europe. The North America portion of the transaction was completed on January 24, 2022 and the Europe portion
of the transaction was completed on February 1, 2022. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBG’ s
portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled DSD. We have significant influence over our
investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method , recognizing our proportionate share of TBG’ s
earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses).
As a resul t of this transaction, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a gain in our PBNA and Europe divisions (see
detailed income statement activity below), including $520 million related to the remeasurement of our 39% ownership in TBG at
fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our
liquidation preference in TBG . In the fourth quarter of 2022, we reached an agreement on final purchase price adjustments for net
working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase
agreement.

2020 Acquisitions
On March 23, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage company in South Africa
with exports to coun tries across the globe, for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash. The total consideration transferred
was approximately $1.2 billion and was funded by two unsecured bridge loan facilities entered into by one of our international
consolidated subsidiaries, which were fully repaid in April 2020.
In connection with our acquisition of Pioneer Foods, we have made certain  commitments to the South Africa Competition
Commission, including a commitment to provide the equivalent of 8.8 billion South African rand, or approximately $0.5 billion
as of the acquisition date, in value for the benefit of our employees, agricultural development, education, developing Pioneer
Foods’ operations and enterprise development programs in South Africa. Included in this commitment is 2.3 billion South
African rand, or approximately $0.1 billion, relating to the implementation of an employee ownership plan and an agricultural,
entrepreneurship and educational development fund, which is an irrevocable condition of the acquisition. This commitment was
recorded in selling, general and adminis trative expenses primarily in the year ended December 26, 2020 and was primarily settled
in the fourth quarter  of 2021. The remaining commitment of 6.5 billion South African rand, or approximately $0.4 billion as of
the acquis ition date, relates to capital expenditures and/or business-related costs  which will be incurred and recorded over a five-
year period from the acquisition date.
On April 24, 2020, we acquired Rockstar , an energy drink maker with whom we had a distribution agreement prior to the
acquisition, for an upfront cash payment of approximately $3.85 billion and contingent consideration related to estimated future
tax benefits associated with the acquisiti on of approximately $0.88 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we exercised our option
to accelerate all remaining payments due under the contingent consideration arrangement.
On June 1, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Be & Cheery , one of the largest online convenient food companies
in China, from Haoxiangni Health Food Co., Ltd. for  cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $0.7 billion.
We accounted for the 2020 transactions as business combinations. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired
and liabili ties assumed at their estimated  fair values on the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase price allocations for each
of the 2020 acquisiti ons were finalized in the second quarter of 2021. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in the acquisitions of Pionee r Foods, Rockstar and Be & Cheery and the resulting goodwill as of the respective
acquisition dates is summarized as follows:

leverage Be & Cheery’s direct-to-consumer and supply chain capabilities and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the
goodwill is recorded in the AP AC division.
Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges
Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the
acquisition-date balance sheets (recorded in cost of sales), merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures
(recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support
socioeconomic programs in South Africa, gains associated with contingent consideration, employee-related costs, contract
termination costs, closing costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related  charges reflect transaction expenses, including
consulting, advisory and other professional fees.

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
PepsiCo, Inc.:
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Contr ol Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of
December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash
Flows, and Equity for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes
(collectively , the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Contr ol – Integrated Framew ork (2013)  issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Or ganizations of the T readway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the financial position
of the Com pany as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in confo rmity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Or ganizations of the T readway Commission.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’ s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financi al Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’ s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’ s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCA OB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Thos e standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedu res to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Table of Contents
Definition and Limitations of Internal Contr ol Over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting  principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provid e reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding preventi on or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s
assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below , providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Sales incentive accruals
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through
various programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the
need to accrue for the expected liability . These incentives are accrued for in the “Accounts payable and other current
liabilities” line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding
customer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends.
We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’ s sales incentive accrua ls as a critical audit matter . Subjective and
complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference
between when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer
and consumer participation and perform ance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical
experience and trends.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critica l audit matter . We evaluated the design and
tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the sales incentive process, including controls related
to (1) the accrual methodology , (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance
levels, and (4) moni toring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estim ated sales incentives in respect of historical
periods. To evaluat e the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales
incentive type as compared to historica l trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2)
recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis,
111
Table of Contents
based on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Comp any’s ability to accurately estimate its sales
incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements
or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual.
Carrying value of certain r eacquir ed and acquir ed franchise rights and SodaStr eam brand
As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing of its
indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and
changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. The carrying value
of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 was $32.5 billion  which represents 35% of total assets, and
includes PepsiCo Beverages North Ame rica’s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value
of $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2022.
We identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA ’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and the SodaStream
brand in Europe as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the impact of competitive
operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The impairment analysis of
these indefinite-live d intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the Company’ s forecasted revenue
and profita bility levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of the discount rates to be applied
to the projected cash flows.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critica l audit matter . We evaluated the design and
tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the indefinite-lived assets impairment process,
including controls related to the develo pment of forecasted revenue, profitability levels, and expected long-term growth
rates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows . We also evaluated the sensitivity of the
Company’ s conclusion to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods.
To assess the Company’ s ability to accurately forecast, we compared the Company’ s historical forecasted results to actual
results. We compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other
internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating
(1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing agains t economic data and information specific to
the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local
countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by compar ing them against discount rates that were
independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies.
Unrecognized tax benefits
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’ s global operating model gives rise to income
tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which  it operates. As of December 31, 2022, the
Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes
that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though
the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well
as the related intere st, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court
rulings or tax authority settlements.
We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’ s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the
application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority’ s settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment.
Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of
112
Table of Contents
the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years’ tax
returns in light of new information.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critica l audit matter . We evaluated the design and
tested the operating  effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the unrecognized tax benefits process, including
controls to (1) identi fy uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority’ s settlement history used to
estimate the unrecog nized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing
unrecognized tax benefits, such as progr ess of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority settlements. We involved tax
and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted  in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits
by (1) evaluating the Company’ s tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing
the Comp any’s interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated
external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements.

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation , under
the superv ision and with the participatio n of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-
15(e) and 15d-15(e)  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Of ficer and Chief Financial Of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b) Mana gement’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based
upon criteria established in Internal Contr ol – Integrated Framework  (2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was ef fective as of December 31, 2022.
Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm . KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
has audite d the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has
issued their report, included herein, on the ef fectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  During our fourth quarter of 2022, we continued migrating certain of
our financial processing systems to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution. These systems implementations are part of
our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts
of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these  ERP implementations, we are updating and will
continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary , to accommodate modifications to our business
processes and accounting procedures. During 2022, we continued implementing these systems, resulting in changes that
materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect,
nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over finan cial reporting. In addition, in connection with our
2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue  to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify ,
harmonize and automate processes. In connection with our 2019 multi-year
116
Table of Contents
productivity plan and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal
control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These business process

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON ST OCK
The following description of our common stock is based upon our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation,
effective as of May 1, 2019 (“Articles of Incorporation”), our By-Laws, as amended and restated, effective as of April 15, 2020
(“By-Laws”) and applicable provisions of law. We have summarized certain portions of the Articles of Incorporation and By-
Laws below. The summary is not complete. The Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws are incorporated by reference as exhibits
to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this exhibit is a part. Y ou should read the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws for
the provisions that are important to you.
General
Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 3,600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value one and two-thirds
cents (1-2/ 3 cents) per share. As of February 2, 2023, there were 1,377,251,316 shares of common stock outstanding which were
held of record by 98,573 shareholders.
Voting Rights.  Each holder of a share of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held of record on the
applicable record date on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders. Action on a matter generally requires that the votes
cast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast in opposition. A plurality vote is required in an election of the Board of Directors
where the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected.
Dividend Rights.  Hold ers of our common stock are entitl ed to receive dividends as may be declared from time to time by
PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor .
Rights Upon Liquidation.  Holders of our common stock are entitled to share pro rata, upon any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of Pepsi Co, in all remaining assets available for distribution to share holders after payment or providing for PepsiCo’ s
liabilities.
Preemptive Rights.  Holders of our common stock do not have the right to subscribe for, purchase or receive new or
additional common stock or other securities.

Stock Exchange Listing
The Nasdaq Global Select Market is the principal market for our common stock, where it is listed under the symbol
“PEP ,” and our common stock is also listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange.
Certain Pr ovisions of PepsiCo’ s Articles of Incorporation and By -Laws; Dir ector Indemnification Agr eements
Advance Notice of Proposals and Nom inations.  Our By-Laws provide that shareholders must provide timely written
notice to bring busin ess before an annual meeting of shareholders or to nominat e candidates for election as directors at an annual
meeting of shareholders. Notice for an annual meeting is generally timely if it is received at our principal office not less than
90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. However , if the date of the
annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed more than 60 days from this anniversary date, or if no annual
meeting was held in the preceding year, such notice by the shareholder must be delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to
the annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth
day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting was first made. Shareholders utilizing
“proxy access” must meet separate dead lines. The By-Laws also specify the form and content of a shareholder ’s notice. These
provisions may prevent shareholders from bringing matters before an annua l meeting of shareholders or from nominating
candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of shareholders.
Proxy Access.  Our By-Laws conta in “proxy access” provisions which give an eligible shareho lder (or a group of up to 20
shareholders aggreg ating their shares) that has owned 3% or more of the outstanding common stock continuously for at least
three years the right to nominate the greater of two nominees and 20% of the number of directors to be elected at the applicable
annual general meeting, and to have those nominees included in our proxy materials, subject to the other terms and conditions of
our By-Laws.
3
Special Meetings.  A special meeting of the shareholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board, by resolution of the
Board or by our corporate secretary upon written request of one or more share holders holding shares of record representing at
least 20% in the aggregate of our outsta nding common stock entitled to vote at such meeting. Any such special meeting called at
the reques t of our shareholders will be held at such date, time and place (if any) as may be fixed by our Board, provided that the
date of such special meeting may not be more than 90 days from the receipt of such request by the corporate secretary . The By-
Laws specify the form and content of a shareholder ’s request for a special meeting.
Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees.  Our By-L aws provi de that unless the Board determines otherwise,
we shall indemnify , to the full extent permitted by law, any person who was or is, or who is threatened to be made, a party to an
action, suit or proceeding (including appeals), whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or arbitrative, by reason of the
fact that such person, such person’ s testator or intestate, is or was one of our directors, officers or employees, or is or was serving
at our request as a director , officer or employee of another enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding. Pursuant to our By-Laws this indemnification may, at the Board’ s discretion, also include advancement of expenses
prior to the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding.
In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, pursuant to which
we have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each director against any and all liabilities
and assessments (including attorneys’ fees and other costs, expenses and obligations) arising out of or related to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or other ,
including, but not limited to, judgments,  fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (whether with or without court approval),
and any interest, assessments, excise taxes or other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any of the
foregoing, incurred by the independent director and arising out of his status as a director or
4
member of a commi ttee of our Board, or by reason of anything done or not done by the director in such capacities. After receipt
of an appropriate request by an independent director , we will also advance all expenses, costs and other obligations (including
attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to such matters. We will not be liable for payment of any liability or expense incurred by
an independent director on account of acts which, at the time taken, were known or believed by such director to be clearly in
conflict with our best interests.
Certain Anti -Takeover Effects of North Car olina Law
The North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act generally requires the affirmative vote of 95% of a public corporation’ s
voting shares to approve a “business combination” with any entity that a majority of continuing directors determines beneficially
owns, directly or indirectly , more than 20% of the voting shares of the corporation (or ever owned, directly or indirectly , more
than 20% and is still an “affiliate” of the corporation) unless the fair price provisions and the procedural provisions of the North
Carolina Shareholder Protection Act are satisfied.
“Business combination” is defined by the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act as (i) any merger, consolidation or
conversion of a corporation with or into any other entity , or (ii) any sale or lease  of all or any substantial part of the corporation’ s
assets to any other entity, or (iii) any payment, sale or lease to the corporation or any subsidiary thereof in exchange for securities
of the corporation of any assets having an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than $5,000,000 of any other entity .
The North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act contains provisions that allowed a corporation to “opt out” of the
applicability of the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act’s voting provisions within specified time periods that generally
have expired. The Act applies to PepsiCo since we did not opt out within these time periods.
This statu te could discourage a third party from making a partial tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain a
substantial position in our equity securi ties or seeking to obtain control of us. It also might limit the price that certain investors
might be willing to pay in the future for our
5
shares of common stock and may have the ef fect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us.

exchange rate for sterling, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the sterling notes so made in
U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the sterling notes or the indenture governing the sterling notes. Neither

member states of the European Monetar y Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions
by public institution s of or within the international banking community , then all payments in respect of the euro notes will be
made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us and so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in

sections of the Code; or

The notes are subjec t in all cases to any tax, fiscal or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation
applicable to the notes. Except as specifically provided under this heading “—P ayment of Additional Amounts,” we will not be

federal income taxation regardless of its source.
Redemption for T ax Reasons

the United  States (or any taxing authority in the United States), or any change in, or amendments to, an official position regarding
the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes

based upon a written opinion of independent counsel selected by us, will become obligated to pay additional amounts as

any time at our option redeem, in whole , but not in part, the outstanding notes of such series on not less than 30 nor more than 60
days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest on
those notes to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption.
Certain Covenants
Limitation of Liens
We will not, and will not permit any of our restricted subsidiaries to, incur , suffer to exist or guarantee any debt secured
by a lien on any principal property or on any shares of stock of (or other interes ts in) any of our restricted subsidiaries unless we
or that first-mention ed restricted subsidiary secures or causes such restricted subsidiary to secure the notes (and any of its or such
restricted subsidiary’ s other debt, at its option or such restricted subsidiary’ s option, as the case may be, not subordinate to the
notes), equally and ratably with (or prior to) such secured debt, for as long as such secured debt will be so secured.
These restrictions will not, however , apply to debt secured by:
28
(1)    any liens existing prior to the issuance of such notes;
(2)    any lien on property of or shares  of stock of (or other interests in) or debt of any entity existing at the time such
entity becomes a restricted subsidiary;
(3)    any liens on property , shares of stock of (or other interests in) or debt of any entity (a) existing at the time of
acquisition of such property or shares (or other interests) (including acquisition  through merger or consolidation),
(b) to secure the payment of all or any part of the purchase price of such prope rty or shares (or other interests) or
construction or improvement of such property or (c) to secure any debt incurred prior to, at the time of, or within
365 days after the later of the acquisitio n, the completion of construction or the commencement of full operation
of such property or within 365 days after the acquisition of such shares (or other interests) for the purpose of
financing all or any part of the purchase price of such shares (or other interests) or construction thereon;
(4)    any liens in favor of us or any of our restricted subsidiaries;
(5)    any liens in favor of, or required by contracts with, governmental entities; or
(6)    any extension, renewal, or refunding of liens referred to in any of the preceding clauses (1) through (5).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we or any of our restricted subsidiaries may incur, suffer to exist or guarantee any debt
secured by a lien on any principal prope rty or on any shares of stock of (or other interests in) any of our restricted subsidiaries if,
after giving ef fect thereto, the aggregate amount of such debt does not exceed 15% of our consolidated net tangible assets.
The indenture does not restrict the transfer by us of a principal property to any of our unrestricted subsidiaries or our
ability to change the designation of a subsidiary owning principal property  from a restricted subsidiary to an unrestricted
subsidiary and, if we were to do so, any
29
such unres tricted subsidiary would not be restricted from incurring secured debt nor would we be required, upon such incurrence,
to secure the notes equally and ratably with such secured debt.
Consolidation, Mer ger or Sale of Assets
We may consolidate or merge with or into, or convey or transfer all or substantially all of our assets to, any entity
(including, without limitation, a limited partnership or a limited liability company); provided  that:
•    we will be the surviving corporatio n or, if not, that the successor will be a corporation that is organized and validly
existing under the laws of any state of the United States of America or the District of Columbia and will expressly
assume by a supplemental indenture our obligations under the indenture and the notes;
•    imme diately after giving effect to such transaction, no event of default, and no default or other event which, after
notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an event of default, will have happened and be continuing; and
•    we will have delivered to the truste e an opinion of counsel, stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance or
transfer complies with the indenture.
In the event of any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, any such successor will succeed to and be
substituted for us as obligor on the notes with the same effect as if it had been named in the indenture as obligor , and we will be
released from all obligations under the indenture and under the notes.
Definitions
“Consolidated net tangible assets” means the total amount of our assets and our restricted subsidiaries’ assets minus:
•    all applicable depreciation, amortization and other valuation reserves;
30
•    all current liabilities of ours and our restricted subsidiaries (excluding any intercompany liabilities); and
•    all goodwill, trade names, trademarks, patents, unamortized debt discount and expenses and other like intangibles, all
as set forth on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ latest consolidated balance sheets prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.
“Debt” means any indebtedness for borrowed money .
“Principal property” means any single manufacturing or processing plant, office building or warehouse owned or leased
by us or any of our restricted subsidiari es other than a plant, warehouse, office building or portion thereof which, in the opinion
of our Board of Directors, is not of material importance to the business conducted by us and our restricted subsidiaries taken as
an entirety .
“Restricted subsidiary” means, at any time, any subsidiary which at the time is not an unrestricted subsidiary of ours.
“Subsidiary” means any entity , at least a majority of the outstanding voting stock of which shall at the time be owned,
directly or indirectly , by us or by one or more of our subsidiaries, or both.
“Unrestricted subsid iary” means any subsidiary of ours (not at the time designated as our restricted subsidiary) (1) the
major part of whose business consists of finance, banking, credit, leasing, insurance, financial services or other similar
operations, or any combination thereof, (2) substantially all the assets of which consist of the capital stock of one or more
subsidiaries engaged  in the operations referred to in the preceding clause (1), or (3) designated as an unrestricted subsidiary by
our Board of Directors.
Events of Default
An “Event of Default” under the notes of a given series means:
31
(1)    default in paying interest on the notes when it becomes due and the default continues for a period of 30 days or
more;
(2)    default in paying principal, or premium, if any , on the notes when due;
(3)    default is made in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund or analogous obligation when the same becomes due,
and such default continues for 30 days or more;
(4)    default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of PepsiCo in the indenture (other than defaults
specified in clause (1), (2) or (3) above) and the default or breach continues for a period of 90 days or more after
we receive written notice from the trustee or we and the trustee receive notice from the holders of at least 51% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of the series;
(5)    certain events of bankruptcy , insolvency , reorganization, administration or similar proceedings with respect to
PepsiCo have occurred; or
(6)    any other Events of Default set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5) with respect to PepsiCo) under the indenture
occurs with respect to the notes of any series and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least 51% in principal amount
of the outstanding notes of that series may by written notice require us to repay immediately the entire principal amount of the
outstanding notes of that series (or such lesser amount as may be provided in the terms of the notes), together with all accrued
and unpaid interest and premium, if any .
If an Event of Defau lt under the indentu re specified in clause (5) with respect to PepsiCo occurs and is continuing, then
the entire principal amount of the outstanding notes (or such lesser amount as may be provided in the terms of the notes) will
automatically become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder .
32
After a declaration of acceleration, the holders of not less than 51% in aggregate  principal amount of outstanding notes of
any series may rescind this accelerated payment requirement if all existing Events of Default, except for nonpayment of the
principal and interes t on the notes of that series that has become due solely as a result of the accelerated payment requirement,
have been  cured or waived and if the rescission of acceleration would not confl ict with any judgment or decree. The holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of any series also have the right to waive past defaults, except a default in
paying principal, premium or interest on any outstanding note, or in respect of a covenant or a provision that cannot be modified
or amended without the consent of all holders of the notes of that series.
Holders of at least 51% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of a serie s may seek to institute a proceeding only
after they have notif ied the trustee of a continuing Event of Default in writing and made a written request, and offered reasonable
indemnity , to the trustee to institute a proceeding and the trustee has failed to do so within 60 days after it received this notice. In
addition, within this 60 day period the trustee must not have received directions inconsistent with this written request by holders
of a majo rity in principal amount of the outstanding notes of that series. These limitations do not apply , however , to a suit
instituted by a holder of a note for the enforcement of the payment of principal, interest or any premium on or after the due dates
for such payment.
During the existence of an Event of Default, the trustee is required to exercise the rights and powers vested in it under the
indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent man would under the circumstances in the conduct
of that person’ s own affairs. If an Even t of Default has occurred and is conti nuing, the trustee is not under any obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers at the request or direction of any of the holders unless the holders have offered to the trustee
reasonable security or indemnity . Subject to certain provisions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
notes of any series have the right to direct the time, method and place of condu cting any proceeding for any remedy available to
the trustee, or exercising any trust, or power conferred on the trustee.
33
The trustee will, within 90 days after any default occurs, give notice of the default to the holders of the notes of that
series, unless the default was already cured or waived. Unless there is a default in paying principal, interest or any premium when
due, the trustee can withhold giving notice to the holders if it determines in good faith that the withholding of notice is in the
interest of the holders.
Modification and W aiver
The indenture may be amended or modified without the consent of any holder of notes in order to:
•    evidence a succession to the trustee;
•    cure ambiguities, defects or inconsistencies;
•    provide for the assumption of our obligations in the case of a merger or consolidation or transfer of all or substantially
all of our assets;
•    make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of the notes of a series;
•    add guarantors with respect to the notes of any series;
•    secure the notes of a series;
•    establish the form or forms of notes of any series;
•    maintain the qualification of the indenture under the T rust Indenture Act; or
•    make any change that does not adversely af fect in any material respect the interests of any holder .
Other amendments and modifications of the indenture or the notes issued may be made with the consent of the holders of
not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of each series affected by the amendment or
modification. However , no
34
modification or amendment may , without the consent of the holder of each outstanding note af fected:
•    reduce the principal amount, interest or premium payable, or extend the fixed maturity , of the notes;
•    alter or waive the redemption provisions of the notes;
•    change the currency in which principal, any premium or interest is paid;
•    reduce  the percentage in principal amount outstanding of notes of any series which must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver or consent to take any action;
•    impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on the notes;
•    waive a payment default with respect to the notes or any guarantor;
•    reduce the interest rate or extend the time for payment of interest on the notes;
•    adversely af fect the ranking of the notes of any series; or
•    release  any guarantor from any of its obligations under its guarantee or the indenture, except in compliance with the
terms of the indenture.
Satisfaction, Discharge and Covenant Defeasance
We may terminate our obligations under the indenture, when:
•    either:
•    all the notes of any series issued that have been authenticated and delivered  have been delivered to the trustee
for cancellation; or
•    all the notes of any series issued that have not been delivered to the trustee  for cancellation have become due
and payable, will become due and payable within one year, or are to be called for redemption within one year
and we
35
have made arrangements satisfactory to the trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by such trustee in our
name and at our expense, and in each case, we have irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the
trustee sufficient funds to pay and dischar ge the entire indebtedness on the series of notes to pay principal,
interest and any premium; and
•    we have paid or caused to be paid all other sums then due and payable under the indenture; and
•    we have delivered to the trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent under the indenture relating to the satisfaction and dischar ge of the indenture have been complied with.
We may elect to have our obligations under the indenture dischar ged with respect to the outstanding notes of any series
(“legal defeasance”). Legal defeasance means that we will be deemed to have paid and dischar ged the entire indebtedness
represented by the outstanding notes of such series under the indenture, except for:
•    the rights of holders of the notes to receive principal, interest and any premium when due;
•    our obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary notes, registration of transfer of the notes,
mutilated, destroyed , lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment for security
payments held in trust;
•    the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee; and
•    the defeasance provisions of the indenture.
In addition, we may elect to have our obligations released with respect to certa in covenants in the indenture (“covenant
defeasance”). Any omission to comply with these obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to
the notes of any series. In the event covenant defeasance occurs, certain events, not including non-payment,
36
bankruptcy and insolvency events, described under “Events of Default” above  will no longer constitute an event of default for
that series.
In order to exercise either legal defeasance or covenant defeasance with respect to outstanding notes of any series:
•    we must irrevoca bly have deposited or caused to be deposited with the truste e as trust funds for the purpose of making
the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to the benefit of the holders of the
notes of a series:
•    money in an amount;
•    U.S. government obligations (or equivalent government obligations in the case of notes denominated in other
than U.S. dollars or a specified currency) that will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any
payment, money in an amount; or
•    a combination of money and U.S. government obligations (or equivalent government obligations, as
applicable),
in each case sufficient, in the written  opinion (with respect to U.S. or equivalent government obligations or a
combination of money and U.S. or equivalent government obligations, as applicable) of a nationally recognized firm
of independent registered public accoun tants, to pay and dischar ge, and which shall be applied by the trustee to pay
and dischar ge, all of the principal (including mandatory sinking fund payments ), interest and any premium at the due
date or maturity;
•    in the case of legal defeasance, we must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that, under then
applicable federal income tax law, the holders of the notes of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, defeasance and dischar ge to be ef fected and will
37
be subject to the same federal income tax as would be the case if the deposit, defeasance and dischar ge did not occur;
•    in the case of covenant defeasance, we must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the
holders of the notes of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of the deposit  and covenant defeasance to be effected and will be subject to the same federal income tax as
would be the case if the deposit and covenant defeasance did not occur;
•    no event of default or default with respect to the outstanding notes of that series has occurred and is continuing at the
time of such depos it after giving effect to the deposit or, in the case of legal defeasance, no default relating to
bankruptcy or insolvency has occurred and is continuing at any time on or before the 91st day after the date of such
deposit, it being understood that this condition is not deemed satisfied until after the 91st day;
•    the legal defeasa nce or covenant defeasance will not cause the trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning
of the T rust Indenture Act, assuming all notes of a series were in default within the meaning of such Act;
•    the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under ,
any other agreement or instrument to which we are a party;
•    the legal defea sance or covenant defeasance will not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an
investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, unless the trust is
registered under such Act or exempt from registration; and
•    we must have delivered to the trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel stating that all conditions
precedent with respect to the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance have been complied with.

Book-Entry , Delivery and Settlement
We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream and Euroclear and their book-entry systems and
procedures from sources that we believe  to be reliable. We take no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In
addition, the description of the clearin g systems in this section reflects our understanding of the rules and procedures of
Clearstream and Euroclear as they are currently in effect. Those clearing system s could change their rules and procedures at any
time.
The notes of each series were initially represented by one or more fully registered global notes. Each such global note was
deposited with, or on behalf of, a comm on depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for
the accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear . Except as set forth below , the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in
part, only to Eurocl ear or Clearstream or their respective nominees. You may hold your interests in the global notes in Europe
through Clearstream or Euroclear , either as a participant in such systems or indirectly through organizations which are
participants in such systems. Clearstrea m and Euroclear will hold interests in the global notes on behalf of their respective
participating organiz ations or customers through customers’ securities accoun ts in Clearstream’ s or Euroclear ’s names on the
books of their respe ctive depositaries. Book-entry interests in the notes and all transfers relating to the notes will be reflected in
the book-entry records of Clearstream and Euroclear . The address of Clearstream is 42 A venue JF Kennedy , L-1855 Luxembour g,
Luxembour g and the address of Euroclear is 1 Boulevard Roi Albert II, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium.
The distribution of the notes was cleared through Clearstream and Euroclear . Any secondary market trading of book-entry
interests in the notes  will take place through Clearstream and Euroclear particip ants and will settle in same-day funds. Owners of
book-entry interests in the notes will receive payments relating to their notes in sterling with respect to the sterling notes and euro
with respect to the euro notes, except as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.
39
Clearstream and Euroclear have estab lished electronic securities and payment transfer , processing, depositary and
custodial links among themselves and others, either directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links allow the notes to
be issued,  held and transferred among the clearing systems without the physical transfer of certificates. Special procedures to
facilitate clearance and settlement have been established among these clearing  systems to trade securities across borders in the
secondary market.
The policies of Clearstream and Euroclear govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to the
investor ’s interest in the notes held by them. We have no responsibility for any aspect of the records kept by Clearstream or
Euroclear or any of their direct or indirect participants. W e also do not supervise these systems in any way .
Clearstream and Euroclear and their participants perform these clearance and settlement functions under agreements they
have made with one another or with their customers. You should be aware that they are not obligated to perform or continue to
perform these procedures and may modify them or discontinue them at any time.
Except as provided otherwise, owners of beneficial interests in the notes will not be entitled to have the notes registered in
their name s, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the notes in definitive form and will not be considered
the owners or holde rs of the notes under the indenture, including for purposes  of receiving any reports delivered by us or the
trustee pursuant to the indenture. Accordingly , each person owning a beneficial interest in a note must rely on the procedures of
the depositary and, if such person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its
interest, in order to exercise any rights of a holder of notes.
Certificated Notes . Subject to certain  conditions, the notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for
certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor in minimum denominations of £100,000 principal amount and integral multiples
of £1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the sterling notes and €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof with respect to the euro notes if:
40
(1)    the common depositary provides notification that it is unwilling, unab le or no longer qualified to continue as
depositary for the global notes and a successor is not appointed within 90 days;
(2)    we in our discretion at any time determine not to have all the notes of any series represented by the global note; or
(3)    default entitling the holders of the applicable notes of any series to accelerate the maturity thereof has occurred and
is continuing.
Any note of any series that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes of such series issuable in
authorized denominations and registered  in such names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a global
note is not exchang eable, except for a global note of the same aggregate denomination to be registered in the name of the
common depositary (or its nominee).
Same-day Payment . Payments (including principal, interes t and any additional amounts) and transfers with respect to
notes of any series in certificated form may be executed at the office or agency maintained for such purpose within the City of
London (initially the office of the paying agent maintained for such purpose) or, at our option, by check mailed to the holders
thereof at the respective addresses set forth in the register of holders of the applicable notes of such series, provided that all
payments (including principal, interest and any additional amounts) on notes in certificated form, for which the holders thereof
have given  wire transfer instructions, will be required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
specified by the holders thereof. No service charge will be made for any registr ation of transfer , but payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or governmental char ge payable in connection with that registration may be required.

ARTICLE I - HIST ORY AND GENERAL INFORMA TION
    The Plan came into operation on and took ef fect from September 1, 1980, and was comprised of the “PepsiCo International
Retirement Plan T rust Indenture” and the “Plan Rules”, and was later amended and restated in its entirety , effective September 2,
1982.
The Plan was further amended and restated in its entirety , effective October 1, 2003, whereupon the Plan Rules became
the “Plan A Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation’ s contributions to the trust established by the PepsiCo
International Retirement Plan T rust Indenture) and the “Plan B Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation as they
arise) took ef fect.
The Plan was further amended ef fective January 1, 2005, so that no person subject to taxation in the United States of
America may in any way have their right to a benefit from the Plan come into existence, increase or in any way be enhanced, but
instead will be determined as if they had left the Corporation and any Associated Company permanently before becoming subject
to U.S. taxation.
Effective January 1, 2010, the Plan A Rules and Plan B Rules were amended and restated in their entirety to form a single
governing legal document, as set forth herein. The terms of the Plan set forth in this amended and restated governing legal
document are known as the “DB Program” (also known as “PIRP-DB”). This amended and restated governing legal document
shall apply to Members who are in Membership from and after January 1, 2010, as well as any others who claim rights from and
after January 1, 2010 that are derived from current or former Membership, including former Members and the Dependants and
Eligible Spouses of Members and former Members. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the amendment and
restatement of this Plan, the supersession of the prior documents by this Plan, and the prior existence of separate Plan A and Plan
B Rules shall not at any time result in any duplication of benefits (nor shall duplication of benefits result from any other factor or
circumstance related to this Plan or any prior version of this Plan).
    Ef fective January 1, 201 1, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit
selected international employees for whom it has been determined to be appropriate (i.e., employees on assignments outside of
their home countries for whom it is judged to be impracticable to have them participate in their home country retirement plans
and employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages). The terms of the
DC Program are set forth in a separate governing legal document. Together , the DC Program and the DB Program set forth the
terms of a single Plan.
    The DB Program was previously amended and restated, ef fective January 1, 2016. The DB Program was again amended
and restated, ef fective January 1, 2019. The DB Program’ s most recent prior restatement was ef fective January 1, 2021 and
provided for freezing the DB Program ef fective as of the end of the day on December 31, 2025. As a result, ef fective on and after
January 1, 2026, all accruals under the DB Program, as well as all Pensionable Service, Salary and other compensation that are
recognized under the Plan, are treated as ending no later than at the end of the day on December 31, 2025, and where the DB
Program requires that Salary or other compensation be averaged over a period of service, service after December 31, 2025 is not
taken into account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in accordance with the DB Program’ s usual rules that would apply in the
absence of the DB Program freeze, a Member shall continue to earn Service (for purposes of determining whether the Member
has a vested right to a Pension) and entitlement Service (for purposes of applying more favorable early retirement factors under
the DB Program) and shall be permitted to meet any related age threshold relevant to qualify for
1
such early retirement factors while still an Employee, even after December 31, 2025. In addition, the portion of the formula that
requires projecting and prorating a Member ’s benefit, the denominator of the applicable fraction is projected to include service
after December 31, 2025 as if the DB Program were not going to freeze while the numerator of the fraction is calculated taking
into account the December 31, 2025 freeze, and then the resulting fraction is frozen as of December 31, 2025; a Member shall
continue to earn Service and shall be permitted to meet any related age threshold while still an Employee that would result in the
inapplicability of the projecting and prorating formula even after December 31, 2025.
The current restatement of the Plan is ef fective as of January 1, 2023 (the “Restatement Date”). Effective as of the
Restatement Date, the Plan’ s definition of Eligible Employee is revised to narrow the group that may initially qualify or continue
to qualify as Eligible Employees.
At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the United States Internal Revenue Code and Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that
executive’ s individual employer . With respect to his employer , the executive has the rights of an unsecured general creditor . The
Plan is also intended to be exempt from ERISA as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of
persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States.

If a Member has Salary in accordance with the prior sentence and then ceases to be employed by an Employer (but the
Member remains employed by a member of the PepsiCo Or ganization), compensation while employed by the member of
the PepsiCo Or ganization that otherwise would qualify as Salary hereunder shall be considered Salary for purposes of the
DB Program. In the event a Member ’s Salary is either (i) paid in currency other than United States dollars or (ii) paid in
United States dollars but not tied to the United States salary ranges established by the Corporation, as updated from time
to time, such currency shall be converted to United States dollars according to procedures established by the Global

the V ice President) only the period during which such Third Country National (or such other employee) was continuously
in employment (including all permissible periods of authorized leave of absence) with any Approved Employer . A
permissible period of authorized leave of absence is a period of absence of not more than 12 months, unless a longer

considered to have broken the continuity of a Member's Service. Other breaks in service (including a break in service of at
least 12 months and a break in service before an individual has become a Member) shall break the continuity of an
individual’ s Service, and employment before the break in service will only be counted as Service if it would otherwise
qualify under this subsection and the V ice President approves its being counted (which approval may provide for such
pre-break employment being counted as vesting Service, entitlement Service, or both). Vesting Service means Service that
is taken into account solely in determining vesting, and entitlement Service means Service that is taken into account
solely in determining entitlement for Early Retirement, Normal Retirement and Late Retirement.
For an individual who transfers from employment with an Employer as an ineligible Employee to the status of an
Eligible Employee of an Employer , his pre-transfer period of employment with an Employer may be counted as Service
only with the approval of the V ice President (which approval may provide for such pre-transfer employment being
counted as vesting Service, entitlement Service, or both).
Except as otherwise provided by the V ice President, Service shall not include an individual’ s periods of
employment with any company or undertaking prior to it becoming an Employer or a member of the PepsiCo
Organization.
No determination of an individual’ s Service shall result in any duplication, and all of the DB Program’ s provisions
shall at all times be interpreted consistently with the terms of this subsection.

constitutes an Approved T ransfer) that will cause the Member to become a U.S. Person.
(aa) "Third Country National " means any individual who is not: (1) a U.S. Person, (2) employed in his home
country , (3) employed in his hire country , except as permitted by the V ice President, nor (4) accruing benefits under a
retirement plan sponsored by his Employer in his home country while abroad. An individual’ s home or hire country as of
any time shall be the country that is designated at that time as the individual’ s home or hire country , respectively , on the
records of the applicable entity (which shall be the Global Mobility T eam, its successor (if any) or such other group within
the PepsiCo Or ganization that is designated for this purpose by the V ice President), or is so designated in accordance with
such rules as the applicable entity shall choose to apply from time to time. The records described in the preceding
sentence are intended to be maintained outside the United States of America.
7
(bb) " U.S. Person " means: (1) a citizen of the United States of America; (2) a person lawfully admitted for
permanent residence in the United States of America at any time during the calendar year , or who has applied for such

Code section 7701(b)(4). In addition, a person shall be considered a U.S. Person for purposes of Section 9.14 in any year
for which the person is required by the United States Internal Revenue Code to file an individual income tax return, unless
the V ice President determines that it is clear that the person has no U.S. source earned income from a member of the
PepsiCo Or ganization for such year .
(cc) "Vice President " means the V ice President, Global Benefits & W ellness of PepsiCo, Inc. but if such position is
vacant or eliminated it shall be the person who is acting to fulfill the majority of the duties of the position (or plurality of
the duties, if no one is fulfilling a majority), as such duties existed immediately prior to the vacancy or the position
elimination.

(b) Determining Periods of Y ears:  For the purposes of the DB Program, any period of 365 consecutive days (or of
366 consecutive days, if the period includes 29  February) shall be deemed to constitute a year , but not so that in the
calculation of a number of years any day is counted more than once. Where the amount of a benefit depends upon the
calculation of a number of years or months without expressly requiring that these should be complete years or months, a
proportionate amount ( i.e., a number of days) may be given for any part of a year or month which would not otherwise be
included in the calculation. Where the this document makes reference to months or parts of a year , or to any other period
of time except a day , week or year the V ice President may authorize the period to be counted in days or complete calendar
months with each calendar month counted as 1/12th of a year .
(c) Compounds of the W ord “Here”:  The words “hereof” and “hereunder” and other similar compounds of the
word “here” shall mean and refer to the entire DB Program, not to any particular provision or section.     
(d) Examples:  Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item
or items, or there is a passage having a similar ef fect, such passages of the document shall be construed as if the phrase
“without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids
limitation on its breadth of application).
(e) Subdivisions of This Document:  This document is divided and subdivided using the following progression:
articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs and clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals.
Sectionsth
8
are designated by Arabic numerals containing a decimal point. Subsections are designated by lower -case letters in
parentheses. Paragraphs are designated by Arabic numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower -case
roman numerals in parentheses. Clauses are designated by upper -case letters in parentheses. Any reference in a section to
a subsection (with no accompanying section reference) shall be read as a reference to the subsection with the specified
designation contained in that same section. A similar rule shall apply with respect to paragraph references within a
subsection and subparagraph references within a paragraph.

Member may elect, by filing a written election with the V ice President to have his Deferred V ested Pension commence as
of the first day of any month after the date he attains age 55 (or the date of his termination of employment with both his
Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization, if later). In the case of a Member electing to receive his Deferred V ested Pension
prior to attaining his Normal Retirement Date, the amount of his Pension shall be reduced in accordance with the
reduction factors applicable to early commencement of a “V ested Pension” under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan, not the
percentage factors which apply to an Early and Special Early Retirement Pension as described in Sections 4.02 and 4.03.
(d) If Member becomes entitled to a Deferred V ested Pension under subsection (a) above and once again becomes
an Eligible Employee, he shall be re-admitted to Active Membership in accordance with the provisions of Article III. His
Service and Pensionable Service from his earlier period as an Active Member shall be aggregated with his subsequent
period of Service and Pensionable Service for purposes of calculating his Pension upon his later retirement or other
termination of employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization, but only if his Pension with respect to
his earlier period of Pensionable Service was not previously cashed out under Section 5.05.
4.05    Late Retir ement Pension.
A Member who continues employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization or any Employer after his Normal Retirement Age
shall be entitled to a Late Retirement Pension. The Member ’s Annuity Starting Date shall be the first day of the month coincident
with or immediately following the day the Member terminates employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo
Organization. The Member shall be credited with his Salary and Pensionable Service after his Normal Retirement Date, unless
otherwise prospectively determined by the V ice President.
4.06    Vesting.
Subject to Section 9.14 and to T able A (I)(c), a Member shall be fully vested in, and have a nonforfeitable right to, his
Pension upon completing 5 years of Service, or if earlier , upon the death or disability of the Member while employed by the
Employer or PepsiCo Or ganization. The determination of whether a Member has become disabled for this purpose shall be made
by the V ice President in accordance with such standards that the V ice President deems to be appropriate as of the time in
question.

4.07    Special V esting for Appr oved T ransfers and Status Changes.
(a) Automatic Special V esting for Approved T ransfers. Notwithstanding Section 4.06 above, in the case of an
Active Member who will have an Approved T ransfer during a Plan Y ear, the Active Member shall automatically have
special vesting apply as of the last business day before the earlier of – (a) the Active Member ’s Approved T ransfer , or (b)
the day the Active Member would become a U.S. Person in connection with the Approved T ransfer .
(b) Special V esting for Status Changes . Also notwithstanding Section 4.06 above, in the case of an Active Member
who will have a Status Change, the Active Member may request that the V ice President apply special vesting to him as of
the last business day before the Active Member ’s Status Change. In order for special vesting related to a Status Change to
be valid and ef fective under the DB Program, the Active Member ’s request and the V ice President’ s approval of the
request must both be completely final and in place prior to the date that the special vesting applies.
Subject to the next sentence, the ef fect of special vesting applying to a Member in accordance with either subsection (a) or (b)
above is that the Member will become vested, to the same extent as could apply under Section 4.06 if the Member vested under
that Section, as of the date that the special vesting applies. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 4.07, rights
under this Section 4.07 are subject to the overriding requirement that benefits and other rights under the Plan must remain
entirely exempt from Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and this Section 4.07 shall not apply to the
extent inconsistent with this requirement.
4.08    Accruals After Benefit Commencement.
This section applies to a Member who earns Service and Pensionable Service for a period that is after his Annuity Starting
Date under the preceding Sections of this Article IV (other than an Annuity Starting Date related to a cashout distribution under
Section 5.05). Any prior benefits that have been suspended, and any additional benefits accrued by Member after his prior benefit
commencement, shall be paid at his subsequent Annuity Starting Date. The suspension or continuation of a Member ’s prior
benefits, any adjustments to the Member ’s benefits that are payable upon his subsequent Annuity Starting Date, and the election
of a time and form of payment for benefits payable at the subsequent Annuity Starting Date, shall be subject to rules established
by the V ice President for this purpose. Such rules shall be based upon the PepsiCo Salaried Plan’ s rules for benefits accrued after
the benefit commencement date of a participant in that plan, unless the V ice President determines that a modification of those
rules is appropriate.

payment, and the remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits described in Sections 5.02 and 5.03. The
benefit shall be divided between the two forms of payment based on the whole number percentages designated by the
Member on a form provided for this purpose. To be ef fective, the two percentages designated by the Member must add to

a lump sum.
(2) The amount of the benefit paid in the form of a monthly benefit is determined by multiplying: (A) the
amount of the monthly benefit elected by the Member , determined in accordance with Sections 5.03(a) or (b), by
(B) the percentage that the Member has designated for receipt in the form of a monthly benefit.
(e) Death Prior to Pension Becoming Payable : If a Member who is entitled to an immediate Pension under Article
IV elects an optional form of payment under this Section 5.03, if such election meets all requirements to be ef fective
(other than the Member ’s survival, but including the time for making the election and any necessary
16
Eligible Spouse’ s consent), and thereafter the Member dies after leaving employment but before such Pension becomes
payable, then on the first day of the month next following his death such optional form of payment shall be deemed to be
in effect. Such deemed ef fectiveness may only apply once and only to the initial election made by a Member (except as
permitted by a decision of the V ice President that is made prior to the Member ’s submission of a subsequent purported
election). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of the option under Section 5.03(b), if the Member ’s specified
Dependant has died or shall die before the date on which the first installment of the Member ’s Pension was prospectively
payable in accordance with the optional form of payment elected by the Member , the Member ’s election of such optional
form shall not be given ef fect.

Dependant under such survivor option is more than 10 years younger than the Member .
(1) Not More than 20 Y ears Y ounger : In the event the Dependant is more than 10 years younger than the
Member , but not more than 20 years younger , the percentage reduction that otherwise would apply shall be
increased by 5 percentage points.
(2) More than 20 Y ears Y ounger : In the event the Dependant is more than 20 years younger than the
Member , the 5 percentage point increase in the reduction provided in (1) above shall be further increased by an
additional 0.2 percent for each full year over 20.
5.04    Applicability of Certain Options.
    Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article V , the availability of certain distribution options shall be restricted in
accordance with the terms of this Section 5.04.
    (a) Pre-1990 Distributions : The form of payment described in Section 5.03(d) above shall not be available unless the

(b) Deferred V ested Pensions : Deferred V ested Pensions under Section 4.04 shall be eligible for payment only
under the Single Life Annuity , the 50 Percent Survivor Option or the 75 Percent Survivor Option, except as provided in
the next sentence. Effective as of January 1, 2015, Deferred V ested Pensions under Section 4.04 shall also be eligible for
the Lump Sum Payment option, but only to the limited extent that such option is available on an on-going basis with
respect to deferred vested pensions under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan (except that unlike participants in the PepsiCo
Salaried Plan, participants in this Plan with a benefit under the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan shall not be excluded
from the Lump Sum Payment option).
(c) Simplified Actuarial Factors : In the case of a Member who became entitled to a Pension prior to January 1,
1990, the actuarial equivalencies described in the preceding provisions of this Article V shall be adjusted as provided by
the V ice President from time to time to reflect the value of any subsidized survivor benefit to which the Member is
17
entitled under the last sentence of Section 5.02(b) (regarding the availability on favorable terms of the survivor benefit
described in Section 5.02(b)).
5.05    Cashout of Certain Benefits.
        (a) Cashout of Small Benefits . Where the total Pension payable to any person under the DB Program is, in the opinion of the
Vice President, of an amount that is relatively trivial (when considered by itself or in relation to the potential
administrative burden of continuing to keep track of such Pension under the DB Program), he may commute the whole of
such Pension to a lump sum payable following (i) the relevant Member ’s termination of employment from both his
Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization, or (ii) a Member ’s transfer within the PepsiCo Or ganization that results in the
Member ceasing to actively accrue all benefits under the DB Program, on a date determined in the discretion of the V ice
President, without the consent of the Member .
(b) Discretionary Cashout After Benefit Commencement . Effective January 1, 2019, the V ice President shall have
the discretion to make a lump-sum payment to any Member whose benefit payments have commenced (in a form other
than a lump-sum), if the present value of the Member ’s remaining stream of payments is less than on equal to $75,000 on
the payment date. The amount of the lump sum payment shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Member ’s remaining
stream of payments, determined utilizing the lump sum equivalent factors specified in Section 5.03(c) calculated as of the
a payment date determined in the discretion of the V ice President.
5.06    Designation of Dependant.
A Member who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor option shall
designate a Dependant who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death. A Member shall have the right to change or
revoke his Dependant designation at any time prior to the ef fective date of his election. If the Member is married at the time he
designates a Dependant, any designation under this section of a Dependant who is not the Member ’s Eligible Spouse shall require
the written consent of the Member ’s Eligible Spouse. A revocation of a Dependant does not require consent by the Member ’s
Eligible Spouse. The designation of any Dependant, and any change or revocation thereof, and any written consent of a
Member ’s Eligible Spouse required by this Section shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the V ice President, shall be
made in writing on forms provided by the V ice President, and shall not be ef fective unless and until filed with the V ice President.
In the case of the survivor option described in Section 5.03(b)(4), the following shall apply: (i) the Member shall be entitled to
name both a primary Dependant and a contingent Dependant, and (ii) if no Dependant is properly designated, then a Member ’s
election of such option will not be given ef fect.

Eligible Domestic Partner and is not entitled at the time of death to the protections provided by Section 5.03(e), there shall be
payable a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension (as applicable), which shall be
calculated based on the Member ’s Salary and Pensionable Service as of the earlier of the Member ’s death or termination of
employment. The benefit shall be calculated as if the Member lived until the earliest date the Member ’s vested benefit could have
started, after having elected to start his benefit at that time in the form of a 50 Percent Survivor Annuity , and died that same day .
    Coverage for this Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension shall be paid for with a
reduction to the monthly benefit otherwise payable to the Member . The reduction char ged to the Member ’s benefit shall be

ARTICLE VII - ADMINISTRA TION
7.01    Authority to Administer Plan.
(a) Administration by the V ice President:  The Plan shall be administered by the V ice President, who shall have the
authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as he deems appropriate. All actions by the V ice President
hereunder may be taken in his sole discretion, and all interpretations, determinations and regulations made or issued by
the V ice President shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned.
(b) Authority to Delegate:  The V ice President may delegate any of his responsibilities under the Plan to other
persons or entities, or designate or employ other persons to carry out any of his duties, responsibilities or other functions
under the Plan. Any reference in the Plan to an action by the V ice President shall, to the extent applicable, refer to such
action by the V ice President’ s delegate or other designated person.
7.02    Facility of Payment.
Whenever , in the opinion of the V ice President, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit or installment
thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the
Vice President may direct that payments from the Plan be made to such person’ s legal representative for his benefit, or that the
payment be applied for the benefit of such person in such manner as the V ice President considers advisable. Any payment of a
benefit or installment thereof in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete dischar ge of any liability for
the making of such payment under the provisions of the Plan.
7.03    Claims Pr ocedur e.
    The V ice President shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions
of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits, and his decisions on such matters are final and conclusive.
As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the V ice President decides in his discretion that the person claiming such
benefits is entitled to them. This discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case where the extent of this
discretion is in question, the V ice President is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary
authority shall be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the abuse of
discretion standard). All decisions and determinations made by the V ice President shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all
parties. The V ice President may consider the intent of the Corporation with respect to a Plan provision in making any
determination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the provisions set forth in any document that ar guably do not
contemplate considering such intent.
If, pursuant to this discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit or any other right related to the Plan (a “claim”),
by or on behalf of a Member , putative Member , Dependant or putative Dependant (a “claimant”), is wholly or partially denied,
the V ice President, or a party designated by the V ice President, will provide such claimant the claims procedure described in this
section. The V ice President has the discretionary authority to modify the claims procedure described in this Section in any
manner so long as the claims review process, as modified, includes the basic steps described in this Section. In the event of a
claim by a claimant, the V ice
21
President or the designated party shall provide the claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the
Vice President, a comprehensible written notice setting forth:
(1) The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
 
(2) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
 
(3) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the claim
and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
 
(4) A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process).
If the V ice President determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim he may
extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the V ice President will notify the claimant before the end of the
initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President
expects to make the final decision. Upon review , the V ice President shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim,
including the opportunity to submit to the V ice President comments, document, records and other information relevant to the
claim and the V ice President’ s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of
whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after
receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this
occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special
circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President expects to make the final decision. The final
decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the
decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to
receive, upon request and free of char ge, copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his or her claim for
benefits.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis
of the record before the V ice President at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on
the claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this section and in accordance with Section 7.07.
 
7.04    Limitations on Actions.
Any claim filed under Article VII and any action filed in any court or other tribunal by or on behalf of a former or current
Employee, Member , Dependant or any other individual, person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful
denial of Plan benefits must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of
this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than
earlier of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action; (ii)
the date identified to the Petitioner by the V ice President on which payments shall commence; or (iii) when he has actual or
constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this
two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of action.
Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals process described above shall have no ef fect on this
two-year time frame.
22
 
7.05    Restriction of V enue.
 
Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner shall
only be brought or filed in the state or federal courts of New Y ork, specifically the state or federal court, whichever applies,
located nearest the Corporation’ s headquarters.
7.06    Effect of Specific Refer ences.
Specific references in the Plan to the V ice President’ s discretion shall create no inference that the V ice President’ s
discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.
7.07    Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’ s Claims Pr ocedur es Befor e Filing in Court.
Before filing any Claim (as defined below in this Section), including a suit or other action, in a court or in another
tribunal, a Claimant (as defined below in this Section) must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’ s rights under the claims
procedure in Section 7.03.
(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.06 is intended to be
interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary to clarify or ef fect this
intent may be taken). For example, exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a Claim unless the
purported Claimant took suf ficient steps to make it reasonably clear to the V ice President that the purported Claimant was
submitting a Claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for documents unless (A) this Plan or
applicable law requires the documents to be provided in response to the request, (B) the Claimant requests such
documents in a writing that is addressed to and actually received by the V ice President, (C) the V ice President fails to
provide the requested documents within 6 months after the date the request is received, or within such longer period as
may be reasonable under the facts and circumstances, and (D) the requestor took suf ficient steps to make it reasonably
clear to the Plan Administrator that the requestor was asserting a legal right to the documents. Accordingly , without
limitation, a purported Claimant or requestor who was not treated as a Member shall not be deemed to have taken
sufficient steps for purposes of the prior sentence unless he makes it reasonably clear to the V ice President that he is
claiming to have been entitled to be a Member .
(b)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.06 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other Disputes (as
defined below in this Section) that are not Claims (including those that a court or other tribunal might consider at the
same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the V ice President may choose to provide in
connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential, and
(iv) even if the V ice President has not previously defined or established specific claims procedures that directly apply to
the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the V ice President, upon notice of the Claim) shall either
promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act by analogy to) the claims procedures of Section 7.03 that
apply to claims for benefits).
(c)    The V ice President may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis or to address unusual
conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in
23
these respects shall be made as are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.
(e)    For purposes of this Section 7.06, the following definitions apply .
(1)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, assertion, action or other matter .
(2)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of the following –
(A)    The interpretation of the Plan;
(B)    The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan;
(C)    The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light of applicable law;
(D)    Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been validly adopted or put into
effect;
(E)    The administration of the Plan;
(F)    Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms, conditions or requirements of
applicable law or regulation, regardless of whether such terms, conditions or requirements are, in whole or in part,
incorporated into the terms, conditions or requirements of the Plan;
(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;
(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any legal duty; or
(I)    Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the V ice President, or (ii)
relates to the Plan in any way .
It is the V ice President’ s intent to interpret and operate the Plan in good faith and at all times consistently with any
requirements of applicable law . Therefore, as a condition for any right or recovery related to the Plan, the Plan imposes a
contractual obligation for complete exhaustion under this Section with respect to any Claim (as defined above) in order to
allow for the ef ficient and uniform resolution of such Claims and to protect the Plan from potentially substantial and
unnecessary litigation expenses that exhaustion could obviate.
(3)    A “Claimant” is any actual or putative Eligible Employee, former Eligible Employee, Member ,
former Member , Dependant (or the spouse, former spouse, estate, heir or representative of any of the foregoing
individuals), or any other individual, person, entity with a relationship to any of the foregoing individuals or the Plan, as
well as any group of one or more of the foregoing, who has a Claim.
24
ARTICLE VIII - AMENDMENT AND TERMINA TION
8.01    Continuation of the Plan.
While the Corporation intends to continue the Plan indefinitely , it assumes no contractual obligation as to its continuance.
The Corporation hereby reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any time
provided, however , that no such amendment or termination shall adversely af fect the amount of benefit to which a Member or his
Dependant is entitled under the Plan on the date of such amendment or termination, unless the Member becomes entitled to an
amount equal to such benefit under another plan or practice adopted by the Corporation. Specific forms of payment are not
protected under the preceding sentence.
8.02    Amendment.
The Corporation may , in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to the Plan from time to time, with or
without retroactive ef fect, subject to Section 8.01. An Employer (other than the Corporation) shall not have the right to amend the
Plan.
8.03    Termination.
The Corporation may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as to the participation of one or more Employers.
If the Plan is terminated with respect to fewer than all of the Employers, the Plan shall continue in ef fect for the benefit of the
employees of the remaining Employers.
25
ARTICLE IX - MISCELLANEOUS
9.01    Unfunded Plan.
The Employers’ obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Employer payable
when due out of the Employer ’s general funds. To the extent a Member or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits
under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Employer .
9.02    Costs of the Plan.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Corporation, all costs, char ges and expenses of or incidental to the administration and
management of the Plan shall be the costs, char ges and expenses of the Employers and shall be paid by each Employer based on
the proportion of Members who are employed by such Employer as compared to the total number of Members at the time the cost
or expense is incurred.
9.03    Temporary Absence of Member .
If a Member is absent from duty by reason other than death, dischar ge, retirement or quitting ( e.g., sickness, accident,
layof f, vacation), he shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that is 12 months after the date on which he is
absent, unless the V ice President determines otherwise. If the Member ’s absence from duty is by reason of his service as a full-
time member of the armed forces of any country or of any or ganization engaged in national service of any such country , he shall
not be deemed to have terminated employment so long as he is regarded by the Employer as remaining in employment or until he
shall resign permanently from employment, whichever shall first occur .
9.04    Taxes, Etc.
In the event any tax or assessment or other duty is determined by the V ice President to be owing in respect of any benefit
payable from the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to withhold an amount not exceeding the amount of any such tax or assessment
or other duty from the benefit payable and shall apply the same in satisfaction of said tax or assessment or other duty .
9.05    Nonguarantee of Employment.
Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any of its employees, or as
a right of any such employee to continue in the employment of the Employer , or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to
dischar ge any of its employees, with or without cause.
9.06    No Right to Benefits.
No person, whether or not being a Member , shall have any claim, right or interest under the Plan except as provided by
the terms of the Plan. In the event of a Member ’s termination of employment by an Employer , the resulting cessation of his
Active Membership shall not be grounds for any damages or any increase in damages in any action brought against the Employer
or any member of the PepsiCo Or ganization with respect to such termination.
26
9.07    Charges on Benefits and Recovery of Excess Payments.
All benefits in respect of a Member under the Plan shall stand char ged with and be subject to deductions therefrom of all
sums in respect of losses to a member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer or otherwise caused by misdemeanor of the
Member and on production by the member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer of proof satisfactory to the V ice President
that any such loss ought to be made good by a Member . The relevant amount shall be deductible from the Member ’s benefits and
be payable to the Employer or member of the PepsiCo Or ganization whose receipt shall be a valid dischar ge for the same.
Payments to, for or in connection with a Member that are made (as of a point in time and to any person or entity) may not
exceed the exact amount of payments that are due as of such time and to such person, as provided by the terms of the Plan that
specify the amounts that are payable, the time as of which they are payable, and the person to whom they are payable.
Accordingly , any such excess payment or any other overpayment, premature payment or misdirected payment (one or more of
which are hereafter referred to as an “Excess Payment”) may not be retained by the party receiving it, but must be restored
promptly to the Plan. In exchange for Member or Dependant status hereunder (or for having any other direct or indirect right or
claim of right from the Plan, or solely as a result of having received an Excess Payment), any party receiving an Excess Payment
grants to the Plan the following nonexclusive rights –
(1)    A constructive trust and first priority equitable lien on any payment that is received directly or
indirectly from the Plan and that is, in whole or part, an Excess Payment (such trust and lien shall be equal to the
amount of the Excess Payment increased by appropriate interest) or upon the proceeds or substitutes for such
payment, and any transfer shall be subject to such constructive trust and equitable lien (including a transfer to a
person, trust fund or entity).
(2)    The right to of fset (as necessary to recover the Excess Payment with appropriate interest)
other payments that are properly payable by the Plan to the recipient of the Excess Payment; however , reliance on
this right is in the discretion of the V ice President, and the existence of an opportunity to apply it shall not
diminish the Plan’ s rights under paragraph (1) above.
(3)    The right to bring any equitable or legal action or proceeding with respect to the enforcement
of any rights in this Section in any court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect, and following receipt of
an Excess Payment the Member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving any and all rights that may
correspond to such party’ s present or future residence.
Any party receiving an Excess Payment shall promptly take all actions requested by the V ice President that are in
furtherance of the Plan’ s recovery of the Excess Payment with appropriate interest. In all cases, this subsection shall
maximize the rights of the Plan to recover improper payments and shall not restrict the rights of the Plan in any way ,
including with respect to any improper payment that is not addressed above.
9.08    Termination for Cause; Pr ohibited Misconduct.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the V ice President determines that a
Member has been terminated for cause or engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary
of the date his or her employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization terminates, the Member shall forfeit his Pension
(whether paid previously , being paid currently or payable in the future), and his or her Pension shall be adjusted to reflect
such forfeiture and any previously paid Pension payments shall be recovered. As a condition to Membership in this Plan,
each Member
27
agrees to this, and each Member agrees to repay PepsiCo the amounts it seeks to recover under this Section 9.08.
(b) Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly , by a Member shall constitute Prohibited
Misconduct:
(1) The Member accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility , or acquiring any
ownership interest, which involves the Member ’s “Participation” (as defined below) in a business entity that
markets, sells, distributes or produces “Covered Products” (as defined below), unless such business entity makes
retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
(2) The Member , directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Member ’s
recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Or ganization employee to leave the
PepsiCo Or ganization’ s employment or to accept any position with any other entity .
(3) The Member using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo
Organization other than as necessary in his or her position with the PepsiCo Or ganization. Such confidential
information shall include all non-public information the Member acquired as a result of his or her positions with
the PepsiCo Or ganization. Examples of such confidential information include non-public information about the
PepsiCo Or ganization’ s customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition tar gets; its business operations
and structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and
know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.
(4) The Member engaging in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the PepsiCo Or ganization’ s best
interests, including violating the Corporation’ s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of
the Corporation or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his or her employment with
the PepsiCo Or ganization, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
(5) The Member engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud.
28
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Member from
communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the Corporation,
participating in government investigations, and/or receiving any applicable award for providing information to
government authorities. The Corporation nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any
information appropriately protected by the privilege. Further , pursuant to the Defend T rade Secrets Act, an individual
shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret
that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government of ficial, either directly or indirectly , or to an
attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a
complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who
files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the
attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any
document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order .
For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director , officer,
employee, consultant or contractor with respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or
suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or testimonial on behalf of such a business
entity or one or more products it produces. For purposes of this subsection, “Covered Products” shall mean any product
that falls into one or more of the following categories, so long as the PepsiCo Or ganization is producing, marketing,
selling or licensing such product anywhere in the world – beverages, including without limitation carbonated soft drinks,
tea, water , juice drinks, sports drinks, cof fee drinks, ener gy drinks, and value-added dairy drinks; juices and juice
products; dairy products; snacks, including salty snacks, sweet snacks meat snacks, granola and cereal bars, and cookies;
hot cereals; pancake mixes; value-added rice products; pancake syrups; value-added pasta products; ready-to-eat cereals;
dry pasta products; or any product or service that the Member had reason to know was under development by the PepsiCo
Organization during the Member ’s employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
9.09    Notices.
Any notice which under the Plan is required to be given to or served upon the Plan shall be deemed to be suf ficiently
given to or served upon the Plan if it is in writing and delivered to the V ice President. In any case where under the Plan any
notice shall be required to be given to Members, it shall be suf ficient if such notice is delivered to the Member ’s last known
address on file in the records of the Employer or delivered to the Member pursuant to any other method ( e.g., electronically) that
the V ice President determines is reasonably available to the Member .
9.10    Plan Documentation.
Every Member shall on demand be entitled to a copy of the governing legal document for the DB Program.
9.11    Curr ency of Payment.
Payment of benefits under the Plan shall be made in United States dollars, or other "eligible currency ," as approved by the
Vice President. For both annuity and lump sum payments, the amount otherwise payable in United States dollars would be
converted to the
29
selected currency using the exchange rate, based on the methodology approved by the V ice President from time to time.
9.12    Governing Law .
The Plan shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New Y ork.
9.13    Exemption fr om ERISA.
The Plan is intended to be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”),
as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident
aliens of the United States. In order to preserve this exemption from ERISA, both Active Membership in the Plan and the
opportunity to increase Highest A verage Monthly Earnings after ceasing to be an Active Member , in accordance with Section
4.04(b), shall be limited to individuals who are nonresident aliens of the United States and whose assigned work locations are
outside the United States, and it is intended that all permanent records and documentation relating to the administration of the
Plan shall be kept at a location that is outside of the United States.
9.14    Exemption fr om Section 409A.
In order to permit this Plan to be completely exempt from United States Internal Revenue Code section 409A (“Section
409A”), this Plan shall be subject to the special operating rules and limitations in this Section 9.14, ef fective for any period to
which Section 409A applies. It is the intent of the Plan that no Member who is a U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit
from the Plan vest, increase or in any way be enhanced (collectively , a “Benefit Enhancement”) as a result of their compensation
or service while a U.S. Person. Accordingly , no Member shall become entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a
calendar year until it is determined, following the close of such year , that the Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such
year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the calendar year a Member ’s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence,
the V ice President may authorize a Benefit Enhancement for the calendar year of benefit commencement to the extent the V ice
President determines satisfactorily that the Member will not be a U.S. Person for such year . In other cases, the Member ’s benefit
will commence under this Plan without any Benefit Enhancement related to the calendar year of commencement, and appropriate
adjustments will be made to the Member ’s benefit in the following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person
in such calendar year of commencement. This Section 9.14 shall at all times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the
overriding requirement that benefits and any other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A, and the
Vice President shall have such unrestricted authority as is necessary to ensure that it is applied in accordance with this
requirement.

TABLE A - CALCULA TION OF PENSIONS
    This section sets forth the formulas for calculating the Pension payable to a Member under Article IV or the Death Benefit
payable to a Member ’s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as applicable, under Article VI, but subject in all cases to
the freeze of the Plan described in Article I. Any benefits accrued under the DB Program by a Member while a part-time
employee, following such Member ’s designation by the V ice President as an Eligible Employee pursuant to the last sentence of
the definition of Eligible Employee in Section 2.01, shall be prorated as determined by the V ice President to reflect the
approximate ratio of the Member ’s level of services during such part-time status to the level required for full-time status at the
Member ’s work location.
(I)    Member ’s Pension
(a)    The Pension payable (as a Single Life Annuity benefit) on retirement at Normal Retirement Date for Members who
became members of the Plan before January 1, 1976 shall be the larger of the Pension calculated under this paragraph (a) or
under paragraph (b) below . The Pension under this paragraph (a) shall be the greater  of (1) or (2) below:
    (1)    1.5 percent of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the number of
years of Pensionable Service; or
    (2)    3 percent of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary , multiplied by the number of years of his Pensionable
Service but not exceeding 15 years.
(b)    The Pension payable (as a Single Life Annuity benefit) on retirement at Normal Retirement Date (i) for Members
who became members of the Plan on or after January 1, 1976, and (ii) for persons (other than those in (i)) who became Members
on or after September 1, 1980, and (iii) for persons (other than in (i) or (ii)) who became Members after November 12, 1998,
shall be the Pension calculated under this paragraph (b). The pension calculated under this paragraph (b) shall be the aggregate
of:
(1)    For up to the first 10 years of Pensionable Service, the product of (i) 3 percent of the Member ’s Highest
Average Monthly Salary , multiplied by (ii) the number of years of Pensionable Service, but not exceeding 10 such years;
plus
(2)    For any years of Pensionable Service in excess of 10, the product of (i) 1 percent of the Member ’s Highest
Average Monthly Salary , multiplied by (ii) the number of years of Pensionable Service in excess of 10.
(c)    At the discretion of the V ice President, the Pension calculated as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be
reduced by some or all of the following:
(1)    All state pension and social security benefits receivable by the Member attributable to Service other than
those derived from unmatched and unreimbursed voluntary contributions made by the Member;
(2)    The annuity equivalent of a like portion of all capital sum benefits receivable by the Member on or by reason
of his retirement either from a state source or from the Employer in consequence of a requirement of local legislation,
including, but not limited to, termination indemnities;
32
(3)    Any benefits payable to the Member (or in respect of him) from other retirement benefit plans (or cash
allowance received in lieu of Employer contributions to a retirement benefit plan) of the Employers in respect of any
period of employment which qualifies as Pensionable Service both under the DB Program and under such other
retirement benefit plans of the Employers;
(4)    Any other payment made by the Employer at the time of termination of the Member that arises from any
severance agreement made between the Employer and Member , for whatsoever reason;
    (5)    The value (as determined in accordance with methodology approved by the V ice President) of any benefits paid to
the Member prior to his retirement from any plan in respect of any period of employment which qualifies as Pensionable
Service both under the DB Program and under such other retirement benefit plans of the Employers;
(6)    Any deductions, reductions or forfeiture of a Member's benefits resulting from a Member's misdemeanor ,
misconduct or dischar ge for cause pursuant to Section 9.08 hereof.
No such deduction shall be made in respect of any such benefits as are derived from unmatched and unreimbursed
voluntary contributions made by the Member . The value of all such deductions shall be subject to adjustment to reflect the form
and timing of payment. All deductions set out in this paragraph (c) shall be calculated as of the Member ’s termination date and in
accordance with methodology approved by the V ice President from time to time.
(d)    If the Pension payable to or on behalf of a Member is reduced under paragraph (c) above, an alternative calculation
of the Pension for such Member shall apply unless the V ice President determines that the alternative calculation would be
unnecessary or impractical or would not serve the purposes of the DB Program. Under this alternative calculation, only the
Member ’s Pensionable Service under this DB Program, which does not include any employment that is taken into account in
determining benefits under paragraph (c)(1) - (5), shall be considered, and the reductions under paragraph (c)(1) - (5) shall be
disregarded (however , the reduction under paragraph (c)(6) shall be taken into account). If this alternative calculation applies, the
Pension payable under this alternative calculation shall be compared to the Pension payable under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)
above, and whichever provides the greater Pension amount will be payable to or on behalf of the Member , subject to the
remaining provisions of this paragraph (d). The alternative calculation set forth in this paragraph (d) is intended to provide a
calculation methodology that replicates the ef fect of the “extended wearaway” calculation methodology , as it is in ef fect from
time to time under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this paragraph (d), any benefit increase
provided as a result of this paragraph (d) will be limited so that in the judgment of the V ice President it is not in excess of what
should be available given the intent described in the preceding sentence.
(e)    For purposes of this T able A, "Highest A verage Monthly Salary" means one twelfth of the yearly average of the
Member ’s Salary over any 5 consecutive calendar years of Service in which such Salary was highest (or over such lesser period
as the Member has been in Service). For purposes of determining a Member's Highest A verage Monthly Salary , the following
shall apply:
    (1)    A calendar year with no Salary shall be disregarded, and the calendar years preceding and following such calendar
year (or years) shall be considered consecutive.
33
(2)    If in a calendar year there is an unpaid authorised leave of absence, or other absence from paid service, that
results in less than a complete year of Salary , such calendar year shall be disregarded and the next preceding or
succeeding year or years shall be taken into account if it results in a higher average.
(f)    In determining the amount of a Deferred V ested Pension for the purposes of Section 4.04, the Pension shall be equal
to the greatest of the amounts determined under subsection (1), (2) or (3) below:
(1)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would
have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Age (subject to a maximum of 35 years) and
Highest A verage Monthly Salary as of September 30, 2003, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Member ’s actual years of Pensionable Service prior to October 1, 2003 (subject to a maximum of 35 years) and the
denominator of which is the years of Pensionable Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until
his Normal Retirement Age.
(2)    The aggregate of:
(i)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member
would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date and Highest A verage
Monthly Salary as of September 30, 2003, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Member ’s actual
years of Pensionable Service prior to October 1, 2003 and the denominator of which is the years of Pensionable
Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date; and
(ii)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member
would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date and the Highest A verage
Monthly Salary at the date the Member ceases to be in Service, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the Member ’s actual years of Pensionable Service after September 30, 2003 and the denominator of which is the
years of Pensionable Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal
Retirement Date.
(3)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would
have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date  and the Highest A verage Monthly
Salary at the date the Member ceases to be in Service, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Member ’s
actual years of Pensionable Service and the denominator of which is the years of Pensionable Service he would have
earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date.
For Members who became Members of the Plan before January 1, 1976, the Deferred V ested Pension shall be the
larger of 1½ percent of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary multiplied by the Member ’s number of years of
Pensionable Service at termination or the amount determined by the V ice President based on actuarial information
provided to the V ice President.
All deductions set out in (c) above that are applicable to a Member entitled to a Deferred V ested Pension shall be
calculated as of the time such Member ceases to be in Service and in accordance with methodology approved by the V ice
President.
34
(II)    Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension
    If a Member covered by Section 6.01 dies after the date he would have been entitled to retire early under Section 4.02, the Pre-
Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension, as applicable, shall be 50 percent of the Pension to
which the Member would have been entitled if he had retired on the day preceding his death (having elected a 50 Percent
Survivor Annuity calculated in accordance with Section 5.02(b)) and reduced in accordance with Section 4.02 if the Eligible
Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner commences the Pre-Retirement Souse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s
Pension, as applicable, prior to the date the Member would have attained age 62. If a Member covered by Section 6.01 dies
before the date he would have been entitled to retire early under Section 4.02, the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-
Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension, as applicable, shall be 50 percent of the Pension to which the Member would have been
entitled if he had attained the right to receive a 50 Percent Survivor Annuity calculated in accordance with Section 5.02(b)),
payable as of the first of the month following the later of death or the date the Member would have attained age 55, and reduced
in accordance with Section 4.04(c) if the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner commences the Pre-Retirement Souse’ s
Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension, as applicable, prior to the date the Member would have attained age 65.

ARTICLE I – HIST ORY AND GENERAL INFORMA TION
    PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Corporation”) first established the PepsiCo International Retirement Plan ef fective as of September 1,
1980. The Plan at that time was comprised of the “PepsiCo International Retirement Plan T rust Indenture” and the “Plan Rules.”
The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety , effective September 2, 1982.
    The Plan was again amended and restated ef fective October 1, 2003, whereupon the Plan Rules became the “Plan A Rules”
(applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation’ s contributions to the trust established by the PepsiCo International Retirement
Plan T rust Indenture) and the “Plan B Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation as they arise) took ef fect.
    The Plan was further amended ef fective January 1, 2005, to provide that no person subject to taxation in the United States of
America may in any way have their right to a benefit from the Plan come into existence, increase or in any way be enhanced, but
instead will be determined as if they had left the Corporation and any Associated Company permanently before becoming subject
to U.S. taxation.
    Ef fective January 1, 2010, the Plan A Rules and Plan B Rules were amended and restated in their entirety to form one Plan
document. The amendment and restatement referred to in the prior sentence remains in ef fect, and it sets forth the terms of the
“DB Program.”
    Ef fective January 1, 201 1, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit
selected international employees for whom it has been determined to be appropriate ( i.e., employees on assignments outside of
their home countries for whom it is judged to be impractical to have them participate in their home country retirement plans, and
employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages). The terms of the DC
Program are set forth in this document, which is the governing legal document for the DC Program. Together , the DC Program
and the DB Program set forth the terms of a single Plan. The DC Program is also sometimes referred to in employee
communications as the PepsiCo International Pension Plan or “PIPP .”
    The DC Program was previously amended and restated, ef fective as of January 1, 2016. As part of that amendment and
restatement, the Corporation modified the DC Program to also benefit selected employees: (i) who are localized to a country
outside of their home country , (ii) were participating in a defined benefit or defined contribution retirement program sponsored
immediately prior to their localization and (iii) for whom no company-provided retirement program is available.
    The DC Program was again amended and restated ef fective as of January 1, 2019. As part of that amendment and restatement,
the Corporation modified the DC Program to recognize same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners for certain purposes for
Members actively employed or on authorized leave of absence on and after January 1, 2019. The DC Program was again
amended and restated ef fective as of January 1, 2021.
    The DC Program is now hereby amended and restated ef fective as of January 1, 2022.
    At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the United States Internal Revenue Code and Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that
executive’ s individual employer . With respect to his employer , the executive has the rights of an unsecured general creditor . The
Plan is also intended to be exempt from ERISA as a plan maintained outside of the
1
United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States.

Corporation or an Af filiated Company ( e.g., a case where only a statutory plan is available to the individual);
(3) The individual is among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages
whose positions and employment terms are among those that the V ice President has determined make them

Year to which an Interest Credit relates. The V ice President shall have the discretion to change from time to time the basis
for determining the Interest Rate as necessary to ensure that the Interest Rate is readily determinable and administrable,
and that it can be reasonably expected to provide substantially a market rate of interest

applied by the V ice President.
(v) “Salary ” means (i) home notional base salary in the case of an Eligible Employee who is not paid on a United

Employees not paid on a United States payroll who become an Active Member on or after January 1, 2021. In the case of
an Eligible Employee who is employed in a country other than the United States, the V ice President may authorize the
Eligible Employee’ s Salary to be increased to reflect an amount of notional bonus that is paid to such Eligible Employee.
The determination of an Eligible Employee’ s Salary in accordance with the preceding three sentences shall be made by
the V ice President and shall be conclusive and binding on all Eligible Employees.
(w) “Service ” means the period during which an Eligible Employee was continuously in employment with any

who transfers from employment with an Approved Employer as an Eligible Employee to other employment with an
Employer , his post-transfer period of employment with an Employer may be counted as Service only with the approval of
the V ice President. Except as otherwise expressly provided by the V ice President, Service shall not include an individual’ s
periods of employment with any company or undertaking prior to it becoming an Employer or a member of the PepsiCo
Organization.
(x) “Status Change ” means any change in a Member ’s circumstances (other than a change in circumstances that

procedures that are then currently in ef fect. As of the Ef fective Date, the DC Program shall have a V aluation Date for all
Members as of the last day of each Plan Y ear. In addition, to the extent provided in Section 4.02, the DC Program shall
have a special V aluation Date prior to the end of a Plan Y ear for Active Members who have an Approved T ransfer (and
for certain Active Members who have a Status Change) as described in Section 4.02. In accordance with procedures that
may be adopted by the V ice President, any current V aluation Date may be changed (but in such case adjustments shall
apply in the operation of the DC Program as necessary to prevent duplicate or disproportionate benefits, as determined by

7
(b) Determining Periods of Y ears:  For the purposes of the DC Program, any period of 365 consecutive days (or of
366 consecutive days, if the period includes 29  February) shall be deemed to constitute a year , but not so that in the
calculation of a number of years any day is counted more than once. Where the amount of a benefit depends upon the
calculation of a number of years or months without expressly requiring that these should be complete years or months, a
proportionate amount ( i.e., a number of days) may be given for any part of a year or month which would not otherwise be
included in the calculation. Where this document makes reference to months or parts of a year , or to any other period of
time except a day , week or year the V ice President may authorize the period to be counted in days or complete calendar
months with each calendar month counted as 1/12th of a year .
(c) Compounds of the W ord “Here”:  The words “hereof” and “hereunder” and other similar compounds of the
word “here” shall mean and refer to the entire DC Program, not to any particular provision or section.     
(d) Examples:  Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item
or items, or there is a passage having a similar ef fect, such passages of the document shall be construed as if the phrase
“without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids
limitation on its breadth of application).
(e) Subdivisions of this Document:  This document is divided and subdivided using the following progression:
articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs and clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals.
Sections are designated by Arabic numerals containing a decimal point. Subsections are designated by lower -case letters
in parentheses. Paragraphs are designated by Arabic numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower -case
roman numerals in parentheses. Clauses are designated by upper -case letters in parentheses. Any reference in a section to
a subsection (with no accompanying section reference) shall be read as a reference to the subsection with the specified
designation contained in that same section. A similar rule shall apply with respect to paragraph references within a
subsection and subparagraph references within a paragraph.th

Entry Date. For this purpose, the relevant time includes a suf ficient period before the Eligible Employee’ s Proposed Entry Date as
is necessary to avoid PIRP-DC Accounts being considered deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A of the United
States Internal Revenue Code. No Eligible Employee or any other person shall be admitted to Membership without the approval
of the V ice President.
3.03    Active and Inactive Membership.
    A Member shall be an Active Member during the period that he is – (a) employed as an Eligible Employee, (b) not a U.S.
Person, and (c) currently approved for status as an Active Member by the V ice President. A Member shall be an Inactive Member
during any period that he does not currently meet all of the requirements to be an Active Member .
9
ARTICLE IV – CONTRIBUTIONS
4.01    Contributions.
To the extent provided in subsections (a) and (b) below , the Employer shall allocate Pay Credits and Interest Credits to a
Member ’s PIRP-DC Account, each determined by the V ice President as follows –
(a) Pay Credit . To receive a Pay Credit for a Plan Y ear, an individual must be an Active Member during such year .
The amount of an Active Member ’s Pay Credit for a Plan Y ear shall be determined by multiplying the Active Member ’s
annualized Salary in ef fect as of that year ’s Valuation Date by the Active Member ’s applicable percentage, which shall be
one of the following: 5%, 8%, 10%, 12% or 18%.
Effective for any Eligible Employee who becomes an Active Member on or after January 1, 2021 and who does
not have any Service completed while a U.S. Person, the amount of the Active Member ’s Pay Credits shall be determined
by the number of “points” attributed to the Active Member in accordance with the following:
Points Amount of Pay Credit
Less than 35 5% of Eligible Pay
35-39 6% of Eligible Pay
40-44 7% of Eligible Pay
45-49 8% of Eligible Pay
50-54 9% of Eligible Pay
55-59 10% of Eligible Pay
60-64 11% of Eligible Pay
65 or more 12% of Eligible Pay
Such an Active Member ’s points shall be determined by the sum of the Active Member ’s age and years of Service, with
each expressed in whole years and days.
Otherwise, the V ice President shall specify the Active Member ’s applicable percentage as of the Active Member ’s
Entry Date (or , if the Member ceases to be an Active Member , and then becomes an Active Member again, as of the date
the Member again becomes an Active Member). For each subsequent Plan Y ear that the individual is an Active Member ,
the V ice President may specify a new applicable percentage that shall apply to the Active Member for such Plan Y ear. An
Active Member shall cease receiving Pay Credits during any Plan Y ear as necessary to ensure (i) that the Active
Member ’s Pay Credits do not exceed the Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) limit in ef fect for such Plan Y ear, and
(ii) that there is ongoing compliance with limitations set forth in Section 9.14. Specifications of an applicable percentage
by the V ice President are made in the V ice President’ s sole discretion, and at no time does an Eligible Employee have a
legally binding right to be assigned any initial or increased applicable percentage.
(b) Interest Credit . To receive an Interest Credit for a Plan Y ear, an individual must be either an Active Member or
Inactive Member during such year , and the individual must have had a balance in his PIRP-DC Account as of the prior
Plan Y ear’s Valuation Date. The amount of a Member ’s Interest Credit shall be determined by the
10
Vice President by multiplying the Interest Rate for the period since the last V aluation Date by the balance of the
Member ’s PIRP-DC Account as of such last V aluation Date.
A Member ’s Pay Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined by the V ice President as soon as administratively practicable after
each V aluation Date. If a Member has less than one full year of Active Membership since such last V aluation Date ( e.g., as may
apply in the Member ’s first and last year of Membership), the Member ’s Pay Credit as otherwise determined under subsection (a)
above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member ’s fractional year of Active Membership. If a Member has less
than one full year of Membership since such last V aluation Date, any Interest Credit as otherwise available and determined under
subsection (b) above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member ’s fractional year of Membership ( e.g., as may
apply in the Member ’s last year of Membership). A fractional year shall be computed by dividing the Member ’s days of
Membership or Active Membership (as applicable) during the Plan Y ear by the total number of days in such Plan Y ear. A period
of paid leave of absence during a Plan Y ear shall be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a
Member ’s Pay Credit for the Plan Y ear in accordance with the prior sentence. However , a period of unpaid leave of absence
during a Plan Y ear shall not be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a Member ’s Pay Credit
for the Plan Y ear in accordance with the prior sentence (and as a result, the Pay Credit for the Plan Y ear containing the unpaid
leave shall be prorated, or there shall be no Pay Credit, all as necessary to limit Pay Credits to the Member ’s period of Active
Membership during the Plan Y ear). In the event a prorated Pay Credit and Interest Credit relate to the Member ’s final year of
Membership, the Pay Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined as of the Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date (with
proration based upon the Member ’s fractional final year of Membership). The calculation of the Pay Credit and Interest Credit by
the V ice President shall be conclusive and binding on all Members (and their Dependants).
4.02    Offsets.
Notwithstanding Section 4.01, the Corporation may reduce the amount of any payment or benefit that is or would become
payable to or on behalf of a Member by the amount of any obligation of the Member to the Corporation or by the amount of –
(a) Any material benefits accrued by the Member under a retirement plan sponsored by the Corporation or by any
country , state, province or other political subdivision or locality , to the extent the V ice President determines that the
benefit amount under such retirement plan is for Service or Salary that is taken into account in providing Pay Credits
under the DC Program, and
(b) Any termination indemnity or other payment to the Member by the Employer or PepsiCo Or ganization related
to the Member ’s termination of employment, to the extent the V ice President determines that the payment is reasonably
related to Service that is taken into account in providing Pay Credits under the DC Program.
Consistent with the foregoing, appropriate reductions may be made in the Pay Credits and Interest Credits that otherwise would
be provided to the Member under Sections 4.01 and 4.02, the balance in the Member ’s PIRP-DC Account under Article V , or the
Member ’s distributions under Article VI. The determination of whether a benefit is material and all other aspects of the
application of this Section 4.02 is solely in the independent discretion of the V ice President.
11
ARTICLE V – MEMBER ACCOUNTS
5.01    Accounting for Members’ Inter ests.
Pay Credits and Interest Credits shall be credited to a Member ’s PIRP-DC Account as of the V aluation Date to which such
credits relate (or , in the case of Pay Credits and Interest Credits that relate to the Member ’s final year of Membership, as of the
Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date) or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter . A Member ’s PIRP-DC Account is a
bookkeeping device to track the notional value of the Member ’s Pay Credits and Interest Credits (and his Employer ’s liability for
such credits). No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with any PIRP-DC Account, and no PIRP-DC Account
shall be funded, insured or otherwise secured.
5.02    Vesting.
Subject to Sections 4.02 and 9.14, a Member shall be fully vested in, and have a nonforfeitable right to, his PIRP-DC
Account upon completing 3 years of Service, or if earlier , upon the death or disability of the Member while employed by the
Employer or PepsiCo Or ganization. The determination of whether a Member has become disabled for this purpose shall be made
by the V ice President in accordance with such standards as the V ice President deems to be appropriate as of the time in question.
5.03    Special V esting for Appr oved T ransfers and Status Changes.
(a) Automatic Special V esting for Approved T ransfers. Notwithstanding Section 5.02 above, in the case of an
Active Member who will have an Approved T ransfer during a Plan Y ear, the Active Member shall automatically have
special vesting apply as of the last business day before the earlier of – (a) the Active Member ’s Approved T ransfer , or (b)
the day the Active Member would become a U.S. Person in connection with the Approved T ransfer .
(b) Special V esting for Status Changes . Also notwithstanding Section 5.02 above, in the case of an Active Member
who will have a Status Change, the Active Member may request that the V ice President apply special vesting to him as of
the last business day before the Active Member ’s Status Change. In order for special vesting related to a Status Change to
be valid and ef fective under the DC Program, the Active Member ’s request and the V ice President’ s approval of the
request must both be completely final and in place prior to the date that the special vesting applies.
Subject to the next sentence, the ef fect of special vesting applying to a Member in accordance with either subsection (a) or (b)
above is that the Member will become vested, to the same extent as could apply under Section 5.02 if the Member vested under
that Section, as of the date that the special vesting applies. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 5.03, rights
under this Section 5.03 are subject to the overriding requirement that allocations, benefits and other rights under the Plan must
remain entirely exempt from Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and this Section 5.03 shall not apply to
the extent inconsistent with this requirement.
12
ARTICLE VI – DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS
6.01    Distribution Rules Generally .
A Member ’s PIRP-DC Account shall be distributed based upon first to occur of the Member ’s termination of employment
with the PepsiCo Or ganization or death, as provided in Sections 6.02 and 6.03 respectively , subject to Section 4.06 (vesting). All
distributions shall be made in cash.
6.02    Distributions Upon T ermination of Employment.
If a Member ’s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his termination of employment with the PepsiCo
Organization, such distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment on the first of the month that immediately follows
the Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date. In the case of a Member whose termination of employment with the PepsiCo
Organization occurs as a result of the Member becoming disabled, for purposes of this Section, the determination of whether such
Member is disabled and the date on which such Member ’s termination of employment is considered to occur shall be made by the
Vice President.
6.03    Distributions Upon Death.
If a Member ’s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his death, such distribution shall be made in a single
lump sum payment on the first day of the month that immediately follows the Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date. Amounts
paid following a Member ’s death shall be paid to the Member ’s Dependant; provided, however , that if no Dependant designation
is in ef fect at the time of the Member ’s death (as determined by the V ice President), or if all persons designated as Dependants
have predeceased the Member , then the payments to be made pursuant to this Section shall be distributed to the Member ’s
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as applicable, or , if the Member does not have an Eligible Spouse or an Eligible
Domestic Partner at the time of his death, to his estate.
6.04    Valuation.
In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article, the Member ’s PIRP-DC Account shall
continue to be credited with Interest Credits (and debited for expenses) as specified in Article V until the Member ’s Distribution
Valuation Date.
6.05    Designation of Dependant.
A Member shall designate one or more Dependants who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death. A Member
shall have the right to change or revoke his Dependant designation at any time prior to the ef fective date of such election. If the
Member is married at the time he or she designates a Dependant(s), any designation under this section of a Dependant(s) who is
not the Member ’s Eligible Spouse shall require the written consent of the Member ’s Eligible Spouse. A revocation of a
Dependant(s) does not require consent by the Member ’s Eligible Spouse. The designation of any Dependant(s), and any change
or revocation thereof, and any written consent of a Member ’s Eligible Spouse required by this Section shall be made in
accordance with rules adopted by the V ice President, shall be made in writing on forms provided by the V ice President, and shall
not be ef fective unless and until filed with the V ice President.
13
ARTICLE VII – ADMINISTRA TION
7.01    Authority to Administer Plan.
(a) Administration by the V ice President:  The Plan shall be administered by the V ice President, who shall have the
authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as he deems appropriate. All actions by the V ice President
hereunder may be taken in his sole discretion, and all interpretations, determinations and regulations made or issued by
the V ice President shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned.
(b) Authority to Delegate:  The V ice President may delegate any of his responsibilities under the Plan to other
persons or entities, or designate or employ other persons to carry out any of his duties, responsibilities or other functions
under the Plan. Any reference in the Plan to an action by the V ice President shall, to the extent applicable, refer to such
action by the V ice President’ s delegate or other designated person.
7.02    Facility of Payment.
Whenever , in the opinion of the V ice President, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit hereunder is under a
legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the V ice President may direct that
payments from the Plan be made to such person’ s legal representative for his benefit, or that the payment be applied for the
benefit of such person in such manner as the V ice President considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall be a complete dischar ge of any liability for the making of such payment under the provisions of
the Plan.
7.03    Claims Pr ocedur e.
    The V ice President shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions
of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits, and his decisions on such matters are final and conclusive.
As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the V ice President decides in his discretion that the person claiming such
benefits is entitled to them. Any decisions or determinations hereunder shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted discretion
of the V ice President, even if (i) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or (ii) a decision or
determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions expressly
grant discretion or expressly call for a decision or determination. This discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in
any case where the extent of this discretion is in question, the V ice President is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible.
Any exercise of this discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and
capricious standard ( i.e., the abuse of discretion standard). All decisions and determinations made by the V ice President shall be
final, conclusive, and binding on all parties. The V ice President may consider the intent of the Corporation with respect to a Plan
provision in making any determination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the provisions set forth in any document
that ar guably do not contemplate considering such intent.
If, pursuant to this discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit or any other right related to the Plan (a
“claim”), by or on behalf of a Member , putative Member , Dependant or putative Dependant (a “claimant”), is wholly or partially
denied, the V ice President, or a party designated by the V ice President, will provide such claimant the claims procedure described
in this section. The V ice President has the discretionary authority to modify
14
the claims procedure described in this Section in any manner so long as the claims review process, as modified, includes the basic
steps described in this Section. In the event of a claim by a claimant, the V ice President or the designated party shall provide the
claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the V ice President, a comprehensible written notice
setting forth:
(1) The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
 
(2) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
 
(3) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the claim
and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
 
(4) A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process).
If the V ice President determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim he may
extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the V ice President will notify the claimant before the end of the
initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President
expects to make the final decision. Upon review , the V ice President shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim,
including the opportunity to submit to the V ice President comments, document, records and other information relevant to the
claim and the V ice President’ s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of
whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after
receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this
occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special
circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President expects to make the final decision. The final
decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the
decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to
receive, upon request and free of char ge, copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his or her claim for
benefits.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis
of the record before the V ice President at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on
the claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this section and in accordance with Section 7.07.
 
7.04    Limitations on Actions.
Any claim filed under Article VII and any action filed in any court or other tribunal by or on behalf of a former or current
Employee, Member , Dependant or any other individual, person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful
denial of Plan benefits must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of
this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than
earlier of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action; (ii)
the date identified to the Petitioner by the V ice President on which payments shall commence; or (iii) when he has actual or
constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this
two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of action.
Correspondence or
15
other communications following the mandatory appeals process described above shall have no ef fect on this two-year time frame.
 
7.05    Restriction of V enue.
 
Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner shall
only be brought or filed in the state or federal courts of New Y ork, specifically the state or federal court, whichever applies,
located nearest the Corporation’ s headquarters.
7.06    Effect of Specific Refer ences.
Specific references in the Plan to the V ice President’ s discretion shall create no inference that the V ice President’ s
discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.
7.07    Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’ s Claims Pr ocedur es Befor e Filing in Court.
Before filing any Claim (as defined below in this Section), including a suit or other action, in a court or in another
tribunal, a Claimant (as defined below in this Section) must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’ s rights under the claims
procedure in Section 7.03.
(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.07 is intended to be
interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary to clarify or ef fect this
intent may be taken). For example, exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a Claim unless the
purported Claimant took suf ficient steps to make it reasonably clear to the V ice President that the purported Claimant was
submitting a Claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for documents unless (A) this Plan or
applicable law requires the documents to be provided in response to the request, (B) the Claimant requests such
documents in a writing that is addressed to and actually received by the V ice President, (C) the V ice President fails to
provide the requested documents within 6 months after the date the request is received, or within such longer period as
may be reasonable under the facts and circumstances, and (D) the requestor took suf ficient steps to make it reasonably
clear to the Plan Administrator that the requestor was asserting a legal right to the documents. Accordingly , without
limitation, a purported Claimant or requestor who was not treated as a Member shall not be deemed to have taken
sufficient steps for purposes of the prior sentence unless he makes it reasonably clear to the V ice President that he is
claiming to have been entitled to be a Member .
(b)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.06 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other Disputes (as
defined below in this Section) that are not Claims (including those that a court or other tribunal might consider at the
same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the V ice President may choose to provide in
connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential, and
(iv) even if the V ice President has not previously defined or established specific claims procedures that directly apply to
the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the V ice President, upon notice of the Claim) shall either
promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act by analogy to) the claims procedures of Section 7.03 that
apply to claims for benefits).
(c)    The V ice President may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis or to address unusual
conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in
16
these respects shall be made as are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.
(d)    For purposes of this Section 7.07, the following definitions apply .
(1)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, assertion, action or other matter .
(2)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of the following –
(A)    The interpretation of the Plan;
(B)    The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan;
(C)    The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light of applicable law;
(D)    Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been validly adopted or put into
effect;
(E)    The administration of the Plan;
(F)    Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms, conditions or requirements of
applicable law or regulation, regardless of whether such terms, conditions or requirements are, in whole or in part,
incorporated into the terms, conditions or requirements of the Plan;
(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;
(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any legal duty; or
(I)    Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the V ice President, or (ii)
relates to the Plan in any way .
It is the V ice President’ s intent to interpret and operate the Plan in good faith and at all times consistently with any
requirements of applicable law . Therefore, as a condition for any right or recovery related to the Plan, the Plan imposes a
contractual obligation for complete exhaustion under this Section with respect to any Claim (as defined above) in order to
allow for the ef ficient and uniform resolution of such Claims and to protect the Plan from potentially substantial and
unnecessary litigation expenses that exhaustion could obviate.
(3)    A “Claimant” is any actual or putative Eligible Employee, former Eligible Employee, Member ,
former Member , Dependant (or the spouse, former spouse, estate, heir or representative of any of the foregoing
individuals), or any other individual, person, entity with a relationship to any of the foregoing individuals or the Plan, as
well as any group of one or more of the foregoing, who has a Claim.
17
ARTICLE VIII – AMENDMENT AND TERMINA TION
8.01    Continuation of the Plan.
While the Corporation intends to continue the Plan indefinitely , it assumes no contractual obligation as to its continuance.
The Corporation hereby reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any time
provided, however , that no such amendment or termination shall reduce the balance (determined as of the date of such
amendment or termination) in the Plan account maintained for the benefit of a Member or his Dependant, except to the extent the
Member becomes entitled to an amount under another plan or practice maintained by an Employer . Specific forms (including
times) of payment are not protected under the preceding sentence. The Corporation’ s rights under this Article VIII shall be as
broad as permissible under applicable law .
8.02    Amendment.
The Corporation may , in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to this Plan from time to time, with or
without retroactive ef fect, subject to Section 8.01. An Employer (other than the Corporation) shall not have the right to amend the
Plan.
8.03    Termination.
The Corporation may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as to the participation of one or more Employers.
If the Plan is terminated with respect to fewer than all of the Employers, the Plan shall continue in ef fect for the benefit of the
employees of the remaining Employers.
18
ARTICLE IX – MISCELLANEOUS
9.01    Unfunded Plan.
The Employers’ obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Employer payable
when due out of the Employer ’s general funds. To the extent a Member or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits
under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Employer .
9.02    Costs of the Plan.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Corporation, all costs, char ges and expenses of or incidental to the administration and
management of the Plan shall be the costs, char ges and expenses of the Employers and shall be paid by each Employer based on
the proportion of Members who are employed by such Employer as compared to the total number of Members at the time the cost
or expense is incurred.
9.03    Temporary Absence of Member .
If a Member is absent from duty by reason other than death, dischar ge, retirement or quitting ( e.g., sickness, accident,
layof f, vacation), he shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that is 12 months after the date on which he is
absent, unless the V ice President determines otherwise. If the Member ’s absence from duty is by reason of his service as a full-
time member of the armed forces of any country or of any or ganization engaged in national service of any such country , he shall
not be deemed to have terminated employment so long as he is regarded by the Employer as remaining in employment or until he
shall resign permanently from employment, whichever shall first occur .
9.04    Taxes, Etc.
In the event any tax or assessment or other duty is determined by the V ice President to be owing in respect of any benefit
payable from the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to withhold an amount not exceeding the amount of any such tax or assessment
or other duty from the benefit payable and shall apply the same in satisfaction of said tax or assessment or other duty .
9.05    Nonguarantee of Employment.
Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any of its employees, or as
a right of any such employee to continue in the employment of the Employer , or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to
dischar ge any of its employees, with or without cause.
9.06    No Right to Benefits.
No person, whether or not being a Member , shall have any claim, right or interest under the Plan except as provided by
the terms of the Plan. In the event of a Member ’s termination of employment by an Employer , the resulting cessation of his
Membership shall not be grounds for any damages or any increase in damages in any action brought against the Employer or any
member of the PepsiCo Or ganization with respect to such termination.
19
9.07    Charges on Benefits and Recovery of Excess Payments.
All benefits in respect of a Member under the Plan shall stand char ged with and be subject to deductions therefrom of all
sums in respect of losses to a member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer or otherwise caused by misdemeanor of the
Member and on production by the member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer of proof satisfactory to the V ice President
that any such loss ought to be made good by a Member . The relevant amount shall be deductible from the Member ’s benefits and
be payable to the Employer or member of the PepsiCo Or ganization whose receipt shall be a valid dischar ge for the same.
Payments to, for or in connection with a Member that are made (as of a point in time and to any person or entity) may not
exceed the exact amount of payments that are due as of such time and to such person, as provided by the terms of the Plan that
specify the amounts that are payable, the time as of which they are payable, and the person to whom they are payable.
Accordingly , any such excess payment or any other overpayment, premature payment or misdirected payment (one or more of
which are hereafter referred to as an “Excess Payment”) may not be retained by the party receiving it, but must be restored
promptly to the Plan. In exchange for Member or beneficiary status hereunder (or for having any other direct or indirect right or
claim of right from the Plan, or solely as a result of having received an Excess Payment), any party receiving an Excess Payment
grants to the Plan the following nonexclusive rights –
(1)    A constructive trust and first priority equitable lien on any payment that is received directly or
indirectly from the Plan and that is, in whole or part, an Excess Payment (such trust and lien shall be equal to the
amount of the Excess Payment increased by appropriate interest) or upon the proceeds or substitutes for such
payment, and any transfer shall be subject to such constructive trust and equitable lien (including a transfer to a
person, trust fund or entity).
(2)    The right to of fset (as necessary to recover the Excess Payment with appropriate interest)
other payments that are properly payable by the Plan to the recipient of the Excess Payment; however , reliance on
this right is in the discretion of the V ice President, and the existence of an opportunity to apply it shall not
diminish the Plan’ s rights under paragraph (1) above.
(3)    The right to bring any equitable or legal action or proceeding with respect to the enforcement
of any rights in this Section in any court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect, and following receipt of
an Excess Payment the Member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving any and all rights that may
correspond to such party’ s present or future residence.
Any party receiving an Excess Payment shall promptly take all actions requested by the V ice President that are in
furtherance of the Plan’ s recovery of the Excess Payment with appropriate interest. In all cases, this subsection shall
maximize the rights of the Plan to recover improper payments and shall not restrict the rights of the Plan in any way ,
including with respect to any improper payment that is not addressed above.
9.08    Pr ohibited Misconduct.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the V ice President determines that a
Member has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of his termination of
employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization, the Member shall forfeit all Pay Credits and Interest Credits (whether paid
previously , being paid currently or payable in the future), and his PIRP-DC Account shall be adjusted to reflect such
forfeiture and previously paid Pay Credits and Interest Credits
20
shall be recovered. As a condition to Membership in this Plan, each Member agrees to this and each Member agrees to
repay PepsiCo the amounts it seeks to recover under this Section 9.08.
(b) Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly , by a Member shall constitute Prohibited
Misconduct:
(1) The Member accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility , or acquiring any
ownership interest, which involves the Member ’s “Participation” (as defined below) in a business entity that
markets, sells, distributes or produces “Covered Products” (as defined below), unless such business entity makes
retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
(2) The Member , directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Member ’s
recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Or ganization employee to leave the
PepsiCo Or ganization’ s employment or to accept any position with any other entity .
(3) The Member using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo
Organization other than as necessary in his position with the PepsiCo Or ganization. Such confidential information

Organization’ s customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition tar gets; its business operations and
structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and know-
how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.

interests, including violating the Corporation’ s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of
the Corporation or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his employment with the
PepsiCo Or ganization, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
(5) The Member engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud.
21
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Member from
communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the Corporation,
participating in government investigations, and/or receiving any applicable award for providing information to
government authorities. The Corporation nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any
information appropriately protected by the privilege. Further , pursuant to the Defend T rade Secrets Act, an individual
shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret
that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government of ficial, either directly or indirectly , or to an
attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a
complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who
files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the
attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any
document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order .
For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director , officer,
employee, consultant or contractor with respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or
suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or testimonial on behalf of such a business
entity or one or more products it produces. For purposes of this subsection, “Covered Products” shall mean any product

selling or licensing such product anywhere in the world – beverages, including without limitation carbonated soft drinks,
tea, water , juice drinks, sports drinks, cof fee drinks, ener gy drinks, and value-added dairy drinks; juices and juice
products; dairy products; snacks, including salty snacks, sweet snacks meat snacks, granola and cereal bars, and cookies;

dry pasta products; or any product or service that the Member had reason to know was under development by the PepsiCo
Organization during the Member ’s employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
9.09    Notices.
Any notice which under the Plan is required to be given to or served upon the Plan shall be deemed to be suf ficiently
given to or served upon the Plan if it is in writing and delivered to the V ice President. In any case where under the Plan any
notice shall be required to be given to Members, it shall be suf ficient if such notice is delivered to the Member ’s last known
address on file in the records of the Employer or delivered to the Member pursuant to any other method ( e.g., electronically) that
the V ice President determines is reasonably available to the Member .
9.10    Plan Documentation.
Every Member shall on demand be entitled to a copy of the Plan.
9.11    Curr ency of Payment.
Payment of benefits under the Plan shall be made in United States dollars, or other "eligible currency ," as approved by the
Vice President. The amount otherwise payable in United States dollars would be converted to the selected currency using the
exchange rate, based on the methodology approved by the V ice President from time to time.
22
9.12    Governing Law .
The Plan shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New Y ork and any
applicable federal law as would be applied in cases that arise in the United States District Courts that sit in the State of New Y ork.
9.13    Exemption fr om ERISA.
The Plan is intended to be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”),
as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident
aliens of the United States. In order to preserve this exemption from ERISA, Active Membership in the Plan shall be limited to
individuals who are nonresident aliens of the United States and whose assigned work locations are outside the United States, and
it is intended that all permanent records and documentation relating to the administration of the Plan shall be kept at a location
that is outside of the United States.
9.14    Exemption fr om Section 409A.
In order to permit this Plan to be completely exempt from United States Internal Revenue Code section 409A (“Section
409A”), this Plan shall be subject to the special operating rules and limitations in this Section 9.14, ef fective for any period to
which Section 409A applies. It is the intent of the Plan that no Member who is a U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit
from the Plan vest, increase or in any way be enhanced (collectively , a “Benefit Enhancement”) as a result of their compensation
or service while a U.S. Person. However , Interest Credits may be provided on the PIRP-DC Account of a Member who is a U.S.
Person, but only to the extent the balance in the PIRP-DC Account is derived from Pay Credits that relate to Service completed
while the Member was not a U.S. Person (and Interest Credits on such Pay Credits). Accordingly , no Member shall become
entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a calendar year until it is determined, following the close of such year , that the
Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such year . Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the calendar year a
Member ’s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence, the V ice President may authorize a Benefit Enhancement for the
calendar year of benefit commencement to the extent the V ice President determines satisfactorily that the Member will not be a
U.S. Person for such year . In other cases, the Member ’s benefit will commence under this Plan without any Benefit Enhancement
related to the calendar year of commencement, and appropriate adjustments will be made to the Member ’s benefit in the
following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person in such calendar year of commencement. This Section
9.14 shall at all times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the overriding requirement that allocations, benefits and
rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A, and the V ice President shall have such unrestricted
authority as is necessary to ensure that it is applied in accordance with this requirement. Further , to ensure the continuation of
such exemption from Section 409A, the preceding sentence shall be applied and given overriding ef fect notwithstanding any
other provision or language in this Plan.
9.15     Electr onic Signatur es.
The words “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in or related to this Plan or any other document or record to be
signed in connection with or related to this Plan by the Corporation V ice President, Eligible Employee, Dependant, or any other
individual shall be deemed to include electronic signatures and the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be
of the same legal ef fect, validity and enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper -based recordkeeping
system, as the case may be, to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law .

ARTICLE I
Foreword
The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PepsiCo for the
benefit of salaried employees of the PepsiCo Organization who participate in the Salaried Plan. PEP provides
benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP provides benefits for certain eligible employees based
on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula (see, for example, Part B thereof).
1989 Restatement . The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety in 1989.
409A Program Document 2005 Restatement . The Plan was last amended and restated in its entirety
effective as of January 1, 2005. The 2005 restatement sets forth the terms of the Plan that are applicable to benefits
that are subject to Section 409A, i.e., generally , benefits that are earned or vested after December 31, 2004 or
materially modified within the meaning of T reas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4) (the “409A Program”).
Amendments to the 2005 Restatement . The 2005 restatement was amended to reflect the merger into
this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PBG PEP”), ef fective at the end of the day on December 31, 2011.
The PBG PEP document that was in ef fect on April 1, 2009, as amended through January 1, 2011 (the “409A PBG
PEP Document”) is attached hereto as Appendix Article PBG 409A and shall continue to govern PBG PEP benefits
that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger , except for certain administrative
provisions that are now governed by the main portion of the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document as is explained in
Appendix Article PBG 409A. There has been no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to
Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (“Section 409A”)
- 1 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP Documents as a result of the merger or the revisions to the 409A
PepsiCo PEP Document and 409A PBG PEP Document.
2017, 2019, 2021 and 2022 Restatements . This restatement of the 409A Program Document is
effective as of January 1, 2022. Before this restatement, the 409A Program Document was most recently restated
effective as of January 1, 2021, and prior to that, ef fective as of January 1, 2019, and prior to that, ef fective as of
January 1, 2017.
Interplay of this 409A Program and Pre-409A Program . All benefits under the Plan that are not subject
to the 409A Program (i.e., generally , benefits that are earned or vested before January 1, 2005 and not materially
modified thereafter within the meaning of T reas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4)) shall be governed by the Plan Document for
the Pre-Section 409 Program (the “Pre-409A Program”). Together , this document and the document for the Pre-409A
Program describe the terms of a single plan. However , amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and
amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of
the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program
amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to be suf ficient to permit the pre-409A Program to remain
exempt from Section 409A as grandfathered benefits.
Freeze of the Salaried Plan . In general, the Plan provides benefits that make up for benefits that would
accrue under the Salaried Plan but for certain Code limitations on benefits and compensation that apply to the
Salaried Plan. As a result, a Participant’ s accrual of Plan benefits and a Participant’ s growing into certain benefit
enhancements (such as more favorable early commencement factors) are generally tied to the Participant’ s accrual
of benefits and growing into benefit enhancements under the Salaried Plan. For certain
- 2 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Participants, there are special provisions in Section 5.2 (the “PEP Guarantee”) or the Appendix that provide a benefit
accrual opportunity that goes beyond providing a make up for the application of certain Code limitations to the
Salaried Plan. Regardless, however , the freeze on accruals under the Salaried Plan that is ef fective as of the end of
the day on December 31, 2025 also freezes all accruals under this Plan ef fective as of that time. In addition, the
Salaried Plan’ s operational rules with respect to the ability to grow into benefit enhancements after December 31,
2025 govern the ability to grow into benefit enhancements after December 31, 2025 under this Plan.

ARTICLE II
Definitions and Construction
2.1    Definitions : This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases listed below . Where the
following words and phrases, in boldface and underlined, appear in this Plan document (including the Foreword) with
initial capitals they shall have the meaning set forth below , unless a dif ferent meaning is plainly required by the
context.
Accrued Benefit : The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance
with Article V , based on the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Credited Service at the date
of determination.
Actuarial Equivalent : Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to
the Plan with respect to a specific benefit determination, a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of
the factors set forth below . The application of the following assumptions to the computation of benefits payable
under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner . In the event the Plan is amended to provide
new rights, features or benefits, the following actuarial factors shall not apply to these new elements unless
specifically adopted by the amendment.
(1)    Annuities and Inflation Protection : To determine the amount of a Pension payable in
the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or optional form of survivor annuity , as an annuity
with inflation protection, or as a period certain and life annuity , the Plan Administrator shall select the
factors that are to be used. Effective January 1, 2009, the factors selected by the Plan Administrator
are set forth in Schedule 1, below (prior factors appear in the Appendix). Thereafter , the Plan
Administrator shall review
- 4 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
such factors for forms of payment (including for annuities and lump sums) from time to time and shall
amend such factors in its discretion. In general, a Participant shall have no right to have any of the
actuarial factors specified for forms of payment under the Plan from time to time applied to his benefit
(or any portion thereof), except to the extent that a particular factor is currently in ef fect at the time it is
to be applied under the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly intended and binding upon
Participants that any actuarial factors for forms of payment selected by the Plan Administrator from
time-to-time may be applied retroactively to already accrued benefits, and without regard to the
actuarial factors that may have applied previously for such purpose. However , in adjusting benefits
under the Plan using those factors in Schedule 1 (below) that become ef fective for Annuity Starting
Dates on or after January 1, 2019, the right to receive a benefit that is not less than would have applied
under the prior basis for this adjustment shall apply to the same extent (and in the same manner) as
applies under the Salaried Plan with respect to the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors. For this purpose, the
phrase “2019 Salaried Plan Factors” refers to the new factors that appear in the Salaried Plan’ s
definition of “Actuarial Equivalent” ef fective for annuity starting dates (as defined under the Salaried
Plan) on or after January 1, 2019. Effective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2019, if a
Participant elects a survivor , period certain annuity or other death benefit annuity with inflation
protection, Schedule 1(b) shall apply to adjust the Single Life Annuity for the survivor benefit, period
certain or other death benefit, and Schedule 1(c) or (d) shall apply solely to adjust for the
- 5 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
elected inflation protection (for this purpose and as applies generally when determining an Actuarial
Equivalent, the adjustment resulting from applying these factors from separate Schedules shall be
determined using an actuarial computation method that is reasonable and applied consistently to
similarly situated participants).

(2)    Lump Sums : To determine the lump sum value of a Pension, a Pre-Retirement
Spouse’ s Pension under Section 4.6, or a Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension under Section
4.12, the lump sum equivalent factors currently applicable to lump sum distributions under the Salaried
Plan shall apply (disregarding transition factors). These factors are subject to change in accordance
with paragraph (1) above.
(3)    Other Cases : To determine the adjustment to be made in the Pension payable to or
on behalf of a Participant in other cases, the factors are those applicable for such purpose under the
Salaried Plan. In this respect,
- 6 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors shall be ef fective hereunder for Annuity Starting Dates (as defined
under this Plan) on or after January 1, 2019. These factors are subject to change in accordance with
paragraph (1) above.
Annuity : A Pension payable as a series of monthly payments for at least the life of the
Participant.
Annuity Starting Date : The Annuity Starting Date shall be the first day of the first period for
which an amount is payable under this Plan as an annuity or in any other form. A Participant who: (1) is
reemployed after his initial Annuity Starting Date, and (2) is entitled to benefits hereunder after his
reemployment, shall have a subsequent Annuity Starting Date for such benefits only to the extent provided in
Section 6.3(b).
Cashout Limit : The annual dollar limit on elective deferrals under Code section 402(g)(1)(B), as
in effect from time to time.
Code : The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. All references herein
to particular Code Sections shall also refer to any successor provisions and shall include all related
regulations, interpretations and other guidance.
Company : PepsiCo, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of
North Carolina or its successor or successors.
Covered Compensation : “Covered Compensation” as that term is defined in Part B of the
Salaried Plan.
Credited Service : The period of a Participant’ s employment, calculated in accordance with
Section 3.3, which is counted for purposes of determining the amount of benefits payable to, or on behalf of,
the Participant.
- 7 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Disability Retirement Pension : The Retirement Pension available to a Participant under
Section 4.5.
Early 409A Retirement Pension : The 409A Retirement Pension available to a Participant under
Section 4.2.
Elapsed T ime Service : The period of time beginning with a Participant’ s first date of
employment with the PepsiCo Organization and ending with the Participant’ s Final Separation from Service,
irrespective of any breaks in service between those two dates. By way of illustration, if a Participant began
employment with the PepsiCo Organization on January 1, 2000, left the employment of the PepsiCo
Organization from January 1, 2001 until December 31, 2004, and was then reemployed by the PepsiCo
Organization on January 1, 2005 until he had a Final Separation from Service on December 31, 2008, the
Participant would have eight years of Elapsed T ime Service as of his Final Separation from Service.
Eligible Domestic Partner . The definition in this Section 2.1 is ef fective for applicable dates on
and after January 1, 2019, and applies solely to a Participant who is actively employed by , or on an Authorized
Leave of Absence from, a member of the PepsiCo Organization on or after January 1, 2019. For other dates or
Participants, see Appendix Article H.
(1) Definition . For applicable dates on or after January 1, 2019, “Eligible Domestic
Partner” means an individual who is of the same sex or opposite sex as the Participant and who
satisfies paragraph (a), (b) or (c), subject to the additional rules set forth in paragraph (e).
- 8 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(a) Civil Union . If on the applicable date the Participant has entered into a civil
union that is valid on the applicable date in the state in which it was entered into, the Participant’ s

2010, Band IV and above applied in lieu of Leadership Group 6 and above); provided that if this would
result in counting more than 200 individuals as Key Employees as of any such determination date, then
the number treated as Key Employees will be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those
employees otherwise added by this paragraph (3) in order by their base compensation, from the lowest
to the highest.
(4)    Identification of Key Employees Between February 26, 2010 and March 31, 2010 .

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the 12-month periods beginning on the April 1, 2010 ef fective date

least a Band IV or its equivalent on December 31, 2009. For this purpose, an employee shall be
considered to be at least a Band IV or its equivalent as of a date if the employee is classified as
one of the following types of employees in the PepsiCo Organization on that date: (i) a Band IV
employee or above in a PepsiCo Business, (ii) a Level E7 employee or above in a PBG
Business, or (iii) a Salary Grade 19 employee or above at a P AS Business.

regulation for determining the minimum number of a service recipient’ s specified employees. If
the preceding sentence and the methods for identifying Key Employees set forth in subparagraph
(i) or (ii) above, taken together , would result in more than 200 individuals being counted as Key
Employees as of any December 31 determination date, then the number of individuals treated as
Key Employees pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii), who are not described in the first sentence of
this subparagraph (iii), shall be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those
employees otherwise added by such subparagraph in order of their base compensation, from the

division of an employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company

Participant is reemployed after an Annuity Starting Date, he will have a new Final Separation from Service with
respect to any benefits to which he becomes entitled as a result of his reemployment. The following principles
shall generally apply in determining when a Separation from Service occurs:
- 24 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(1)    A Participant separates from service with the Company if the Employee dies, retires,
or otherwise has a termination of employment with the Company . Whether a termination of
employment has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and circumstance indicate that the
Company and the Employee reasonably anticipated that no further services would be performed after a
certain date or that the level of bona fide services the Employee would perform after such date (as an
employee or independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the
average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the
full period in which the Employee provided services to the Company if the Employee has been
providing services for less than 36 months).
(2)    An Employee will not be deemed to have experienced a Separation from Service if
such Employee is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence, to the extent such
leave does not exceed a period of six months or , if longer , such longer period of time during which a
right to re-employment is protected by either statute or contract. If the period of leave exceeds six
months and the individual does not retain a right to re-employment under an applicable statute or by
contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following
such six-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to any
medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be
expected to last for a
- 25 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
continuous period of not less than six months, where such impairment causes the Employee to be
unable to perform the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially similar position of
employment, a 29-month period of absence may be substituted for such six-month period.
(3)    If an Employee provides services both an as employee and as a member of the
Board of Directors of the Company , the services provided as a Director are generally not taken into
account in determining whether the Employee has Separated from Service as an Employee for
purposes of the Plan, in accordance with final regulations under Section 409A.
Service : The period of a Participant’ s employment calculated in accordance with Section 3.2 for
purposes of determining his entitlement to benefits under the Plan.
Single Life Annuity : A level monthly Annuity payable to a Participant for his life only , with no
survivor benefits to his Eligible Spouse or any other person.
Single Lump Sum : The distribution of a Participant’ s total 409A Pension in the form of a single
payment, which payment shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’ s 409A Pension as of the
Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date (or Late Retirement Date, if applicable), but not less than the Actuarial
Equivalent of the Participant’ s 409A Pension as of the Participant’ s Early Retirement Date, in the case of a
Participant who is entitled to an immediate Early 409A Retirement Pension.
Social Security Act : The Social Security Act of the United States, as amended, an enactment
providing governmental benefits in connection with events such as old age, death and disability . Any reference
herein to the Social Security Act (or
- 26 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
any of the benefits provided thereunder) shall be taken as a reference to any comparable governmental
program of another country , as determined by the Plan Administrator , but only to the extent the Plan
Administrator judges the computation of those benefits to be administratively feasible.
Taxable W age Base : The contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the
Social Security Act) in ef fect for the Plan Y ear.
Vested Pension : The Pension available to a Participant under Section 4.3. The term “409A
Vested Pension” shall be used to refer to the portion of a V ested Pension that is derived from the 409A
Program. The term “Pre-409A V ested Pension” shall be used to refer to the portion of a V ested Pension that is
derived from the Pre-409A Program.
2.2    Construction : The terms of the Plan shall be construed in accordance with this section.
(a)    Gender and Number : Unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary , (i) a reference to
one or more genders shall include a reference to all the other genders, and (ii) the singular may include the
plural, and the plural may include the singular .
(b)    Compounds of the W ord “Here” : The words “hereof”, “hereunder” and other similar
compounds of the word “here” shall mean and refer to the entire Plan, not to any particular provision or
section.
(c)    Examples : Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed
by a specific item or items, or there is a passage having a similar ef fect, such passages of the Plan shall be
construed as if the phrase “without
- 27 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limits
on its breadth of application).
(d)    Subdivisions of the Plan Document : This Plan document is divided and subdivided using
the following progression: articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses, and sub-
clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals. Sections are designated by Arabic numerals
containing a decimal point. Subsections are designated by lower-case letters in parentheses. Paragraphs are
designated by Arabic numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower-case roman numerals
in parentheses. Clauses are designated by upper-case letters in parentheses. Sub-clauses are designated by

extend beyond the Participant’ s Separation from Service date because of an authorized leave of absence
related to a Company severance program or agreement, the Plan Administrator may provide for determining

4.11    Forfeiture of Benefits : Effective beginning with benefits accrued after December 31, 2008 (“Post-
2008 Accruals”), and notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the Plan Administrator
determines that a Participant has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of his
or her Separation from Service, the Participant shall forfeit all Post-2008 Accruals (whether paid previously , being

Section 5.6).
(b)    Vested Employees : A Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s 409A Pension shall be payable

Participant has Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension coverage in ef fect for his Eligible Domestic
Partner , any Pension calculated for the Participant under Section 5.2(b) shall be reduced for each year such
coverage is in ef fect by the applicable percentage set forth below (based on the Participant’ s age at the time
the coverage is in ef fect) with a pro rata reduction for any portion of a year . No reduction shall be made for
coverage in ef fect within the 180-day period following a Participant’ s termination of employment.

ARTICLE V
Amount of Retirement Pension
When a 409A Pension becomes payable to or on behalf of a Participant under this Plan, the amount of
such 409A Pension shall be determined under Section 5.1 or 5.3 (whichever is applicable), subject to any
adjustments required under Sections 4.6(b) and 5.4 and subject to the freeze of the Plan described in Article I.
5.1    Participant’ s 409A Pension : Subject to Section 8.7 (Section 457A), a Participant’ s 409A Pension
shall be determined as follows –
(a)    Calculating the 409A Pension : A Participant’ s 409A Pension shall be calculated as follows
(on the basis specified in subsection (b) below and using the definitions appearing in subsection (c) below):
(1)    His T otal Pension, reduced by
(2)    His Salaried Plan Pension, and then further reduced by  (but not below zero)
(3)    His Pre-409A Pension.
(b)    Basis for Determining : The 409A Pension amount in subsection (a) above shall be
determined on a basis that (i) takes into account applicable reductions for early or late commencement as of
the Annuity Starting Date of the 409A Pension, (ii) reflects, if applicable and customary , the relative value of
forms of payment, and (iii) otherwise adjusts the reductions in (a)(2) and (3) above to their Actuarial
Equivalent, in each such respect as appropriate and customary under the circumstances and in accordance
with rules authorized by the Plan Administrator , including to take account the time and form of any prior
payments and to eliminate all duplication of benefits as
- 41 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
determined by the Plan Administrator , and (iii) ef fective for Annuity Starting Dates after December 31, 2018,
allows a Participant’ s 409A Pension to provide a makeup (as appropriate under the circumstances under rules
authorized by the Plan Administrator) for the application of early commencement reduction factors to the
Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension that apply a greater early commencement reduction to such Pre-409A Pension
than would apply under the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors (including with respect to any portion of the
Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension that is derived from the PEP Guarantee).
(c)    Definitions : The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1)    A Participant’ s “Total Pension” means the greater of:
(i)    The amount of the Participant’ s pension determined under the terms of Part B
of the Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and
415 of the Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and
(B) the actuarial adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of Part B of the Salaried Plan (relating to
benefits that are deferred beyond the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date); or
(ii)    The amount (if any) of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under
Section 5.2.
As necessary to ensure the Participant’ s receipt of a “greater of” benefit, the foregoing comparison shall
be made by reflecting, as applicable, the relative value of forms of payment.
- 42 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(2)    A Participant’ s “Salaried Plan Pension” means the amount of the Participant’ s
pension determined under the terms of Part B of the Salaried Plan.
(3)    A Participant’ s “Pre-409A Pension” means the amount of the Participant’ s pension
determined under Section 5.6.
5.2    PEP Guarantee : A Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be entitled to a PEP
Guarantee benefit determined under subsection (b) below . In the case of other Participants, the PEP Guarantee shall
not apply .
(a)    Eligibility : A Participant shall be covered by this section if the Participant has 1988
pensionable earnings from an Employer of at least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable
earnings” means the Participant’ s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year , within the meaning of the Salaried
Plan as in ef fect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include remuneration from an entity
attributable to any period when that entity was not an Employer .
(b)    PEP Guarantee Formula : The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee shall be
determined under the applicable formula in paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).
(1)    Formulas : The amount of a Participant’ s Pension under this paragraph shall be
determined in accordance with subparagraph (i) below . However , if the Participant was actively
employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification eligible for the Salaried Plan prior to July 1,
1975, the amount of his Pension under this paragraph shall be the greater of the amounts
- 43 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
determined under subparagraphs (i) and (ii), provided that subparagraph (ii)(B) shall not apply in
determining the amount of a V ested Pension.
(i)    Formula A : The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be:
(A)    3 percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for the
first 10 years of Credited Service, plus
(B)    1 percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for
each year of Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less
(C)    1-2/3 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount
multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.
In determining the amount of a V ested Pension under this Formula A, the Pension shall first be
calculated on the basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he
remained in the employ of the Employer until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest
Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at his Separation from Service,
and then shall be reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Participant’ s actual years of Credited Service on his Separation from Service and the
denominator of which is the years of Credited Service he would have
- 44 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
earned had he remained in the employ of an Employer until his Normal Retirement Age.
(ii)    Formula B : The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be the greater
of (A) or (B) below:
(A)    1-1/2 percent of Highest A verage Monthly Earnings times the number
of years of Credited Service, less 50 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security
Amount, or
(B)    3 percent of Highest A verage Monthly Earnings times the number of
years of Credited Service up to 15 years, less 50 percent of the Participant’ s Primary
Social Security Amount.
In determining the amount of a Disability Pension under Formula A or B above, the Pension shall be
calculated on the basis of the Participant’ s Credited Service (determined in accordance with
Section 3.3(c)(3) of Part B of the Salaried Plan), and his Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and
Primary Social Security Amount at the date of disability .
(2)    Calculation : The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to
paragraph (1) above, subject to the following special rules:
(i)    Surviving Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Annuity :    Subject to
subparagraph (iii) below and the last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , the Participant’ s Eligible Spouse or Eligible
- 45 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Domestic Partner shall be entitled to receive a survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the
Participant’ s Annuity under this section, with no corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the
Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall
begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’ s death and shall
end with the last monthly payment due prior to the Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic
Partner ’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is more than 10 years
younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable under this subparagraph shall be
adjusted as provided below .
(A)    For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor
benefit payable to such Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by
0.8 percent.
(B)    For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or
Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to
such Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by an additional 0.4
percent.
(ii)    Reductions : The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’ s
PEP Guarantee.
- 46 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(A)    If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment
amount shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit
commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal
Retirement Date.
(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment amount
shall be reduced to the actuarial equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal
Retirement Date (if payment commences before such date), and the Section 4.6(b)
reductions for any Pre Retirement Spouse’ s coverage and Section 4.12(b) reductions for
any Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s coverage shall apply .
(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form
that provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the
life of the surviving Eligible Spouse or surviving Eligible Domestic Partner , that is greater
than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’ s Pension
under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the
Participant’ s behalf is the actuarial equivalent of the Pension otherwise payable under the
foregoing provisions of this section.
(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form
that provides a survivor annuity for a
- 47 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner . In this instance,
the Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the
benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the actuarial equivalent of a Single Life
Annuity for the Participant’ s life.
(E)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in an
Annuity form that includes inflation protection described in Section 6.2(b). In this instance,
the Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the
benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the actuarial equivalent of the elected
Annuity without such protection.
(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion : The amount of the Retirement Pension determined
under this section for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a
lump sum shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under
this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above
and any early retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
For purposes of this paragraph (2), actuarial equivalence shall be determined taking into account the
PEP Guarantee’ s purpose to preserve substantially the value of a benefit under the pre-1989 terms of
the Plan and the 409A Plan’ s design that of fers alternative annuities that are considered actuarial
equivalent
- 48 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
for purposes of Section 409A (taking into account, without limitation, the special rule for subsidized joint
and survivor annuities in T reasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(b)(ii)(C)).
5.3    Amount of Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s 409A Pension : The monthly amount of the Pre-Retirement
Spouse’ s 409A Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse under Section 4.6 shall be determined under
subsection (a) below .
(a)    Calculation : An Eligible Spouse’ s Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s 409A Pension shall be equal to:
(1)    The Eligible Spouse’ s Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension, reduced by
(2)    The Eligible Spouse’ s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension, and then
further reduced by  (but not below zero)
(3)    The Eligible Spouse’ s Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension derived from the Pre-409A
Program.

Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below ,
whichever is applicable, with reference to the PEP Guarantee (if any) that would have been available to the
Participant under 
 
Section 5.2.
(1)    Normal Rule : The Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension payable under this paragraph
shall be equal to the amount that would be payable as a survivor annuity , under a Qualified Joint and
Survivor Annuity , if the Participant had:
(i)    Separated from Service on the date of death (or , if earlier , his actual
Separation from Service);
(ii)    Commenced a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the same date
payments of the Qualified Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension are to commence; and

Section 4.6(a) shall not be less than an amount equal to 25 percent of such Participant’ s PEP

Principles similar to those applicable under – (i) Section 5.1(b), and (ii) the last sentence of Section 5.2(b)(2) shall
apply in determining the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s 409A Pension under this section.
5.4    Certain Adjustments : Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject
to adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan
or a nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored
by a member of the PepsiCo Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals.
(a)    Adjustments for Rehired Participants : This subsection shall apply to a current or former
Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is
recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service. In the event of any such recalculation, the
Participant’ s PEP Pension shall also be recalculated hereunder to the maximum extent permissible under
Section 409A. For this purpose and to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A, the PEP
Guarantee under Section 5.2 is adjusted for in-service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner
as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any
specified plans.
(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans : If the benefit paid under a specified
plan on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether
the increase is by order of a
- 52 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), then the PEP benefit for the
Participant shall be recalculated to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A. If the recalculation
identifies an overpayment hereunder , the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to
recover the overpayment. It is specifically intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this
Plan and any specified plans to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A.
(c)    No Benefit Of fsets That W ould V iolate Section 409A . Effective as of January 1, 2009, if a
Participant has earned a benefit under a plan maintained by a member of the PepsiCo Organization that is a
“qualifying plan” for purposes of the “Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.8 of Part A of the Salaried Plan and the
“Transfers and Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.5 of Part B of the Salaried Plan, such T ransfers and Non-
Duplication rules shall apply when calculating the Participant’ s Total Pension under Section 5.1(c)(1) above
only to the extent the application of such rule to the Participant’ s 409A Pension will not result in a change in
the time or form of payment of such pension that is prohibited by Section 409A. For purposes of the limit on
offsets in the preceding sentence, it is the Company’ s intent to undertake to make special arrangements with
respect to the payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally permissible under the qualifying
plan and compliant with Section 409A, in order to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the
maximum extent possible; to the extent that Section 409A compliant special arrangements are timely put into
effect in a particular situation, the limit on of fsets in the prior sentence will not apply .

5.5    Excludable Employment : An executive who has signed a written agreement with the Company
pursuant to which the individual either (i) waives eligibility under the Plan (even if the individual otherwise meets the
definition of Employee under the Plan), or (ii) agrees not to participate in the Plan, shall not thereafter become entitled
to a benefit or to any increase in benefits in connection with such employment (whichever applies). Written
agreements may be entered into either before or after the executive becomes eligible for or begins participation in the
Plan, and such written agreement may take any form that is deemed ef fective by the Company . This Section 5.5 shall
apply with respect to agreements that are entered into on or after January 1, 2009.
5.6    Pre-409A Pension : A Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension is the portion of the Participant’ s Pension
that is grandfathered under T reasury Regulation § 1.409A-6(a)(3)(i) and (iv). Principles similar to those applicable
under – (i) Section 5.1(b), and (ii) the last sentence of Section 5.2(b)(2) shall apply in determining the Pre-409A
Pension under this section.
5.7    Offsets : Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company may reduce the amount of
any payment or benefit that is or would be payable to or on behalf of a Participant by the amount of any obligation of
the Participant to the Company that is or becomes due and payable, provided that (1) the obligation of the Participant
to the Company was incurred during the employment relationship, (2) the reduction during any Plan Y ear may not
exceed the amount allowed under Code Section 409A and (3) the reduction is made at the same time and in the
same amount as the obligation otherwise would have been due and collectable from the Participant. In addition, in
the event a Participant has earned a 409A Benefit (a “Prior 409A Benefit”) that was paid before, or will become
payable either before or under dif ferent payment terms than, an additional 409A Benefit for the Participant, the
- 54 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
calculation of the Participant’ s additional 409A Benefit shall include an of fset for the Prior 409A Benefit. This of fset

account applicable reductions for early or late commencement as of the Annuity Starting Date of the additional 409A
Pension, (ii) reflects, if applicable and customary , the relative value of forms of payment, and (iii) otherwise adjusts
the of fset to its Actuarial Equivalent, in each such respect as appropriate and customary under the circumstances and
in accordance with rules authorized by the Plan Administrator . Therefore, by way of example, but not by way of
limitation, when pursuant to Section 4.5 a Participant is entitled to Post-Disability Accruals after having become
entitled to Pre-Separation Accruals, such an of fset of the Pre-Separation Accruals will apply in determining the Post-
Disability Accruals.
5.8    Amount of Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension : The monthly amount of the Pre-
Retirement Domestic Partner ’s 409A Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Domestic Partner under Section 4.12

Pension shall be equal to:
(1)    The Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Total Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension,
reduced by

Starting Date, (ii) without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary , and (iii) before receiving 120 payments
under the form of payment, then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to the
Participant’ s estate. If payments have commenced under such form of payment to a Participant’ s primary or
contingent beneficiary and such beneficiary dies before payments are completed, then the remaining
payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to such beneficiary’ s estate.
(b)    Beneficiary Who Is Not an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner : If a Participant’ s
beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , he may not elect:
(1)    The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(i) if his beneficiary is
more than 10 years younger than he is, or
(2)    The 75 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(ii) if his beneficiary is
more than 19 years younger than he is.
6.5    Designation of Beneficiary : A Participant who has elected under Section 6.2 to receive all or part
of his Retirement Pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor
- 68 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
option shall designate a beneficiary who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death. Such designation shall
be made on the election form used to choose such optional form of payment or an approved election form filed under
the Salaried Plan, whichever is applicable. In the case of the survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), the
Participant shall be entitled to name both a primary beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary . A Participant (whether
active or former) shall have the right to change or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to his Annuity
Starting Date. The designation of any beneficiary , and any change or revocation thereof, shall be made in accordance
with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator . A beneficiary designation shall not be ef fective unless and until filed
with the Plan Administrator . If no beneficiary is properly designated and a Participant’ s elects a survivor ’s option
described in Section 6.2(a)(2), the Participant’ s beneficiary shall be his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner ,
as applicable. A Participant entitled to a V ested Pension does not have the right or ability to name a beneficiary; if the
Participant is permitted under Section 6.2 to elect an optional form of payment, then his beneficiary shall be his
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as applicable, on his Annuity Starting Date.
6.6    Required Delay for Key Employees : Notwithstanding Section 6.1 above, if a Participant is
classified as a Key Employee upon his Separation from Service (or at such other time for determining Key Employee
status as may apply under Section 409A), then distributions to the Participant shall commence as follows:
(a)    Distribution of a Retirement Pension : In the case of a Key Employee Participant who is
entitled to a 409A Retirement Pension, distributions shall commence on the earliest first of the month that is at
least six months after the date the Participant Separates from Service (or , if earlier , the Participant’ s death).
For periods
- 69 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
before 2009, commencement of distributions, however , shall not be delayed under the preceding sentence if
the Participant’ s 409A Retirement Pension commences at the same time as his pension under the Salaried
Plan in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(3)(i).
(b)    Distribution of a V ested Pension . In the case of a Participant who is entitled to a 409A
Vested Pension, distributions shall commence as provided in Section 6.1(b), or if later , on the earliest first of
the month that is at least six months after the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or , if earlier , the
Participant’ s death). For periods before 2009, commencement of distributions, however , shall not be delayed
under the preceding sentence if the Participant’ s 409A V ested Pension commences at the same time as his
pension under the Salaried Plan in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(3)(i).
(c)    Interest Paid for Delay . Any payments to the Participant that are delayed in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 6.6 shall be increased for earnings at the interest rate used to compute the
Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value through the date the check for payment is prepared, with such delayed
payment and accumulated interest paid as a lump sum payment to the Participant on the date payment occurs
in accordance with subsection (a) or (b) above, whichever is applicable. If a Participant’ s beneficiary or estate
is paid under subsection (a) or (b) above as a result of his death, then any payments that would have been
made to the Participant and that were delayed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.6 shall be
paid as otherwise provided in the Plan, with interest at the rate specified in the preceding sentence through the
date the check for payment is prepared.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
6.7    Payment of FICA and Related Income T axes : As provided in subsections (a) through (c) below , a
portion of a Participant’ s 409A Pension shall be paid as a single lump sum and remitted directly to the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) in satisfaction of the Participant’ s FICA Amount and the related withholding of income tax at
source on wages (imposed under Code Section 3401 or the corresponding withholding provisions of the applicable
state, local or foreign tax laws as a result of the payment of the FICA Amount) and the additional withholding of
income tax at source on wages that is attributable to the pyramiding of wages and taxes.
(a)    Timing of Payment:  As of the date that the Participant’ s FICA Amount and related income
tax withholding are due to be deposited with the IRS, a lump sum payment equal to the Participant’ s FICA
Amount and any related income tax withholding shall be paid from the Participant’ s 409A Pension and remitted
to the IRS (or other applicable tax authority) in satisfaction of such FICA Amount and income tax withholding
related to such FICA Amount. The classification of a Participant as a Key Employee (as defined in Section 2.1)
shall have no ef fect on the timing of the lump sum payment under this subsection (a).
(b)    Reduction of 409A Pension . To reflect the payment of a Participant’ s FICA Amount and any
related income tax liability , the Participant’ s 409A Pension shall be reduced, ef fective as of the date for
payment of the lump sum in accordance with subsection (a) above, with such reduction being the Actuarial
Equivalent of the lump sum payment used to satisfy the Participant’ s FICA Amount and related income tax
withholding. It is expressly contemplated that this reduction may
- 71 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
occur ef fective as of a date that is after the date payment of a Participant’ s 409A Pension commences.
(A)    No Ef fect on Commencement of 409A Pension . The Participant’ s 409A Pension shall
commence in accordance with the terms of this Plan. The lump sum payment to satisfy the Participant’ s
FICA Amount and related income tax withholding shall not af fect the time of payment of the Participant’ s
actuarially reduced 409A Pension, including not af fecting any required delay in payment to a Participant
who is classified as a Key Employee.

ARTICLE VII
Administration
7.1    Authority to Administer Plan : The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator , which shall have
the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as it deems appropriate. The Plan Administrator shall
maintain Plan records and make benefit calculations, and may rely upon information furnished it by the Participant in
writing, including the Participant’ s current mailing address, age and marital status. The Plan Administrator ’s
interpretations, determinations, regulations and calculations shall be final and binding on all persons and parties
concerned. Neither the Company nor the Plan Administrator shall be a fiduciary of the Plan, and any restrictions that
might apply to a party in interest under section 406 of ERISA shall not apply under the Plan, including with respect to
the Company or the Plan Administrator .
7.2    Facility of Payment : Whenever , in the Plan Administrator ’s opinion, a person entitled to receive
any payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so
as to be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the Plan Administrator may make payments to such person or to the
legal representative of such person for his benefit, or the Plan Administrator may apply the payment for the benefit of
such person in such manner as it considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance
with the provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under
the provisions of the Plan.
7.3    Claims Procedure : The Plan Administrator , or a party designated by the Plan Administrator , shall
have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret
- 73 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits. As a result,
benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the Participant (or other
applicant) is entitled to them. Any decisions or determinations hereunder shall be made in the absolute and
unrestricted discretion of the Plan Administrator , even if (i) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan
provisions in question, or (ii) a decision or determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question,
and even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or expressly call for a decision or determination. All
decisions and determinations made by the Plan Administrator will be final, conclusive, and binding on all parties. The
Plan Administrator may consider the intent of the Company with respect to a Plan provision in making any
determination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the provisions set forth in any document that arguably do
not contemplate considering such intent. The Plan Administrator ’s discretion is absolute, and in any case where the
breadth of the Plan Administrator ’s discretion is at issue, it is expressly intended that the Plan Administrator (or its
delegate) be accorded the maximum possible discretion. Any exercise by the Plan Administrator of its discretionary
authority shall be reviewed by a court under the arbitrary and capricious standard (i.e., abuse of discretion). If,
pursuant to this discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Participant or
beneficiary (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator , or a party designated by the Plan
Administrator , will provide such claimant the claims review process described in this Section. The Plan Administrator
has the discretionary right to modify the claims process described in this Section in any manner so long as the claims
review process, as modified, includes the steps described below . A claim shall be made in writing or in such other
form as is acceptable to the Plan Administrator . Within a 90-day response period
- 74 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
following the receipt of the claim by the Plan Administrator , the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant of:
(a)    The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
(b)    Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(c)    A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit
to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
(d)    A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to
such process and a statement of the claimant’ s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following a further
denial on review).
If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim
it may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant
before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date
by which the Plan Committee expects to make the final decision. The claim review procedure is available upon
written request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator , or the designated party , within 60 days after receipt by the
claimant of written notice of the denial of the claim. Upon review , the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a
full and fair review of the claim, including the opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments, document,
records and other information relevant to the claim, and the Plan Administrator ’s review shall take into account such
comments, documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial
determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days
- 75 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
after receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional
60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day
period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan Administrator
expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be
understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with references to the specific Plan provisions
on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request ad free of charge,
reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his or her claim for
benefits. Any special extension, which is required by ERISA and applies to one or more deadlines applicable under
this claims procedure, shall apply under this Plan to the same extent that special extension applies under the Salaried
Plan.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed
solely on the basis of the record before the Plan Administrator at the time it made its determination. In addition, any
such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this section as is more fully
explained in Section 7.5. Any notice or other notification that is required to be sent to a claimant under this section
may be sent pursuant to any method approved under Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1 or other
applicable guidance.
7.4    Effect of Specific References : Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator ’s discretion
shall create no inference that the Plan Administrator ’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other
provision, is less complete or broad.
- 76 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
7.5    Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’ s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court     : Before filing any
Claim (including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the
Claimant’ s rights under the claims procedures of Section 7.3.
(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 is
intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps
necessary to clarify or ef fect this intent may be taken). For example, exhaustion may not be excused (i) for
failure to respond to a Claim unless the purported claimant took suf ficient steps to make it reasonably clear to
the Plan Administrator that the purported claimant was submitting a Claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for
failure to fulfill a request for documents unless (A) ERISA requires the documents to be provided in response
to the request, (B) the Claimant requests such documents in a writing that is addressed to and actually
received by the Plan Administrator , (C) the Plan Administrator fails to provide the requested documents within
6 months after the date the request is received, or within such longer period as may be reasonable under the
facts and circumstances, and (D) the requestor took suf ficient steps to make it reasonably clear to the Plan
Administrator that the requestor was asserting an ERISA right to the documents. Accordingly , but without
limitation, a purported claimant or requestor who was not treated as a Participant shall not be deemed to have
taken suf ficient steps for purposes of the prior sentence unless he makes it reasonably clear to the Plan
Administrator that he is claiming to have been entitled to be a Participant.
- 77 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(b)    In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion
of the Plan’ s claims procedure as described in this Section 7.5, the subsequent action or consideration shall be
limited, to the maximum extent permissible, to the record that was before Plan Administrator in the claims
procedure.
(c)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other
Disputes that are not Claims (including those that a court might consider at the same time) are of greater
significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Plan Administrator may choose to provide in connection with
novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential and (iv)
even if the Plan Administrator has not previously defined or established specific claims procedures that directly
apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the Plan Administrator (upon notice of
the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act by analogy to) the
claims procedures of Section 7.3 that apply to claims for benefits).
(d)    The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class
basis or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be
made as are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.
(e)     For example, exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a claim unless the
purported Claimant took steps that were suf ficient to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that
the purported Claimant was submitting a claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for
documents unless (A) the Claimant is lawfully entitled to receive a copy of the requested
- 78 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
document from the Plan Administrator at the time and in the form requested, (B) the Claimant requests such
documents in a writing that is addressed to and actually received by the Plan Administrator , (C) the Plan
Administrator fails to provide the requested documents within 6 months after the date the request is received,
or within such longer period as may be reasonable under the facts and circumstances, (D) the Claimant took
steps that were suf ficient to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that the requestor was actually
entitled to receive the requested documents at the time and in the form requested (i.e., generally the Claimant
must provide suf ficient information to place the Plan Administrator on notice of a colorable claim for benefits),
and (E) the documents requested and not provided are material to the determination of one or more colorable
claims of which the Claimant has informed the Plan Administrator .
(f)    For purposes of this Section 7.5, the following definitions apply .
(i)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, assertion, action or other matter .
(ii)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of
the following –
(A)    The interpretation of the Plan
(B)    The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan
(C)    The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light
of applicable law;
- 79 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(D)    Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been
validly adopted or put into ef fect;
(E)    The administration of the Plan;
(F)    Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms,
conditions or requirements of ERISA or other applicable law or regulation, regardless of
whether such terms, conditions or requirements are, in whole or in part, incorporated into
the terms, conditions or requirements of the Plan;
(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;
(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any fiduciary
duty; or
(I)    Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the Plan
Administrator , or (ii) relates to the Plan in any way .
It is the Plan Administrator ’s intent to interpret and operate the Plan in good faith and at all times
consistently with ERISA. Therefore, as a condition for any right or recovery related to the Plan,
the Plan imposes a contractual obligation for complete exhaustion under this Section with
respect to any Claim (as defined above) in order to allow for the ef ficient and uniform resolution
of such Claims and to protect the Plan from potentially substantial and unnecessary litigation
expenses that exhaustion could obviate.
- 80 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(iii)    A “Claimant” is any actual or putative Employee, former Employee,
Participant, former Participant, beneficiary (or the spouse, former spouse, domestic partner ,
estate, heir or representative of any of the foregoing individuals), or any other individual, person,
entity with a relationship to any of the foregoing individuals or the Plan, as well as any group of
one or more of the foregoing, who has a Claim.
7.6    Limitations on Actions : Any claim filed under section 7.3 and any action filed in state or federal
court by or on behalf of a former or current Employee, Participant, beneficiary or any other individual, person or entity
(collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits or for the alleged interference with or
violation of ERISA-protected rights must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first
accrues.
(a) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under
the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than the earliest of (i) when the Petitioner has received the
calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action, (ii) the date identified to the
Petitioner by the Plan Administrator on which payments shall commence, (iii) when the Petitioner has actual or
constructive knowledge of the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are the basis of his claim, or (iv)
the date when the benefit was first paid, provided, or denied.
(b) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to the alleged interference
with ERISA-protected rights shall be deemed to accrue when the claimant has actual or constructive
knowledge of the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are alleged to constitute interference with
ERISA-protected rights.
- 81 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(c) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to any other claim, action or
suit not covered by subsection (a) or (b) above must be brought within two years of the date when the claimant
has actual or constructive knowledge of the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are alleged to give
rise to the claim, action or suit.
Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any
representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or other communications
pursuant to or following the mandatory appeals process described in Section 7.3 shall have no ef fect on this two-year
time frame.
7.7    Restriction on V enue : Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the
Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner (as defined in Section 7.6 above) shall only be brought or filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New Y ork, ef fective for claims or actions filed on or after January 1,
2011.

ARTICLE VIII
Miscellaneous
8.1    Nonguarantee of Employment : Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of
employment between an Employer and any Employee, or as a right of any Employee to be continued in the
employment of an Employer , or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its Employees, with or
without cause.
8.2    Nonalienation of Benefits : Benefits payable under the Plan or the right to receive future benefits
under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer , assignment, pledge,
encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution, or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary , and any attempt to
anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer , assign, pledge, encumber , charge or otherwise dispose of any right to benefits
payable hereunder , including any assignment or alienation in connection with a divorce, separation, child support or
similar arrangement, shall be null and void and not binding on the Company . The Company shall not in any manner
be liable for , or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits
hereunder .
8.3    Unfunded Plan : The Company’ s obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall
constitute liabilities by the Company payable when due out of the Company’ s general funds. To the extent the
Participant or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than
the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Company .
8.4    Action by the Company : Any action by the Company under this Plan may be made by the Board of
Directors of the Company or by the Compensation Committee of the
- 83 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Board of Directors, with a report of any actions taken by it to the Board of Directors. In addition, such action may be
made by any other person or persons duly authorized by resolution of said Board to take such action.
8.5    Indemnification : Unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine otherwise, the
Company shall indemnify , to the full extent permitted by law , any employee acting in good faith within the scope of his
employment in carrying out the administration of the Plan.
8.6    Compliance with Section 409A :
(a)    General : It is the intention of the Company that the Plan shall be construed in accordance
with the applicable requirements of Section 409A. Further , in the event that the Plan shall be deemed not to
comply with Section 409A, then neither the Company , the Board of Directors, the Plan Administrator nor its or
their designees or agents shall be liable to any Participant or other person for actions, decisions or
determinations made in good faith.
(b)    Non-duplication of benefits : In the interest of clarity , and to determine benefits in compliance
with the requirements of Section 409A, provisions have been included in this 409A Document describing the
calculation of benefits under certain specific circumstances, for example, provisions relating to the inclusion of
salary continuation during certain window severance programs in the calculation of Highest A verage Monthly
Earnings, as specified in Appendix B. Notwithstanding this or any similar provision, no duplication of benefits
may at any time occur under the Plan. Therefore, to the extent that a specific provision of the Plan provides for
recognizing a benefit determining element (such as pensionable earnings or service) and this same
- 84 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
element is or could be recognized in some other way under the Plan, the specific provision of the Plan shall
govern and there shall be absolutely no duplicate recognition of such element under any other provision of the
Plan, or pursuant to the Plan’ s integration with the Salaried Plan. This provision shall govern over any contrary
provision of the Plan that might be interpreted to support duplication of benefits.
8.7    Section 457A : To avoid the application of Code section 457A (“Section 457A”) to a Participant’ s
Pension, the following shall apply to a Participant who transfers to a work location outside of the United States to
provide services to a member of the PepsiCo Organization that is neither a United States corporation nor a pass-
through entity that is wholly owned by a United States corporation (“Covered T ransfer”):
(a)    The Participant shall automatically vest in his or her Pension as of the last business day
before the Covered T ransfer;
(b)    From and after the Covered T ransfer , any benefit accruals or other increases or
enhancements to the Participant’ s Pension relating to –
(1)    Service, or
(2)    The attainment of a specified age while in the employment of the PepsiCo
Organization (“age attainment”),
(collectively , “Benefit Enhancement”) will not be credited to the Participant until the last day of the Plan Y ear in
which the Participant renders the Service or has the age attainment that results in such Benefit Enhancement,
and then only to the extent permissible under subsection (c) below at that time; and
(c)    The Participant shall have no legal right to (and the Participant shall not receive) any Benefit
Enhancement that relates to Service or age attainment
- 85 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
from and after the Covered T ransfer to the extent such Benefit Enhancement would constitute compensation
that is includable in income under Section 457A.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsection (a) above shall not apply to a Participant who has a Covered T ransfer if,
prior to the Covered T ransfer , the Company provides a written communication (either to the Participant individually , to
a group of similar Participants, to Participants generally , or in any other way that causes the communication to apply
to the Participant – i.e., an “applicable communication”) that these subsections do not apply to the Covered T ransfer
in question. Subsection (b) shall cease to apply as of the earlier of – (i) the date the Participant returns to service for a
member of the PepsiCo Organization that is a United States corporation or a pass-through entity that is wholly owned
by a United States corporation, or (ii) the ef fective date for such cessation that is stated in an applicable
communication.
8.8    Authorized T ransfers : If a Participant transfers to an entity that is not part of the PepsiCo
Organization, the liability for any benefits accrued while the Participant was employed by the PepsiCo Organization
shall remain with the Company , except as otherwise expressly provided by an agreement between the Company and
the Participant’ s new employer .
8.9     Electronic Signatures : The words “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in or related to
this Plan or any other document or record to be signed in connection with or related to this Plan by the Company ,
Plan Administrator , Employee or other individual shall be deemed to include electronic signatures and the keeping of
records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal ef fect, validity and enforceability as a manually
- 86 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the fullest extent
permissible under applicable law .

time provided, however , that no such amendment or termination shall adversely af fect the amount of benefit to which
a Participant or his beneficiary is entitled under Article IV on the date of such amendment or termination, unless the
Participant becomes entitled to an amount equal to such benefit under another plan or practice adopted by the
Company (except as necessary to comply with Section 409A). Specific forms of payment are not protected under the
preceding sentence.
9.2    Amendments : The Company may , in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to

Employees who experience a change in control in accordance with T reasury Regulation §1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), or (iii)
as otherwise permitted under Code Section 409A. If the Plan is terminated with respect to fewer than all of the
Employers, the Plan shall continue in ef fect for the benefit of the Employees of the remaining Employers. Upon
termination, the distribution of Participants’ 409A Pensions shall be subject to restrictions applicable under Section
409A.
9.4    Change in Control : The Company intends to have the maximum discretionary authority to
terminate the Plan and make distributions in connection with a Change in Control (defined as provided in Section

Control as is permissible under Section 409A. The previous sentence contains the exclusive terms under which a
distribution shall be made in connection with any Change in Control in the case of benefits that are derived from this

three separate plans within the meaning of ERISA, as are set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c). This division into
separate plans became ef fective as of July 1, 1996; previously the plans set forth in subsections (b) and (c) were a
single plan within the meaning of ERISA.
(a)    Excess Benefit Plan : An excess benefit plan within the meaning of section 3(36) of ERISA,
maintained solely for the purpose of providing benefits for Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations
on benefits imposed by section 415 of the Code.
(b)    Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan : A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the
purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees within the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. The plan provides benefits for
Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations imposed by section 401(a)(17) of the Code on benefits
under the Salaried Plan (after taking into account any benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan). For ERISA
reporting purposes, this portion of PEP may be referred to as the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan I.
(c)    Preservation T op Hat Plan : A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the purpose of
providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within
the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. The plan provides preserves benefits for those

participants described in section 5.2(a) hereof, by preserving for them the pre-1989 level of benefit accrual that
was in ef fect before the Salaried Plan’ s amendment ef fective January 1, 1989 (after taking into account any
benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan and Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan). For ERISA reporting
purposes, this portion of PEP shall be referred to as the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan II.
Benefits under this Plan shall be allocated first to the Excess Benefit Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the
purpose indicated in (a) above; then any remaining benefits shall be allocated to the Excess Compensation T op Hat
Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the purpose indicated in (b) above; then any remaining benefits shall be
allocated to the Preservation T op Hat Plan. These three plans are severable for any and all purposes as directed by
the Company .
In addition to the above, to the extent that lump sum termination benefits are paid under this Plan in
connection with a severed employee’ s Special Early Retirement (as defined in Appendix Article D) under a temporary
severance program sponsored by the Company , this portion of the Plan shall be a component of the Company’ s
unfunded severance plan that includes the temporary program of severance benefits in question. As a component of
a severance plan, the lump sum termination benefits are welfare benefits, and this portion is part of a “welfare benefit
plan” under ERISA section 3(1). This severance plan component shall exist solely (i) for the duration of the temporary
severance program in question, and (ii) for the purpose of paying severance benefits. As a portion of an ERISA
welfare plan, any such temporary severance benefits hereunder shall not be subject to the reporting requirements for
top hat plans under ERISA or any of the ERISA requirements for pension plans.

Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Pension, even if the period of time counted as
Credited Service under the Severance Program occurs after a Participant’ s Separation from Service.
B.4    Inclusion of Service :

of an International T ransfer Participant shall be determined under Section C.3 below , subject to Section C.6 below .
The benefit of a PIRP T ransfer Participant shall be determined under Section C.5 below . Once a benefit is determined

this Article are subject to Code section 409A, including any accrued prior to January 1, 2005. The provisions of this
Article relating to International T ransfer Participants are ef fective April 1, 2007. The provisions of this Article relating
to PIRP T ransfer Participants are ef fective January 1, 2016 (but they may take into account years that precede
January 1, 2016).
C.2    International T ransfer Participants :
An “International T ransfer Participant” is a Participant who is:
(a)    General Rule : An individual who, following a transfer to an April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary (as
defined in paragraph (5) of the Employer definition in Section 2.1 of Part B of the Salaried Plan, as in ef fect on
January 1, 2014)), would qualify as an Employee within the meaning of paragraph (2)(vi) of the Employee
definition in Section 2.1 of Part B of the Salaried Plan, as in ef fect on January 1, 2014 (U.S. citizen or resident
alien on qualifying temporary international assignment) but for the fact that his
- 113 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
assignment with the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary is in a position of employment that is classified as Band 4
(or its equivalent) or higher; or
(b)    Special Rule for Certain Permanent Assignments to Mexico : Notwithstanding subsection (a)
above, an International T ransfer Participant also includes an individual who was transferred to an April 2007
Foreign Subsidiary based in Mexico, and who would qualify as an Employee within the meaning of paragraph
(2)(vi) of the Employee definition in Section 2.1 of Part B of the Salaried Plan, as in ef fect on January 1, 2014
(U.S. citizen or resident alien on qualifying temporary international assignment) but for the fact that:
(1)    His assignment with the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary is in a position that is classified as
Band 4 (or its equivalent) or higher;
(2)    Mexico is his home country on the records of the Expat Centre for Excellence group or its
successor (in accordance with such paragraph (2)(vi)); and
(3)    The duration of his assignment with the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary in Mexico is not
limited to 5 years or less.
An individual described in subsection (a) or (b) above may still qualify as an International T ransfer Participant if
his transfer to an April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary occurred prior to April 1, 2007 (the ef fective date of this
Article), provided he satisfied the terms of subsection (a) or (b) above on the date of his transfer .
C.3    Benefit Formula for International T ransfer Participants :
Except as provided in this Section C.3, an International T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under the Plan shall be
determined using a calculation methodology that is substantially similar to that which applies under Section 5.1 of the
Plan.
- 114 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(a)    Total Pension for International T ransfer Participant : Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an
International T ransfer Participant’ s “Total Pension” (as defined in Section 5.1(c)(1) of the Plan) shall be
calculated as if he continued to receive Credited Service and Earnings under the Salaried Plan while working
for the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary to which he transferred following his employment with an Employer
based in the United States, without regard to the actual date on which he ceased receiving Credited Service
and Earnings under the Salaried Plan. However , the T otal Pension of an International T ransfer Participant
whose transfer to an April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary occurred prior to 1992 shall not take into account Credited
Service and Earnings for employment with the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary prior to 1992.
(b)    Calculation of International T ransfer Participant’ s Benefit : The International T ransfer Participant’ s
benefit under the Plan shall be calculated by reducing his T otal Pension as determined under subsection (a)
above (expressed as a lump sum as of his benefit commencement date under the Plan) by the following
amounts:
(1)    The amount of his actual benefit under the Salaried Plan (expressed as a lump sum amount
on his benefit commencement date), and
(2)    Any amounts paid to him from a “qualifying plan” as that term is defined under Section
3.5(c)(4) of Part B of the Salaried Plan (T ransfers and Non-Duplication) with respect to his assignment
with the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary (with such amounts expressed as a lump sum on his benefit
commencement date under this Plan).

C.5    Benefit Formula for PIRP T ransfer Participants :
Except as provided in this Section C.5, a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under the Plan shall be
determined using a calculation methodology that is substantially similar to that which applies under Section 5.1 of the
Plan.
(a)    Total Pension for PIRP T ransfer Participant : Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a PIRP
Transfer Participant’ s “Total Pension” (as defined in Section 5.1(c)(1) of the Plan) shall be calculated as
provided in paragraphs (1) and (2) below .
(1)    First, a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Total Pension shall be calculated as if he were an
eligible employee under the Salaried Plan for the entire Y ear of T ransfer , and as if he received Credited
Service and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Y ear of T ransfer equal to – (i) his actual Credited
Service and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Y ear of T ransfer , increased by  (ii) any other
compensation and service for the Y ear of T ransfer that would have been recognized as PIRP-DB Salary
and PIRP DB Pensionable Service, if Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB did not apply for the Y ear of T ransfer .
(2)    If (during a year a PIRP T ransfer Participant is otherwise accruing benefits under this Plan)
the PIRP T ransfer Participant would be credited with PIRP-DB Salary that cannot be recognized under
PIRP as a result of Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB, and if this PIRP-DB Salary would be considered for
accrual purposes under PIRP-DB in connection with PIRP-DB Pensionable Service that is not
recognized under this Plan, the increase in the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s
- 118 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Accrued Benefit under PIRP that is related to this PIRP-DB Pensionable Service and that is blocked by
Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB shall be added to the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Accrued Benefit under this
Plan. In the case of a PIRP T ransfer Participant who has a Separation from Service on or after January
1, 2017, this increase in the PIRP T ransfers Participant’ s Accrued Benefit under this Plan shall result in
an appropriate increase, determined in the Company’ s discretion, in the T otal Pension determined
under paragraph (1) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining Credited Service and
Earnings under this subsection (a), no compensation or service shall be taken into account more than
once, and a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Total Pension shall be determined in a way that avoids any
duplication of benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP T ransfer Participant under PIRP-
DB (after applying Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or contributed to by the
Company or an af filiate, but without applying any of fset that would violate Code Section 409A.
(b)    Calculation of PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Benefit : The PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under
the Plan shall be calculated by reducing his T otal Pension as determined under subsection (a) above by the
reductions that are normally applicable under Article V . In addition, in the case of a PIRP T ransfer Participant
who has a Separation from Service on or after January 1, 2017, if (during a year a PIRP T ransfer Participant is
otherwise accruing benefits under this Plan) the value of the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under PIRP-
DB would increase (if Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB did not apply) as a result of the PIRP T ransfer Participant
becoming eligible for early retirement
- 119 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
under PIRP-DB, then the projected increase in value of the PIRP-DB benefit at the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s
retirement under PIRP-DB, which will be blocked by Section 9.14 of PIRP , shall result in an appropriate
increase, determined in the Company’ s discretion, in the Participant’ s benefit under this Plan that is payable at
the time and in the form applicable under this Plan. The appropriate increase shall be determined net of any
expected increase in the value of the benefit under this Plan related to becoming eligible for Early Retirement
under this Plan. In addition, a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s appropriate increase shall be determined in a way
that avoids any duplication of benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP T ransfer Participant
under PIRP-DB (after applying Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or contributed to by the
Company or an af filiate, but without applying any of fset that would violate Code Section 409A.
C.6    Alternative Arrangements Permitted :
Notwithstanding any provision of this Article or the Plan to the contrary , the Company and a Participant who
would qualify as an International T ransfer Participant under Section C.2 above may agree in writing to disregard the
provisions of this Article in favor of another mutually agreed upon benefit arrangement under the Plan that complies
with Code Section 409A, in which case this Article shall not apply .

that such individual is reemployed by the Company on or after May 1, 2009, into a position that is classified as Band
4 (or its equivalent) or higher . For purposes of determining such Participant’ s Total Pension within the meaning of
Section 5.1(c)(1), but not for purposes of determining such Participant’ s Salaried Plan Pension within the meaning of
Section 5.1(c)(2), such Participant’ s position on reemployment will be deemed to be classified as below Band 4 (or its
equivalent), so that the Participant’ s transfer is eligible to be treated as an Eligible T ransfer (subject to the other
conditions thereof) and the Participant is eligible for the imputed service provisions of Section TRI.4(b) and (c). Such
Participant’ s benefit otherwise shall be subject to the Plan’ s usual conditions and shall be paid in accordance with the
Plan’ s usual terms. All benefits paid under this Article are subject to Code section 409A.

APPENDIX ARTICLE F - 
U.K. Supplementary Appendix Participants with U.S. Service     
F.1    Scope:
This Article applies to “Covered U.K. Employees” as defined in Section F .2 below . The benefit of a Covered
U.K. Employee shall be determined as provided in Section F .3 below . Once a benefit is determined for a Covered
U.K. Employee under this Article, it shall be paid in accordance with the Plan’ s normal terms regarding the time and
form of payment. All benefits payable under this Article are subject to Code section 409A. This Article has been
restated ef fective January 1, 2016 (the original version of this Article was ef fective January 1, 2011, and it applied, in
accordance with its prior terms, to periods of service before January 1, 2016).
F.2    “Covered U.K. Employee” Defined :
A “Covered U.K. Employee” is a participant in the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (“U.K. Participant”) who – (i)
becomes subject to United States income taxes, e.g., by transferring to a position with the Company in the United
States or otherwise (hereinafter referenced as “Engages in U.S. Service”), (ii) continues to accrue benefits under the
PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan after he Engages in U.S. Service, (iii) would have also accrued a benefit under the U.K.
Supplementary Pension Appendix for such period following when he Engages in U.S. Service (except for the
unavailability of accruals under such Appendix for the period a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service), (iv)
subsequently either – (A) is localized in the United States as an employee of the PepsiCo Organization, or (B)
terminates employment with the PepsiCo Organization (provided this occurs before the date the U.K. Participant
commences an assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States, as defined in the
Code), and (v) only after fully satisfying all of the preceding clauses, is then designated by
- 128 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
the Company (in its completely unfettered discretion) as a Covered U.K. Employee and thereby granted a legally
binding right to a benefit under this Article F at the time of the designation. The period that a U.K. Participant Engages
in U.S. Service shall begin on the first day that he becomes subject to United States income taxes (his “U.S.
Commencement Date”), and it shall end on the date he is no longer subject to U.S. income taxes or , if earlier , the
date his Plan benefits under this Article F commence (his “U.S. Cessation Date”).
F.3    Benefit for Covered U.K. Employees :
A Covered U.K. Employee’ s benefit under the Plan shall be determined by calculating, as of his Modified U.S.
Cessation Date, his “T otal U.K. Supplementary Benefit” and then subtracting from this amount his “Frozen U.K.
Supplementary Benefit.” For this purpose, a Covered U.K. Employee’ s—
(a)    “Modified U.S. Cessation Date” is the earliest of the following – (i) the date he is no longer subject
to U.S. income taxes, (ii) the date he first satisfies clause (iv) of Section F .2, (iii) the date he commences an
assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States (as defined in the Code),
or (iv) the date his Plan benefits under this Article F commence.
(b)    “T otal U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he would have under the terms
of the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix, calculated based on all service and compensation with the
Company through his Modified U.S. Cessation Date that is counted in the calculation of his benefit under the
PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (or that would be counted but for a limitation applicable to the plan under U.K.
law), and with such total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date his
benefits under this Article F commence, and
- 129 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(c)    “Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he had under the terms of the
U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date, and with such
total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date his benefits under this
Article F commence.
The calculation provided for in the preceding sentence shall be made in accordance with the operating rules set forth
in Section F .4 below .
F.4    Operating Rules:
The following operating rules apply to the calculation in Section F .3. above.
(a)    In general, accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K.
Employee’ s U.S. Cessation Date shall not reduce the benefit under this Article F determined under Section
F.3. Notwithstanding the prior sentence and anything in Section F .3 to the contrary , to the extent a Covered
U.K. Employee’ s accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K.
Employee’ s U.S. Cessation Date have more than fully of fset the Covered U.K. Employee’ s accruals under the
U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix (and the excess would have been of fset against the benefit under this
Article F had such benefit accrued under the U.K. Supplementary Appendix), then any such excess as of the
date benefits under this Article F commence (expressed as a lump sum as of such date) shall be of fset against
the benefits under this Article F to the extent such of fset would not violate Code Section 409A.
(b)    In determining the value of a lump sum under this Article F , the actuarial assumptions that are
used shall be actuarial assumptions that comply with Section
- 130 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
417(e) of the Code and, specifically , are the Code Section 417(e) assumptions that would be used under the
Salaried Plan to pay a retirement lump sum as of the date applicable that the lump sum in question is to be
determined under this Article F .
(c)    A Covered U.K. Employee’ s Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit shall be determined on the basis
of assuming that the Covered U.K. employee voluntarily terminated employment and any other service
relationship with the PepsiCo Organization as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date.
(d)    This subsection applies if the terms of the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan or the U.K. Supplementary
Pension Appendix are amended during a year in a way that would change the results under the Section F .3
calculation, and such amendment otherwise applies earlier than the immediately following year . In this case, to
the extent that doing is necessary to comply with Code Section 409A, the calculation in Section F .3 shall be
made by delaying the application of the amendment so that it is prospectively ef fective starting with the
immediately following year .
(e)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F , (ii) has reached
his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then again Engages in U.S. Service and meets all of the requirements to be a
Covered U.K. Employee when he again Engages in U.S. Service, the foregoing terms shall be applied again to
determine if he earns a benefit for the new period that he Engages in U.S. Service, except that any resulting
benefit from this new period shall be reduced by the lump sum value of any prior benefit under this Article F
(as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of benefits).
- 131 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(f)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F , (ii) has reached
his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then is employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification that would
be eligible for an accrual under the provisions of the Plan other than this Article F (the “Other Provisions”), then
the Other Provisions shall be applied to determine if he earns a benefit under the Other Provisions for the new
period of service, except that any resulting benefit from this new period of service shall be reduced by the lump
sum value of any prior benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of
benefits).
F.5    No Other Benefits :
A Covered U.K. Employee shall not be entitled to any other benefits under this Plan or the Salaried Plan while
he is a Covered U.K. Employee (or while he would be a Covered U.K. Employee if clauses (iv) and (v) of Section F .2.
were not included in the definition of Covered U.K. Employee). In addition, prior to the time that an individual has
satisfied all of the requirements to be considered a Covered U.K. Employee, the individual has no legally binding right
to a benefit under this Article F . Accordingly , for the avoidance of doubt, at any point before such time, the Company
may take action that prevents the individual from becoming entitled to a benefit under this Article F ( e.g., by deciding
that it will not designate the individual as a Covered U.K. Employee, in an unfettered exercise of the Company’ s
discretion), regardless of the services performed or other actions taken by the individual through this point in time,
and regardless of any other factor .

a)January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 Provisions  For applicable dates from January 1, 2016
through December 31, 2018, “Eligible Domestic Partner” status is not recognized under the Plan, in light of
the Supreme Court’ s 2015 decision that the Constitution guarantees the right to same-sex marriage.
1.Limited Exception for 2016 Plan Y ear. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and solely for applicable dates in
2016, in the case of a Participant who (i) has a relationship with an individual on December 31, 2015
that is recognized as an eligible domestic partner or civil union relationship under paragraph (2) below
and (ii) on any date during the 2015 Plan Y ear, is either an Employee who is actively employed or on an

same-sex marriage and the Participant has entered

into a same-sex civil union that is valid on the applicable date in the state in which it was entered
into, the Participant’ s Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) is the individual with whom the
Participant has entered into such a same-sex civil union. If a Participant resides in a state that

eligible to have an Eligible Domestic Partner unless the Participant is in a valid same-sex civil
union.
2.State of Residence Allows Neither Civil Unions Nor Marriage . If the Participant does not have an
Eligible Domestic Partner (and is not eligible to have one) pursuant to subsection (a) above, the
Participant’ s Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) is the individual with whom the Participant has
executed a legally binding same-sex domestic partner agreement that meets the requirements
set forth in writing by the Company with respect to eligibility for domestic partner benefits that is
in effect on the applicable date. If such Participant has not entered into such an agreement, the
Participant is not eligible to have an “Eligible Domestic Partner .
c)January 1, 2013 through June 25, 2013 Provisions . For applicable dates from January 1, 2013 through

includes the following: If on the applicable date the Participant has entered into a same-sex marriage that
is valid on the applicable date in the state in which it was entered into, the Participant’ s Eligible Domestic
Partner (if any) is the Participant’ s spouse pursuant to
- 136 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
such same-sex marriage. If the Participant resides in a state that permits same-sex marriage, the
Participant is not eligible to have an Eligible Domestic Partner unless either (a) the Participant is in a valid
same-sex marriage or (b) such state did not start to permit same-sex marriages until less than 12 months
before the applicable date.

dates covered by this H notwithstanding any provisions in paragraphs (1), (2),(3) or (4) to the contrary . The
term “Eligible Domestic Partner does not apply to an individual who is of the opposite sex of the
Participant. A Participant who lives in a state that permits same-sex marriage is not permitted to have an
Eligible Domestic Partner . In the case of applicable dates prior to January 1, 2016, if the Participant’ s state
started to permit same-sex marriage or same-sex civil unions less than 12 months before the applicable
date, the Participant is treated as residing in a state that does not permit same-sex marriage or same-sex
civil unions, as the case may be, for purposes of this definition of Eligible Domestic Partner .
f)Defined T erms . For purposes of the definition of “Eligible Domestic Partner” in this Article H, the following

APPENDIX ARTICLE I –
409A PEP Makeup for Certain Pre-409A Benefits
    
    I.1    Scope:
To ensure there will be no “material modification” of the Pre-409A Program, this Article provides a
makeup benefit under the 409A Program that applies to certain participants in the Pre-409A Program (“Pre-
409A Participants”) in lieu of updating the Pre-409A Program’ s actuarial factors for early commencement of
Vested Pensions to be consistent with the “2019 Salaried Program Factors” (as that term is defined in the
definition of Actuarial Equivalent). In the case of participants in the Pre-409A Program who are also
Participants in the 409A Program (without regard to this Article), this makeup relating to the early
commencement reduction of V ested Pensions payable as annuities is provided under the main text of the
Plan. However , this makeup is provided under this Article in the case of af fected Pre-409A Participants who
are otherwise not entitled to a benefit under the 409A Program.
I.2    Eligibility Under This Article :
To be eligible under this Article, an individual must be a Pre-409A Participant:
(a)    Who is paid a Pre-409A Pension that is (i) a “V ested Pension” under the Pre-409A Program, and
(ii) paid in the form of an annuity commencing as of a date prior to the Pre-409A Participant’ s Normal
Retirement Date but as of on or after January 1, 2019;
(b)     Whose Pre-409A Pension annuity under subsection (a) above is reduced for early
commencement under the terms of the Pre-409A Program by more
- 138 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
than it would be if the early commencement reduction were calculated using the 2019 Salaried Plan
Factors; and
(c)    Who otherwise would not have a 409A Pension that is payable ef fective as of January 1, 2019 or
later because, except as provided in this Article, the only PEP Pension to which the individual is entitled
is a Pre-409A Pension, or because his otherwise applicable 409A Pension commenced payment as of
prior to January 1, 2019.
An individual who satisfies all of the foregoing eligibility requirements shall be referred to as an “Eligible
Person” for purposes of this Article.
I.3    Benefit Amount Under This Article :
The benefit amount for an Eligible Person under this Article shall be the single lump sum that is the
Actuarial Equivalent of the dif ference between:
(a)    The Single Life Annuity that would be payable to the Eligible Person under the Pre-409A Program
as of the Eligible Person’ s Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program if the 2019 Salaried
Program Factors for early commencement applied in calculating such Single Life Annuity (including with
respect to any portion of the Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension that is derived from the PEP Guarantee),
and
(b)    The Single Life Annuity that is actually applicable to the Eligible Person under the Pre-409A
Program as of the Eligible Person’ s Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program, because of the
early commencement factors that
- 139 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
are actually applicable in calculating such Single Life Annuity (including with respect to any portion of
the Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension that is derived from the PEP Guarantee).
Such Actuarial Equivalent lump sum shall be calculated as of the applicable commencement date specified in
Section I.4 below; however , if the applicable commencement date is the Section I.4(b) date ( i.e. December 1,
2019) and the Eligible Person’ s actual Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program precedes December
1, 2019, then the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum shall be determined as of such actual Annuity Starting Date
and then brought forward with Actuarial Equivalent interest to December 1, 2019. For purposes of subsection
(a) above, the 2019 Salaried Program Factors shall be solely the new factors applicable under the Salaried
Program as of January 1, 2019 (and no alternative calculation using the factors in ef fect before January 1,
2019 shall apply).
I.4    Time of Payment Under This Article :
The lump sum benefit calculated under this Appendix shall be payable as of the Eligible Person’ s
applicable commencement date, which is the latest of the following:
(a)     The first of the month following the Eligible Person’ s Separation from Service,
(b)     December 1, 2019, or
- 140 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(c)     The first of the month following the Eligible Person’ s attainment of age 55 (except that this
subsection (c) shall not apply to the extent that the Eligible Person’ s benefit is derived from Article PBG
of this Appendix).
In the event that the Eligible Person’ s applicable commencement date is the date in subsection (a) above, then
the date of actual payment of the benefit shall be delayed to the extent provided by Section 6.6(a) of the main
text of the Plan, and in the case of such a delay , the benefit determined as of such applicable commencement
date shall be increased by interest for the period of delay as provided in Section 6.6(c) of the main text of the
Plan.
I.5    Non-Duplication of Benefits :
The foregoing Sections of this Article are intended to provide a make-up benefit under the 409A Program for applying
an early commencement reduction under the Pre-409A Program using factors that predate the 2019 Salaried Plan
Factors, with respect to a Pre-409A Pension that is paid in the form of an annuity and that has an Annuity Starting
Date of January 1, 2019 or later . However , no duplication of benefits may occur at any time under the Plan.
Therefore, to the extent an Eligible Person has received or will receive a 409A Pension that, without regard to this
Article, ef fectively provides some or all of such makeup ( e.g., because the Eligible Person’ s 409A Pension was
reduced for early commencement using Early Retirement reduction factors), or to the extent that the Plan
Administrator concludes that providing the makeup under this Article would otherwise result in a duplication of
benefits, the makeup benefit under this Article shall be reduced (but not below zero) as the Plan Administrator deems
appropriate to eliminate all
- 141 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
duplication of benefits. This provision shall govern over any contrary provision of this Article or the Plan that might be
interpreted to support a duplication of benefits.

ARTICLE I T O APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - HIST ORY AND PURPOSE
1.1    History of Plan . The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (“PBG”) established the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP”
or “Plan”) ef fective April 6, 1999 for the benefit of salaried employees of the PBG Organization who participate in the
PBG Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). The Plan was initially established as a successor plan to
the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan, due to PBG’ s April 6, 1999 initial public of fering, and the Plan included
historical PepsiCo provisions which are relevant for eligibility and benefit determinations under the Plan. The Plan
provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the
- 151 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, the Plan
provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula. Effective April 1, 2009,
the Plan also provides benefits for employees whose eligible pay under the Salaried Plan is reduced due to the
employees’ elective deferrals under the PBG Executive Income Deferral Program and for certain executives who
would be “Grandfathered Participants” under the Salaried Plan but for their classification as salary band E3-E8 or MP
(or its equivalent, for periods on and after the Ef fective T ime). The Plan is intended as a nonqualified unfunded
deferred compensation plan for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Plan is structured as two plans. The portion of the Plan that provides benefits
based on limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) is intended to be an “excess
benefit plan” as described in Section 4(b)(5) of ERISA. The remainder of the Plan is intended to be a plan described
in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA providing benefits to a select group of management or highly-
compensated employees.
The Plan has been amended from time to time, most recently in the form of an amendment and complete restatement
effective as of April 1, 2009 (“2009 Restatement”). PBG further amended the Plan as a result of the merger of PBG
with and into Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company , Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc. (the
“Company”), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 3, 2009 among PBG, the Company
and Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Company , Inc., and to facilitate the Company’ s assumption of PBG’ s role as the Plan’ s
sponsor .
1.2    Effect of Amendment and Restatement . The Plan as in ef fect on October 3, 2004 is referred to herein as the
Prior Plan.
- 152 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Except as otherwise explicitly provided in Section 6.1(b)(3) of this Plan, a Participant’ s benefit (including death
benefits), determined under the terms of the Plan as in ef fect on October 3, 2004 as if the Participant had terminated
employment on December 31, 2004, without regard to any compensation paid or services rendered after 2004, or any
other events af fecting the amount of or the entitlement to benefits (other than the Participant’ s survival or the
Participant’ s election under the terms of the Plan with respect to the time or form of benefit) (the “Grandfathered
Benefit”) shall be paid at the time and in the form provided by the terms of the Plan as in ef fect on October 3, 2004.
The benefit of a Participant accrued under this Plan based on all compensation and services taken into account by
the Prior Plan and this Plan, less the Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be paid in the times and in the form as
provided in this Plan. Except as otherwise explicitly provided in this Plan, this Plan superseded the Prior Plan
effective January 1, 2009, with respect to amounts accrued and vested after 2004 by Participants who had not
commenced receiving benefits as of January 1, 2009. The Plan was administered in accordance with a good faith
interpretation of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and IRS regulations and guidance thereunder from
January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2008. Amounts accrued under this Plan after 2004 shall be treated as
payable under a separate Plan for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

with respect to similarly situated employees).
The amount of the monthly pension benefit so determined, less the portion of such benefit that is the

Notwithstanding the above, in the event any portion of the accrued benefit of a Participant under this
Plan or the Salaried Plan is awarded to an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order , as
such terms are defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, the Participant’ s total PEP Pension shall be adjusted, as
the Plan Administrator shall determine, so that the combined benefit payable to the Participant and the

under paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).
(1)    Formula . The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this paragraph shall be
determined as follows:
(i)    Three percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for the first 10
years of Credited Service, plus
(ii)    One percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for each year of
Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less
(iii)    One and two-thirds percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount
multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.
In determining the amount of a V ested Pension, the PEP Guarantee shall first be calculated on
the basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he continued to accrue
Credited Service until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and
Primary Social Security Amount at the earlier of his Severance from Service Date or the date such
Participant ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and this Plan, and then
shall be reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Participant’ s actual years of Credited Service on the earlier of his Severance from Service Date or the
date such Participant ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and this Plan
and the denominator of which is the years of Credited Service
- 166 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
he would have earned had he continued to accrue Credited Service until his Normal Retirement Age.
(2)    Calculation . The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to paragraph
(1) above, subject to the following special rules:
(i)    Surviving Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Annuity : Subject to
subparagraph (iii) below and the last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner and has commenced receipt of an Annuity under
this section, the Participant’ s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be entitled to
receive a survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the Participant’ s Annuity under this section, with
no corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall begin on the first day of the month coincident
with or following the Participant’ s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to
the Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner is more than 10 years younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit
payable under this subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided below .
(A)    For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving Eligible
Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit
payable to such
- 167 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by 0.8 percent.
(B)    For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by an additional 0.4
percent.
This subparagraph applies only to a Participant who retires on or after his Early
Retirement Date.
(ii)    Reductions . The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’ s PEP
Guarantee.
(A)    If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment
amount shall be reduced by 3/12  of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit
commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal
Retirement Date.
(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment amount shall be
reduced to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date (if
payment commences before such date), and the reductions set forth in the Salaried Plan for any
Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s coverage or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s coverage shall apply .ths
- 168 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that
provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the life of the
surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner , that is greater than that provided under
subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be
reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial
Equivalent of the PEP Guarantee otherwise payable under the foregoing provisions of this
section.
(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that
provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic
Partner . In this instance, the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so
that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of
a Single Life Annuity for the Participant’ s life.
(E)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in an Annuity
form that includes inflation protection described in the Salaried Plan. In this instance, the
Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the
benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the elected Annuity
without such protection.
(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion . The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section
for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will
- 169 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
be distributed in the form of a lump sum shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP
Guarantee determined under this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under
subparagraph (i) above and any early retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
(iv)    April 1, 2009 Salaried Plan Changes.
(A)    The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section for a Participant
who, as of March 31, 2009, was classified as salary band E3-E8 or MP and who had attained
age 50 and completed five years of Service or (inclusively) whose sum of his age and years of
Service was at least 65 shall be determined as if such Participant were a Grandfathered
Participant in the Salaried Plan on April 1, 2009 (so that Earnings and Credited Service were not
frozen as of March 31, 2009 for the period April 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010).
(B)    Highest A verage Monthly Earnings shall be determined without regard to the
exclusion from Earnings under the Salaried Plan of amounts deferred at the election of the
Participant under the EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 2011.
4.3    Certain Adjustments . Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject to
adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan or a
nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored by a
member of the PBG Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals (this category of similar
plans includes the PepsiCo Prior Plan).
- 170 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(a)    Adjustments for Rehired Participants . This subsection shall apply to a current or former
Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and (i) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is
recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service, or (ii) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan
would have been recalculated, based on an additional period of Credited Service if the Participant would have
been considered a Grandfathered Participant as defined in Section 3.7 of the Salaried Plan if the Participant
was not classified by the Employer as salary band E3-E8 or MP . In such event, the Participant’ s PEP Pension
shall be recalculated hereunder . For this purpose, the PEP Guarantee under Section 4.2 is adjusted for in-
service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried
Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified plans.
(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans . If the benefit paid under a specified plan
on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the
increase is by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), the
PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder ,
the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically
intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.
(c)    No Benefit Offsets That W ould V iolate Section 409A . If a Participant has earned a benefit under
a plan maintained by a member of the PepsiCo/PBG Organization that is a “qualifying plan” for purposes of the
“Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.8 of Part A of the Salaried Plan and the “T ransfers and Non-Duplication”
rule in
- 171 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Section 3.6 of Part C of the Salaried Plan, such T ransfers and Non-Duplication rules shall apply when
calculating the amount determined under Section 4.1(a)(1) or 4.1(b)(1) above (as applicable) only to the extent
the application of such rule will not result in a change in the time or form of payment of such pension that is
prohibited by Section 409A. For purposes of the limit on of fsets in the preceding sentence, it is the Company’ s
intent to undertake to make special arrangements with respect to the payment of the benefit under the
qualifying plan that are legally permissible under the qualifying plan, and compliant with Section 409A, in order
to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the maximum extent possible; to the extent that Section
409A compliant special arrangements are timely put into ef fect in a particular situation, the limit on of fsets in
the prior sentence will not apply .
4.4    Reemployment of Certain Participants . In the case of a current or former Participant who is
reemployed and is eligible to reparticipate in the Salaried Plan after his Annuity Starting Date, payment of his non-
Grandfathered PEP Pension will not be suspended. If such Participant accrues an additional PEP Pension for service
after such reemployment, his PEP Pension on his subsequent Separation from Service shall be reduced by the
present value of PEP benefits previously distributed to such Participant, as determined by the Plan Administrator .
4.5    Vesting; Misconduct . Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant shall be fully vested in his Accrued Benefit at
the time he becomes fully vested in his accrued benefit under the Salaried Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, or
any other provision of the Plan to the contrary , a Participant shall forfeit his or her entire PEP Pension if the Plan
Administrator determines that such Participant has engaged in “Misconduct” as defined below , determined
- 172 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
without regard to whether the Misconduct occurred before or after the Participant’ s Severance from Service. The Plan
Administrator may , in its sole discretion, require the Participant to pay to the Employer any PEP Pension paid to the
Participant within the twelve month period immediately preceding a date on which the Participant has engaged in
such Misconduct, as determined by the Plan Administrator .
“Misconduct” means any of the following, as determined by the Plan Administrator in good faith: (i) violation of
any agreement between the Company or Employer and the Participant, including but not limited to a violation relating
to the disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers, suppliers,
licensors or contractors, or the performance of competitive services, (ii) violation of any duty to the Company or
Employer , including but not limited to violation of the Company’ s Code of Conduct; (iii) making, or causing or
attempting to cause any other person to make, any statement (whether written, oral or electronic), or conveying any
information about the Company or Employer which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the
Company or Employer unless required by law or pursuant to a Company or Employer policy; (iv) improperly
disclosing or otherwise misusing any confidential information regarding the Company or Employer; (v) unlawful
trading in the securities of the Company or of another company based on information garnered as a result of that
Participant’ s employment or other relationship with the Company; (vi) engaging in any act which is considered to be
contrary to the best interests of the Company or Employer , including but not limited to recruiting or soliciting
employees of the Employer; or (vii) commission of a felony or other serious crime or engaging in any activity which
constitutes gross misconduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall
prohibit the Participant from communicating with government
- 173 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
authorities concerning any possible legal violations.  The Company nonetheless asserts and does not waive its
attorney-client privilege over any information appropriately protected by the privilege.
ARTICLE V T O APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - DEA TH BENEFITS     
5.1    Death Benefits . Each Participant entitled to a PEP Pension under this Plan who dies before his Annuity

payable under the Salaried Plan instead of this Plan. The death benefit with respect to a Participant’ s PEP Pension in

employment date, or prior to attainment of age 65 and the fifth anniversary of the Participant’ s

- 177 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
dies: (i) after benefits have commenced; (ii) without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary , and
(iii) before receiving 120 payments under the form of payment, then the remaining payments due under
such form of payment shall be paid to the Participant’ s estate. If payments have commenced under
such form of payment to a Participant’ s primary or contingent beneficiary and such beneficiary dies
before payments are completed, then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be

6.4    Determination of Single Lump Sum Amounts . Except as otherwise provided below , a Single Lump
Sum payable under Article V or Section 6.1 shall be determined in the same manner as the single lump sum payment
option prescribed in Section 6.1(b)(3) of the Salaried Plan.
(a)    Vested Pensions . If on the date of Separation from Service of a Participant such Participant is not
entitled to retire with an immediate pension under the Salaried Plan, the Single Lump Sum payable to the
Participant under Section 6.1 shall be determined in the same manner as the single lump sum payment option
prescribed in Section 6.1(b)(3) of the Salaried Plan but substituting (for Plan Y ears beginning before 2012) the
applicable segment rates for the blended 30 year T reasury and segment rates that would otherwise be
applicable.

Participant whose employment was involuntarily terminated as a result of the 2008 Reorganization on or after
November 1, 2008 and on or before December 19, 2008 shall be determined based on the applicable interest
rates and mortality used by the Salaried Plan for optional lump sum distributions in December 2008, provided
that in no event shall such Single Lump Sum payment be less than the Single Lump Sum determined based
on the applicable interest rates and mortality used by the Salaried Plan for lump sum distributions for the
month in which the Single Lump Sum is distributed to the Participant.
6.5    Section 162(m) Postponement . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , no
PEP Pension shall be paid to any Participant prior to the earliest date on which the Company’ s federal income tax
deduction for such payment is not precluded by
- 179 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Section 162(m) of the Code. In the event any payment is delayed solely as a result of the preceding restriction, such
payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible following the first date as of which Section 162(m) of the
Code no longer precludes the deduction by the Company of such payment. Amounts deferred because of the Section
162(m) deduction limitation shall be increased by simple interest for the period of delay at the annual rate of six
percent (6%).

ARTICLE I – INTRODUCTION
    PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Company”) established the PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program (the “Plan”) in 1972 to permit
eligible executives to defer certain cash awards made under its executive compensation programs. Deferrals under the Plan that
were earned and vested on or before December 31, 2004 are governed by a separate set of documents that set forth the pre-
Section 409A terms of the Plan (the “Pre-409A Program”). The terms of the Plan that are applicable to deferrals that are subject
to Section 409A, i.e., generally , deferred amounts that are earned or vested after December 31, 2004 (the “409A Program”) are
governed by this document. This document sets forth the 409A Program and is ef fective as of January 1, 2005 (the “Ef fective
Date”). Except as otherwise provided herein, this document reflects the provisions in ef fect from and after January 1, 2005, and
the rights and benefits of individuals who are Participants in the Plan from and after that date (and of those claiming through or
on behalf of such individuals) shall be governed by the provisions of this document in the case of actions and events occurring on
or after the Ef fective Date with respect to deferrals that are subject to the 409A Program. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
the term “actions and events” shall include all distribution trigger events and dates. The rights and benefits with respect to
persons who only participated in the Plan prior to January 1, 2005 shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the Pre-409A
Program documents that were in ef fect at such time, and shall not be governed by the 409A Program documents.
    Together , the documents for the 409A Program and the documents for the Pre-409A Program describe the terms of a single
plan. However , amounts subject to the terms of the 409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program
shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification,
and the separation between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to permit the Pre-409A
Program to remain exempt from Section 409A, and the administration of the Plan shall be consistent with this intent.
        This document for the 409A Program was most recently restated ef fective as of January 1, 2022 (with later ef fective dates
for certain provisions). This restatement reflects the sale of the juice business, and it updates the Plan’ s provision relating to
exhaustion of administrative remedies.
For federal income tax purposes, the Plan is intended to be a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that is unfunded
and unsecured. For purposes of ERISA, the Plan is intended to be a plan described in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of
ERISA providing unfunded benefits to a select group of management or highly compensated employees.

Executive subsequently is not paid in U.S. dollars or is paid from a non-U.S. payroll, and (iii) regardless of whether such
individual is transferred to an af filiate of the Company , if such transfer to an af filiate is not a Separation from Service;

        (c)    Each Eligible Executive becomes an active Participant on the date an amount is first withheld from his or her
compensation pursuant to an Election Form submitted by the Executive to the Recordkeeper (or , if authorized, the Plan
Administrator) under Section 4.01.
3.02    Termination of Eligibility to Defer:
An individual’ s eligibility to participate actively by making deferrals (or a deferral election) under Article IV shall cease
upon the “Election T ermination Date” (as defined below) occurring after the earliest of:
 
(a)     The date he or she Separates from Service; or
 
(b)     The date that the Executive ceases to be eligible under criteria described in Section 3.01(a).
    An individual’ s “Election T ermination Date” shall be a date as soon as administratively practicable following the date in
Subsection (a) or (b) (or such other date as may be determined in accordance with rules of the Plan Administrator); provided that
an Election T ermination Date shall not af fect any election already made that otherwise has become irrevocable in accordance
with the rules of this Plan. However , the occurrence of an Election T ermination Date shall terminate any election that has been
made that is not yet required to become irrevocable under rules of the Plan Administrator that are intended to permit compliance
with Section 409A.
3.03    Termination of Participation:
    An individual, who has been an active Participant under the Plan, ceases to be a Participant on the date his or her Account is
fully paid out; provided, however , even if a Participant’ s Account is fully paid out, participation shall continue under the Plan if a
deferral will be credited to the Participant’ s Account in the future ( e.g., a deferral of Bonus Compensation that is paid in a future
year).
3.04    Acquisitions and Divestitures:
A written agreement between an Employer and a party that is not part of the PepsiCo Or ganization regarding the purchase
or sale of a business unit, division, or subsidiary (“Business”) may provide for the termination or commencement of the
participation of Executives in this Plan. Absent a specific provision in such agreement to the contrary:
(a) Each Executive of a Business that is sold shall cease being eligible for this Plan upon such sale (subject to
the transitional extension of participation under Section 3.01(a) in the case of a sale that does not result in a Separation from
Service as a result of the 20% af filiate rule in the definition of Separation from Service); and
(b) No Executive of a Business that is acquired shall be eligible for this Plan except as otherwise designated in
the Plan or in such documents related to the Plan as the Plan Administrator may designate from time to time.
For purposes of Article IX (amendment and termination of the Plan), an Employer ’s approval and execution of a written
agreement of acquisition or divesture, which is described in the first sentence of this Section, constitutes approval by the
Company of the provisions of the agreement that relate to participation in this Plan.
11
3.05    Special Rules for Certain Executives:
For Plan Y ears beginning on and after January 1, 2020 and for Performance Periods ending after December 31, 2019, in
the case of an Executive who is an of ficer within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Section 16
Officer”), the Section 16 Of ficer’s eligibility shall be determined under the Plan’ s provisions in ef fect as of January 1, 2019 (the
“2019 Provisions”) and as provided in this Section 3.05. To provide for the eligibility of Section 16 Of ficers under the 2019
Provisions consistently with the Plan’ s exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to Rule 506 of
Regulation D, the Plan will comply with Rule 506(b), including by determining the Section 16 Of ficers’ accredited investor
status using any basis permissible under Rule 506(b) (notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.01(a)(1)). In addition,
in the case of a Section 16 Of ficer who becomes newly eligible for the Plan under circumstances that qualify for the special 30-
day election period permitted by T reasury Regulation § 1.409A-2(a)(7), the Section 16 Of ficer shall be entitled to make a deferral
election for Base Compensation during a 30-day election period pursuant to the 2019 Provisions.
12
ARTICLE IV – DEFERRAL OF COMPENSA TION
4.01    Deferral Election:
        (a)    Deferrals of Base Compensation . Effective on or after January 1, 2010, each Eligible Executive may make an election
to defer under the Plan any whole percentage up to 75% of his or her Base Compensation in the manner described in
Section 4.02. The Plan Administrator shall be entitled to specify on the Election Form applicable to a particular deferral election
(or in other documentation applicable to such deferral election) a lower percentage limitation on the amount of Base
Compensation that may be deferred pursuant to such deferral election. Any such specification shall be made in writing no later
than the date on which such deferral election becomes irrevocable pursuant to Section 4.02. Any changes in such specification
from that in ef fect on January 1, 2019 shall be subject to Section 7.06.
        (b)    Deferrals of Bonus Compensation .
(1)    General Rules . Effective on or after May 21, 2010, each Eligible Executive may make an election to
defer under the Plan any whole percentage up to 100% of his or her Bonus Compensation in the manner described in
Section 4.02. The Plan Administrator shall be entitled to specify on the Election Form applicable to a particular deferral
election (or in other documentation applicable to such deferral election) a lower percentage limitation on the amount of
Bonus Compensation that may be deferred pursuant to such deferral election. Any such specification shall be made in
writing no later than the date on which such deferral election becomes irrevocable pursuant to Section 4.02. Any changes
in such specification from that in ef fect on January 1, 2019 shall be subject to Section 7.06.
(2)    Special Rules for Promoted Eligible Executives for Performance Periods Ending Before 2020 . For
Performance Periods ending before January 1, 2020, an Eligible Executive that becomes an Eligible Executive during a
Plan Y ear as a result of a promotion from below LG2 into a position that is LG2 or above shall only be eligible to defer
Bonus Compensation earned for such Performance Period in which he or she is promoted, if the Eligible Executive (i) is a
bonus-eligible Executive for all of such Plan Y ear and (ii) is promoted by May 15  of the Plan Y ear in which the
promotion occurs (for periods before January 1, 2017, references in this paragraph to “LG2” shall be applied as references
to “Band II”). If a promoted Eligible Executive does not satisfy the requirements of the previous sentence, he or she shall
not be eligible to defer Bonus Compensation earned for the Performance Period relating to the Plan Y ear in which he or
she is promoted.
(3)    Performance Criteria for Performance Periods Ending Before 2020 . For Performance Periods ending
before January 1, 2020, notwithstanding Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) above, an Eligible Executive shall not be eligible to
defer Bonus Compensation for a Plan Y ear unless (i) the Bonus Compensation is contingent on the satisfaction of
organizational or individual performance criteria for the Performance Period that relates to the Plan Y ear, (ii) such criteria
have been established in writing by not later than 90 days after the beginning of the applicable Performance Period, and
(iii) the Bonus Compensation otherwise satisfies the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section
409A.
        (c)    Election Form Rules . To be ef fective in deferring Base Compensation or Bonus Compensation, an Eligible Executive’ s
Election Form must set forth the percentage of Base Compensation or Bonus Compensation (whichever applies) to be deferred,
the deferralth
13
period under Section 4.03, the form of payment under Section 4.04, and any other information that may be required by the Plan
Administrator from time to time. In addition, the Election Form must meet the requirements of Section 4.02. It is contemplated
that an Eligible Executive will specify the investment choice under Section 5.02 (in multiples of 1%) for the Eligible Executive’ s
deferral. However , this is not a condition for making an ef fective election.
4.02    Time and Manner of Deferral Election:
        (a)    Deferrals of Base Compensation .
(1)    In General . An Eligible Executive must make a deferral election for a Plan Y ear with respect to Base
Compensation no later than December 31 of the year prior to the Plan Y ear in which the Base Compensation would
otherwise be paid. If December 31(or an applicable earlier day) is not a business day , the deadline shall be the nearest
preceding day that is a business day . Notwithstanding the prior two sentences, the Plan Administrator may adopt policies
and procedures that encourage or require earlier submission of Election Forms, but in which case any requirement for the
earlier submission of an Election Form may be waived (but not beyond the date specified by the first sentence of this
subsection) by the Plan Administrator to prevent undue hardship for one or more Eligible Executives. Any changes in
such policies or procedures or in established waiver practices from those applicable on January 1, 2019 shall be subject to
Section 7.06.
(2)    Mid-Y ear Elections for Plan Y ears Before 2020 . For Plan Y ears ending before January 1, 2020,
subject to the last sentence of Section 3.01(a)(2) and (for later Plan Y ears) Section 3.05, an individual who newly becomes
an Eligible Executive will have 30 days from the date the individual becomes an Eligible Executive to make a deferral
election with respect to Base Compensation that is earned for services performed after the election is received (the “30-
Day Election Period”). The 30-Day Election Period may be used to make an election for Base Compensation that
otherwise would be paid in the Plan Y ear in which the individual becomes an Eligible Executive. In addition, the 30-Day
Election Period may be used to make an election for Base Compensation that would otherwise be paid in the next Plan
Year (i.e., the Plan Y ear following when the individual becomes an Eligible Executive), if the individual becomes an
Eligible Executive not later than December 31 of a Plan Y ear. Thus, if a Base Compensation deferral election for a Plan
Year is made in reliance on the 30-day rule, then the Plan Administrator shall apply the restriction that the election may
only apply to Base Compensation earned for services performed after the date the election is received by the
Recordkeeper .
        (b)    Deferrals of Bonus Compensation .
(1)     Performance Periods Ending After 2019 . In the case of an Eligible Executive’ s Bonus Compensation
that relates to a Performance Period ending after December 31, 2019, an Eligible Executive must make a deferral election
with respect to such Bonus Compensation no later than the last day of the Company’ s fiscal year that ends just before
such Performance Period. If the last day of such fiscal year is not a business day , the deadline shall be the nearest
preceding day that is a business day .
(2)     Performance Periods Ending Before 2019 . In the case of an Eligible Executive’ s Bonus
Compensation that relates to a Performance Period ending before December 31, 2019, the Eligible Executive must make a
deferral election with respect to his or her Bonus Compensation at least six months prior to the end of the Performance
Period for which the applicable Bonus Compensation is paid, and this election will be the Eligible Executive’ s bonus
deferral election for the Plan Y ear to
14
which the Performance Period relates. This applies to both continuing Eligible Executives and individuals who newly
become Eligible Executives. Accordingly , if an individual becomes an Eligible Executive during a Plan Y ear as a result of
a promotion and is eligible to defer Bonus Compensation under Section 4.01(b) for such Plan Y ear, such Eligible
Executive must make a deferral election for Bonus Compensation that is earned for the Performance Period that relates to
the Plan Y ear in which he or she is promoted at least six months prior to the end of the applicable Performance Period.
Notwithstanding the provisions in Paragraphs (1) and (2) above, the Plan Administrator may adopt policies and
procedures that encourage or require earlier submission of Election Forms, but in which case any requirement for the earlier
submission of an Election Form may be waived (but not beyond the date otherwise applicable under Paragraph (1) and (2) above)
by the Plan Administrator to prevent undue hardship for one or more Eligible Executives. Any changes in such policies or
procedures or in established waiver practices from those applicable on January 1, 2019 shall be subject to Section 7.06.
        (c)    General Provisions . For purposes of Section 3.01 and this Section 4.02, the period of time to make the deferral election
described under (a) and (b) above shall be referred to as the Deferral W indow . A separate deferral election under (a) or (b) above
must be made by an Eligible Executive for each category of a Plan Y ear’s compensation that is eligible for deferral. If a properly
completed and executed Election Form is not actually received by the Recordkeeper (or , if authorized, the Plan Administrator) by
the deadline applicable under Subsections (a) and (b) above, the Eligible Executive will be deemed to have elected not to defer
any Base Compensation or Bonus Compensation, as the case may be, for the applicable Plan Y ear or the Performance Period that
relates to the Plan Y ear, as applicable. Except as provided below in this Subsection, an election is irrevocable by the Eligible
Employee once received and determined by the Plan Administrator to be properly completed (and such determination shall be
made not later than the last date for making the election in question). The Plan Administrator , however , may cancel elections that
have been received and accepted for a Plan Y ear up until the end of the day on the December 31 that precedes such Plan Y ear .
Increases or decreases in the amount or percentage a Participant has elected to defer shall not be permitted during a Plan Y ear.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, ef fective as of January 1, 2008, if a Participant receives a hardship distribution under a cash or
deferred profit sharing plan that is sponsored by a member of the PepsiCo Or ganization and such plan requires that deferrals
under such plan be suspended for a period of time following the hardship distribution, the Plan Administrator may cancel the
Participant’ s deferral election under this Plan so that no deferrals shall be made during such suspension period. If an election is
cancelled because of a hardship distribution in accordance with the prior sentence, such cancellation shall permanently apply to
the deferral election or elections for any Plan Y ear covered by such suspension period and the Participant will only be eligible to
make a new deferral election for the Plan Y ear that begins after the end of the suspension period, and such new election shall be
made in accordance with the rules of Sections 4.01 and 4.02.
        (d)    Beneficiaries .
(1) A Participant may designate on the Election Form (or in some other manner authorized by the Plan
Administrator) one or more Beneficiaries to receive payment, in the event of his or her death, of the amounts credited to
his or her Account; provided that, to be ef fective, any Beneficiary designation must be in writing, signed by the
Participant, and must meet such other standards (including any requirement for spousal consent) as the Plan Administrator
or Recordkeeper shall require from time to time. The Beneficiary designation must also be filed with the Recordkeeper
(or the Plan Administrator for periods prior to June 3, 2002) prior to the Participant’ s death. An incomplete Beneficiary
designation, as determined by the Recordkeeper or Plan
15
Administrator , shall be void and of no ef fect. In determining whether a Beneficiary designation that relates to the Plan is
in effect, unrevoked designations that were received under the Pre-409A Program or prior to the Ef fective Date shall be
considered. A Beneficiary designation of an individual by name remains in ef fect regardless of any change in the
designated individual’ s relationship to the Participant. Solely for periods prior to June 3, 2002, a Beneficiary designation
solely by relationship (for example, a designation of “spouse,” that does not give the name of the spouse) shall designate
whoever is the person in that relationship to the Participant at his or her death. However , any Beneficiary designation
submitted to the Recordkeeper from and after June 3, 2002 that only specifies a Beneficiary by relationship shall not be
considered an ef fective Beneficiary designation and shall be void and of no ef fect. If more than one Beneficiary is
specified and the Participant fails to indicate the respective percentage applicable to two or more Beneficiaries, then each
Beneficiary for whom a percentage is not designated will be entitled to an equal share of the portion of the Account (if
any) for which percentages have not been designated. At any time, a Participant may change a Beneficiary designation for
his or her Account in a writing that is signed by the Participant and filed with the Recordkeeper prior to the Participant’ s
death, and that meets such other standards as the Plan Administrator shall require from time to time. An individual who is
otherwise a Beneficiary with respect to a Participant’ s Account ceases to be a Beneficiary when all payments have been
made from the Account.
(2)    If the Participant designates a Beneficiary and such Beneficiary survives the Participant, but dies
prior to the complete distribution of such Beneficiary’ s interest in the Participant’ s Account, the Plan Administrator shall
direct the Recordke eper to pay such Beneficiary’ s remaining interest in the Participant’ s Account to the Beneficiary’ s
estate.
4.03    Period of Deferral:
An Eligible Executive making a deferral election shall specify a deferral period on his or her Election Form by designating
either a Specific Payment Date or the date he or she incurs a Separation from Service. In no event shall an Eligible Executive’ s
deferral period end later than his or her 80  birthday , regardless of whether the Participant chose a single lump sum or
installments as the form of payment. Notwithstanding an Eligible Executive’ s actual election of a Specific Payment Date, an
Eligible Executive shall be deemed to have elected a period of deferral of not less than:
 
(a)     For Base Compensation that is paid from and after January 1, 2008, at least twelve (12) months after the end of
the Plan Y ear during which the Base Compensation would have been paid absent the deferral; and
 
(b)     For Bonus Compensation that is paid from and after January 1, 2008, at least eighteen (18) months after the
date the Bonus Compensation would have been paid absent the deferral.
 
    In the case of a deferral to a Specific Payment Date, if an Eligible Executive’ s Election Form either fails to specify a period of
deferral or specifies a period less than the applicable minimum, the Eligible Executive shall be deemed to have selected a
Specific Payment Date equal to the minimum period of deferral as provided in Subsections (a) and (b) above.
4.04    Form of Deferral Payout:
An Eligible Executive making a deferral election shall specify a form of payment on his or her Election Form by
designating either a lump sum payment or installment payments to beth
16
paid over a period of no more than 20 years, and not later than the Executive’ s 80  birthday . Any election for installment
payments shall also specify (a) the frequency for which installment payments shall be paid, which shall be quarterly , semi-
annually and annually and (b) whether the installment payments shall be paid in a fixed dollar amount or for a fixed number of
years. Installment elections for a fixed dollar amount shall be paid based on the selected frequency and the selected amount until
the applicable Deferral Subaccount is exhausted, but shall not be paid for a period of more than 20 years and not later than the
Executive’ s 80  birthday . If an Eligible Executive elects installments for a period extending beyond the Eligible Executive’ s 80
birthday (or for purposes of a fixed dollar amount installment election, the installments would continue beyond the Executive’ s
80 birthday or beyond 20 years), such election shall be treated as an election for installments over a period of whole and partial
years that ends on the Eligible Executive’ s 80  birthday or , if earlier , at the end of 20 years; provided that the amounts to be
distributed in connection with the installments prior to the Eligible Executive’ s 80  birthday or prior to the end of 20 years shall
be determined in accordance with Section 6.08 and his or her election by assuming that the installments shall continue for the full
number of installments or the elected fixed dollar amount, with the entire remaining amount of the relevant Deferral Subaccount
distributed on the Eligible Executive’ s 80  birthday or at the end of 20 years.
4.05    Second Look Elections:
    (a)    In General . Subject to Subsection (b) below and the next sentence, a Participant who has made a valid initial
deferral in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Article may subsequently make additional elections regarding the
time and/or form of payment of his or her deferral. This opportunity to modify the Participant’ s initial election is referred to as a
“Second Look Election.” For periods before January 1, 2020, a Participant was eligible to make only one Second Look Election
with respect to each individual deferral of Base or Bonus Compensation.
    
    (b)    Requirements for Second Look Elections . A Second Look Election is subject to all of the conditions of Subsection
(a) above and must comply with all of the following requirements:
        (1)    If a Participant’ s initial election for a deferral (or the latest subsequent Second Look Election) specified
payment based on a Specific Payment Date, the Participant may only change the payment terms for such deferral through
a current Second Look Election if the election is made at least 12 months before the Participant’ s original (or if
applicable, last subsequently elected) Specific Payment Date. In addition, in this case the Participant’ s current Second
Look Election must delay the payment of the Participant’ s deferral to a new Specific Payment Date that is at least five
years after the original (or if applicable, last subsequently elected) Specific Payment Date.
        (2)    If a Participant’ s initial election specified payment based on the Participant’ s Separation from Service, the
Participant may only make a Second Look Election if the election is made at least 12 months before the Participant’ s
Separation from Service and the Participant separates from Service for Retirement. In addition, in this case the
Participant’ s Second Look Election must delay the payment of the Participant’ s deferral for at least five years. For
example, the Second Look Election must delay the payment of the Participant’ s deferral to a Specific Payment Date that
turns out to be at least five years after the later of (i) the Participant’ s Separation from Service or (ii) the last designated
period following the Participant’ s Separation from Service that was designated in a prior Second Look Election.
Alternatively , the Second Look Election may delay the payment of the Participant’ s deferral for a designated period of
five years (or more) following the later of (A) the Participant’ s Separation from Service or (B) the end of the last period
following the Participant’ s Separation from Service that wasth
th th
th
th
th
th
17
designated in a prior Second Look Election. If the five-year delay election is made by selecting a Specific Payment Date
that turns out to be less than five years after the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or if later , the last designated
period following the Participant’ s Separation from Service), the Second Look Election is void and payment shall be made
based on the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or if later , the last validly designated period following the
Participant’ s Separation from Service).
        (3)    For periods before January 1, 2013, neither a Separation from Service nor a period of delay after a Separation
from Service could be specified as the payout date resulting from a Second Look Election.
        (4)    To the extent permitted by Subsection (a) above, a Participant may make an unlimited number of Second Look
Elections for each individual deferral, however , each Second Look Election must comply with all of the requirements of
this Section 4.05.
    (5)    A Participant who changes the form of his or her payment election from lump sum to installments will be
subject to the provisions of the Plan regarding installment payment elections in Section 4.04, and such installment
payments must begin no earlier than five years after when the lump sum payment would have been paid based upon the
Participant’ s initial election (or , if applicable, any subsequent Second Look Election). A Participant may not make a
Second Look Election if the election would provide for installment payments to be made after the Participant’ s 80
birthday .
    (6)    If a Participant’ s initial election (or any subsequent Second Look Election) specified payment in the form
of installments and the Participant wants to elect installment payments over a greater or lesser number of years or wants to
elect a dif ferent frequency of installment payments ( e.g., change from annual installments to quarterly installments), the
election will be subject to the provisions of the Plan regarding installment payment elections in Section 4.04, and the first
payment date of the new installment payment schedule must be no earlier than five years after the first payment date that
applied under the Participant’ s initial (or , if applicable, subsequent) installment election. A Participant may not make a
Second Look Election if the election would provide for installment payments to be made after the Participant’ s 80
birthday .
    (7)    If a Participant’ s initial election (or subsequent Second Look Election) specified payment in the form of
installments and the Participant wants to elect instead payment in a lump sum, the earliest payment date of the lump sum
must be no earlier than five years after the first payment date that applied under the Participant’ s initial (or , if applicable,
subsequent) installment election.
    (8)    For purposes of this Section and Code Section 409A, all of a Participant’ s installment payments related to
a specific deferral election shall be treated as a single payment.
    A Second Look Election will be void and payment will be made based on the Participant’ s original election under Sections
4.03 and 4.04 if all of the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs of this subsection are not satisfied in full. However , if a
Participant’ s Second Look Election becomes ef fective in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the Participant’ s
original (or , if applicable, subsequent) election shall be superseded (including any Specific Payment Date specified therein), and
this original (or , if applicable, subsequent) election shall not be taken into account with respect to the deferral that is subject to the
effective Second Look Election.th
th
18
        (c)    Plan Administrator ’s Role . Each Participant has the sole responsibility to elect a Second Look Election by contacting
the Recordkeeper (or , if authorized, the Plan Administrator) and to comply with the requirements of this Section. The Plan
Administrator or the Recordkeeper may provide a notice of a Second Look Election opportunity to some or all Participants, but
the Recordkeeper and Plan Administrator are under no obligation to provide such notice (or to provide it to all Participants, in the
event a notice is provided only to some Participants). The Recordkeeper and the Plan Administrator have no discretion to waive
or otherwise modify any requirement for a Second Look Election set forth in this Section or in Section 409A.
19
ARTICLE V – INTERESTS OF P ARTICIP ANTS
5.01    Accounting for Participants’ Interests:
        (a)    Deferral Subaccounts . Each Participant shall have at least one separate Deferral Subaccount for each separate deferral
of Base Compensation or Bonus Compensation made by the Participant under this Plan. A Participant’ s deferral shall be credited
as of the date of the deferral to his or her Account as soon as administratively practicable following the date the compensation
would be paid in the absence of a deferral. A Participant’ s Account is a bookkeeping device to track the value of the Participant’ s
deferrals (and his or her Employer ’s liability therefor). No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with any Account,
and no Account shall be insured or otherwise secured.
        (b)    Account Earnings or Losses . As of each V aluation Date, a Participant’ s Account shall be credited with earnings and
gains (and shall be debited for expenses and losses) determined as if the amounts credited to his or her Account had actually been
invested as directed by the Participant in accordance with this Article (as modified by Section 5.05, if applicable). The Plan
provides only for “phantom investments,” and therefore such earnings, gains, expenses and losses are hypothetical and not actual.
However , they shall be applied to measure the value of a Participant’ s Account and the amount of his or her Employer ’s liability
to make deferred payments to or on behalf of the Participant.
5.02    Investment Options:
        (a)    General . Each of a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts shall be invested on a phantom basis in any combination of
phantom investment options specified by the Participant (or following the Participant’ s death, by his or her Beneficiary) from
those of fered by the Plan Administrator for this purpose from time to time. The Plan Administrator may discontinue any phantom
investment option with respect to some or all Accounts, and it may provide rules for transferring a Participant’ s phantom
investment from the discontinued option to a specified replacement option (unless the Participant selects another replacement
option in accordance with such requirements as the Plan Administrator may apply).
        (b)    Phantom Investment Options . The basic phantom investment options of fered under the Plan are as follows:
            (1)    Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund . Participant Accounts invested in this phantom option are adjusted to reflect
an investment in the PepsiCo Common Stock Fund, which is of fered under the PepsiCo Savings Plan (or such similar plan
as may be of fered by the Company from time to time). An amount deferred or transferred into this option is converted to
phantom units in the PepsiCo Common Stock Fund by dividing such amount by the NA V of the fund on the V aluation
Date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator . A Participant’ s interest in the
Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund is valued as of a V aluation Date (or a Distribution V aluation Date) by multiplying
the number of phantom units credited to the Participant’ s Account on such date by the NA V of a unit in the PepsiCo
Common Stock Fund on such date. If shares of PepsiCo Common Stock change by reason of any stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, mer ger, consolidation, spin-of f, combination or exchange of shares or other any other corporate
change treated as subject to this provision by the Plan Administrator , such equitable adjustment shall be made in the
number and kind of phantom units credited to an Account or subaccount as the Plan Administrator may determine to be
necessary or appropriate. In no event will shares of PepsiCo Common Stock actually be purchased or held under this Plan,
and no Participant
20
shall have any rights as a shareholder of PepsiCo Common Stock on account of an interest in this phantom option.
    
        (2)    Phantom AFR Fund : This fund is established ef fective from and after December 29, 2006. Participant Accounts
invested in this phantom option accrue a return based upon an interest rate that is 120% of the applicable Federal long-
term rate (pursuant to Code Section 1274(d) or any successor provision) applicable for annual compounding, as published
by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service from time to time. Returns accrue for each month based upon 120% of the
applicable Federal long-term rate (applicable for annual compounding) in ef fect on the first business day of each month
and are compounded annually . An amount deferred or transferred into this option is credited with the applicable rate of
return beginning with the date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator .
        (3)    Other Funds . From time to time, the Plan Administrator shall designate which (if any) other investment options
shall be available as phantom investment options under this Plan. These phantom investment options shall be described in
materials provided to Participants from time to time. Any of these phantom investment options shall be administered
under procedures implemented from time to time by the Plan Administrator . Unless otherwise specified in these materials
or procedures, in the case of any such phantom investment option that is based on a unitized fund, an amount deferred or
transferred into such option is converted to phantom units in the applicable fund of equivalent value by dividing such
amount by the NA V of a unit in such fund on the V aluation Date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this
option by the Plan Administrator . Thereafter , a Participant’ s interest in each such phantom option is valued as of a
Valuation Date (or a Distribution V aluation Date) by multiplying the number of phantom units credited to his or her
Account on such date by the NA V of a unit in such fund on such date.
5.03    Method of Allocation:
    (a)     Deferral Elections . With respect to any deferral election by a Participant, the Participant may use his or her
Election Form to allocate the deferral in one percent increments among the phantom investment options then of fered by the Plan
Administrator . If an Election Form related to an original deferral election specifies phantom investment options for less than
100% of the Participant’ s deferral, the Recordkeeper shall allocate the Participant’ s deferrals to the Phantom AFR Fund to the
extent necessary to provide for investment of 100% of the Participant’ s deferral. If an Election Form related to an original
deferral election specifies phantom investment options for more than 100% of the Participant’ s deferral, the Recordkeeper shall
prorate all of the Participant’ s investment allocations to the extent necessary to reduce (after rounding to whole percents) the
Participant’ s aggregate investment percentages to 100%.
    (b)     Fund T ransfers . A Participant may reallocate previously deferred amounts in a Deferral Subaccount by properly
completing and submitting a fund transfer form provided by the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper and specifying, in
increments permitted by the Plan Administrator , the reallocation of his or her Deferral Subaccount among the phantom
investment options then of fered by the Plan Administrator for this purpose. (The rules relating to non-paper formats for Election
Forms shall also apply to the fund transfer form.) Effective as of January 1, 2020, the increments permitted by the Plan
Administrator are whole percentages, whole shares or whole dollars, as specified in the fund transfer forms provided to
Participants and authorized by the Plan Administrator . If a fund transfer form provides for investing less than or more than 100%
of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount, it will be void and disregarded. Any transfer form that is not void under the preceding
sentence shall be ef fective as of the V aluation Date next occurring after its receipt by the Recordkeeper , but the Plan
Administrator or Recordkeeper
21
may also specify a minimum number of days in advance of which such transfer form must be received in order for the form to
become ef fective as of such next V aluation Date. If more than one fund transfer form is received on a timely basis, the form that
the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper determines to be the most recent shall be followed.
    (c)     Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund Restrictions . Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section,
the Plan Administrator may at any time alter the ef fective date of any investment or allocation involving the Phantom PepsiCo
Common Stock Fund pursuant to Section 7.03(j) (relating to safeguards against insider trading). The Plan Administrator may
also, to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with Rule 16b-3(f) of the Act, arrange for tracking of any such transaction
defined in Rule 16b-3(b)(1) of the Act and bar any such transaction to the extent it would not be exempt under Rule 16b-3(f). The
Company may also impose blackout periods pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 whenever the
Company determines that circumstances warrant. Further , the Company may impose quarterly blackout periods on insider trading
in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund as needed (as determined by the Company), timed to coincide with the release of
the Company’ s quarterly earnings reports. The commencement and termination of these blackout periods in each quarter , the
parties to which they apply and the activities they restrict shall be as set forth in the of ficial insider trading policy promulgated by
the Company from time to time. These provisions shall apply notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary except
Section 7.07 (relating to compliance with Section 409A).
        
5.04    Vesting of a Participant’s Account:
A Participant’ s interest in the value of his or her Account shall at all times be 100 percent vested, which means that it will
not forfeit as a result of his or her Separation from Service.
5.05    Forfeiture of Earnings for Prohibited Misconduct:
    Ef fective beginning with deferrals for Bonus Compensation for the 2006 Plan Y ear and deferrals for Base Compensation for
the 2007 Plan Y ear, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the Plan Administrator determines that
a Participant has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of his or her Separation from
Service, the Participant shall forfeit all current and future net earnings and gains that have been or will be credited to his or her
Account under the provisions of Sections 5.01(b) and/or 6.08, and his or her Account balance shall be adjusted to reflect such
forfeiture. Accordingly , a Participant who has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct during such period shall only be eligible to
receive a distribution of the lesser of: (a) the aggregate amount of his or her Base Compensation and Bonus Compensation
deferrals under this Plan that relate to elections made for and after the 2006 Plan Y ear for Bonus Compensation and the 2007 Plan
Year for Base Compensation (the “Af fected Deferrals”), or (b) the net value of the Participant’ s Affected Deferrals as of the date
the Plan Administrator determines that the Participant has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct.
22
ARTICLE VI – DISTRIBUTIONS
6.01    General:
A Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount(s) that are governed by the terms of this 409A Program shall be distributed as
provided in this Article, subject in all cases to Section 7.03(j) (relating to safeguards against insider trading) and Section 7.06
(relating to compliance with Section 16 of the Act). All Deferral Subaccount balances (including those hypothetically invested in
the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund) shall be distributed in cash. In no event shall any portion of a Participant’ s Account
be distributed earlier or later than is allowed under Section 409A.
The following general rules shall apply for purposes of interpreting the provisions of this Article VI.
    (a)    Section 6.02 (Distributions Based on a Specific Payment Date) applies when a Participant has elected to defer
until a Specific Payment Date and the Specific Payment Date is reached before the Participant’ s (i) Separation from Service
(other than for Retirement), (ii) Disability , or (iii) death. However , if such a Participant Separates from Service (other than for
Retirement or death) prior to the Specific Payment Date (or prior to processing of the first installment or Second Look Election
payment due in connection with the Specific Payment Date), Section 6.03 shall apply . If such a Participant dies prior to the
Specific Payment Date, Section 6.04 shall apply to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a
Participant’ s Account. If such a Participant becomes Disabled prior to the Specific Payment Date, Section 6.06 shall apply to the
extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
    (b)    Section 6.03 (Distributions on Account of a Separation from Service) applies (i) when a Participant has elected to
defer until a Separation from Service and then the Participant Separates from Service (other than for Retirement or death), or (ii)
when applicable under Subsection (a) above.
    (c)    Section 6.04 (Distributions on Account of Death) applies when a Participant dies. If a Participant is entitled to
receive or is receiving a distribution under Section 6.02, 6.03 or 6.05 at the time of his death, Section 6.04 shall take precedence
over those sections to the extent Section 6.04 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
    (d)    Section 6.05 (Distributions on Account of Retirement) applies when a Participant has elected to defer until a
Separation from Service and then the Participant Separates from Service on account of his or her Retirement. Subsections (c) and
(e) of this Section provide for when Section 6.04 or 6.06 take precedence over Section 6.05.
    (e)    Section 6.06 (Distributions on Account of Disability) applies when a Participant becomes Disabled. If a
Participant who becomes Disabled dies, Section 6.04 shall take precedence over Section 6.06 to the extent it would result in an
earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account. If a Participant is entitled to receive or is receiving a distribution
under Section 6.02, 6.03 or 6.05 at the time of his Disability , Section 6.06 shall take precedence over those sections to the extent
Section 6.06 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
    (f)    Section 6.07 (Distributions on Account of Unforeseeable Emer gency) applies when a Participant incurs an
Unforeseeable Emer gency prior to when a Participant’ s Account is distributed under Sections 6.02 through 6.06. In this case, the
provisions of Section
23
6.07 shall take precedence over Sections 6.02 through 6.06 to the extent Section 6.07 would result in an earlier distribution of all
or part of a Participant’ s Account.
6.02    Distributions Based on a Specific Payment Date:
    This Section shall apply to distributions that are to be made upon the occurrence of a Specific Payment Date. In the event a
Participant’ s Specific Payment Date for a Deferral Subaccount is reached before (i) the Participant’ s Disability , (ii) the
Participant’ s Separation from Service (other than for Retirement), or (iii) the Participant’ s death, such Deferral Subaccount shall
be distributed based on the occurrence of such Specific Payment Date in accordance with the following terms and conditions:
        (a)    If a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the form of a lump sum pursuant to Section 4.04 or 4.05,
whichever is applicable, the Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the last Distribution V aluation Date that occurs on or
immediately precedes the Participant’ s Specific Payment Date, and the resulting amount shall be paid in a single lump sum on the
Specific Payment Date.
        (b)    This subsection shall be ef fective for Specific Payment Dates and Separations from Service occurring from and after
January 1, 2009. If a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the form of installments pursuant to Section 4.04 or 4.05,
whichever is applicable, the Participant’ s first installment payment shall be paid on the Specific Payment Date. Thereafter ,
installment payments shall continue in accordance with the schedule elected by the Participant (subject to the provisions of this
Plan that constrain such elections), except as provided in Sections 6.03, 6.04, 6.06 and 6.07 (relating to distributions upon
Separation from Service (other than Retirement), death, Disability or Unforeseeable Emer gency). The amount of each installment
shall be determined under Section 6.08. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, if before the date the last
installment distribution is processed for payment the Participant Separates from Service (other than Retirement) or the Participant
would be entitled to a distribution in accordance with Section 6.04 or 6.06 (relating to distributions on account of death or
Disability), the remaining balance of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts that would otherwise be distributed based on such
Specific Payment Date shall instead be distributed in accordance with Section 6.03, 6.04 or 6.06 (relating to distributions on
account of Separation from Service (other than Retirement), death or Disability), whichever applies, but only to the extent it
would result in an earlier distribution of the Participant’ s Subaccounts in the case of Section 6.04 or Section 6.06.
6.03    Distributions on Account of a Separation from Service:
    A Participant’ s total Account shall be distributed upon the occurrence of a Participant’ s Separation from Service (other than for
Retirement, Disability or death) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section. When used in this Section, the
phrase “Separation from Service” shall only refer to a Separation from Service that is not for Retirement, Disability or death. The
rules of this Section shall be ef fective for Specific Payment Dates and Separations from Service occurring from and after January
1, 2009.
        (a)    Subject to Subsection (c), for those Deferral Subaccounts that have a Specific Payment Date that is after the
Participant’ s Separation from Service, such Deferral Subaccounts shall be distributed in a single lump sum payment on the first
day of the calendar quarter that follows the Participant’ s Separation from Service.
        (b)    Subject to Subsection (c), if the Participant’ s Separation from Service is on or after the Specific Payment Date
(including a Specific Payment Date resulting from a Second Look Election) applicable to a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount and
the Participant has
24
selected installment payments as the form of distribution for the Deferral Subaccount, then such Deferral Subaccount shall be
distributed as follows:
        (1)     If the first installment payment has been processed prior to the Participant’ s Separation from
Service, then the Participant’ s remaining installment payment election shall be void and the Participant shall be paid a
single lump sum distribution for the remaining balance of the Deferral Subaccount based upon the provisions of Subsection
(a) above; and
 
(2)     If the first installment payment has not yet been processed prior to the Participant’ s
Separation from Service, then the Participant’ s entire installment payment election shall be void and the Participant shall
be paid a single lump sum distribution for the Deferral Subaccount based upon the provisions of Subsection (a) above.
(c)    If the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the time of the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or
at such other time for determining Key Employee status as may apply under Section 409A), then such Participant’ s Account shall
not be paid, as a result of the Participant’ s Separation from Service, earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter that is at least
6 months after the Participant’ s Separation from Service.
(d)    If a Participant has Separated from Service, the Participant’ s entire Account balance has been distributed
under this Article VI as a result of such Separation from Service, and later the Participant’ s Account is credited with a deferral of
compensation that was not available for credit before the time the Participant’ s Account was previously paid out ( e.g., Bonus
Compensation), then the new balance of such Participant’ s Account shall be distributed as a result of such prior Separation from
Service and the distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment on the first day of the calendar quarter that follows the
date that the deferral was credited to the Participant’ s Account, subject however to the rules of Subsection (c).
6.04    Distributions on Account of Death:
        (a)    Upon a Participant’ s death, the value of the Participant’ s Account under the Plan shall be distributed in a single lump
sum payment on the first day of the calendar quarter beginning after the first anniversary of the Participant’ s death. Effective
January 1, 2019 and notwithstanding the preceding sentence, upon a Participant’ s death, the value of the Participant’ s Account
under the Plan shall be distributed in a single lump sum payment during the period that (i) begins on the first day of the calendar
quarter beginning after the Participant’ s death, and (ii) ends on December 31 of the year following the year of death. If the
Participant is receiving installment payments at the time of the Participant’ s death, such installment payments shall continue in
accordance with the terms of the applicable deferral election that governs such payments until the time that the lump sum
payment is due to be paid under the applicable preceding sentence of this subsection. Immediately prior to the time that such
lump sum payment is scheduled to be paid, all installment payments shall cease and the remaining balance of the Participant’ s
Account shall be distributed at such payment time in a single lump sum. Amounts paid following a Participant’ s death, whether a
lump sum or continued installments, shall be paid to the Participant’ s Beneficiary . If some but not all of the persons designated by
a Participant as Beneficiaries to receive his or her Account at death predecease the Participant, the Participant’ s surviving
Beneficiaries shall be entitled to the portion of the Participant’ s Account intended for such pre-deceased persons in proportion to
the surviving Beneficiaries’ respective shares.
        (b)    If no Participant designation is in ef fect at the time of a Participant’ s death (as determined by the Plan Administrator)
or if all persons designated as Beneficiaries by the
25
Participant have predeceased the Participant, then the payments to be made pursuant to this Section shall be distributed as
follows:
        (1)    If the Participant is married (or for deaths on and after January 1, 2019, in a domestic partnership) at the time of
his/her death, all payments made pursuant to this Section shall be paid to the Participant’ s surviving spouse or surviving
eligible domestic partner; and
(2) If the Participant is not married (or for deaths on and after January 1, 2019, in a domestic
partnership) at the time of his/her death, all payments made pursuant to this Section shall be paid to the Participant’ s
surviving children in equal shares.
(3) If the Participant is not married (or for deaths on and after January 1, 2019, in a domestic
partnership) and does not have any living children at the time of his/her death, all payments made pursuant to this Section
shall be paid to the Participant’ s estate.
The Plan Administrator shall determine whether a Participant is “married” and shall determine a Participant’ s “spouse” based on
the state or local law where the Participant has his/her primary residence at the time of death. For these purposes, an “eligible
domestic partner” means the individual, (i) with whom the Participant was in a valid civil union under state law at the time of the
Participant’ s death, (ii) who would satisfy the criteria to be enrolled in the Company’ s health benefits as the Participant’ s
domestic partner at the time of the Participant’ s death or (iii) who satisfies such other criteria of domestic partnership as the Plan
Administrator has specified in writing. The Plan Administrator is authorized to make any applicable inquires and to request any
documents, certificates or other information that it deems necessary or appropriate in order to make the above determinations.
        (c)    Prior to the time the value of the Participant’ s Account is distributed under Subsection (a), the Participant’ s Beneficiary
may apply for a distribution under Section 6.07 (relating to a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency).
        (d)    Any claim to be paid any amounts standing to the credit of a Participant in connection with the Participant’ s death must
be received by the Recordkeeper or the Plan Administrator at least 14 days before any such amount is paid out by the
Recordkeeper . Any claim received thereafter is untimely , and it shall be unenforceable against the Plan, the Company , the Plan
Administrator , the Recordkeeper or any other party acting for one or more of them.
6.05    Distributions on Account of Retirement:
    If a Participant incurs a Separation from Service on account of his or her Retirement, the Participant’ s Account shall be
distributed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section.
        (a)    If the Participant’ s Retirement is prior to the Specific Payment Date that is applicable to a Deferral Subaccount, the
Participant’ s deferral election pursuant to Sections 4.03, 4.04 or 4.05 ( i.e., time and form of payment) shall continue to be given
effect, and the Deferral Subaccount shall be distributed based upon the provisions of Subsections (a) and (b) under Section 6.02,
whichever applies (relating to distributions based on a Specific Payment Date).
        (b)    If the Participant has selected payment of his or her deferral on account of Separation from Service, distribution of the
related Deferral Subaccount shall commence on the
26
first day of the calendar quarter following Retirement. Such distribution shall be made in either a single lump sum payment or in
installment payments depending upon the Participant’ s deferral election under Sections 4.04 or 4.05. If the Participant is entitled
to installment payments, such payments shall be made in accordance with the Participant’ s installment election (but subject to
acceleration under Sections 6.04, 6.06 and 6.07 relating to distributions on account of death, Disability and Unforeseeable
Emer gency) and with the installment payment amounts determined under Section 6.08. However , if the Participant is classified as
a Key Employee at the time of the Participant’ s Retirement (or at such other time for determining Key Employee status as may
apply under Section 409A), then such Participant’ s Account shall not be paid, as a result of the Participant’ s Retirement, earlier
than the first day of the calendar quarter that is at least 6 months after the Participant’ s Retirement.
        (c)    If the Participant is receiving installment payments in accordance with Section 6.02 (relating to distributions on
account of a Specific Payment Date) for one or more Deferral Subaccounts at the time of his or her Retirement, such installment
payments shall continue to be paid based upon the Participant’ s deferral election (but subject to acceleration under Sections 6.04,
6.06 and 6.07 relating to distributions on account of death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency).
        
6.06    Distributions on Account of Disability:
    If a Participant incurs a Disability , the Participant’ s Account shall be distributed in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Section.
        (a)    The value of the Participant’ s Account under the Plan as of the most recent Distribution V aluation Date shall be
distributed in a single lump sum payment on the first date (i) on which the Participant is Disabled (determined without regard to
the duration requirement of the next clause), (ii) that is at least 12 months following the first date the Participant was Disabled
from the cause of the current Disability , and (iii) that is after the Participant has received payments from a PepsiCo disability plan
(including the PepsiCo Disability Plan) for the current cause of Disability (determined without regard to the duration requirement
of this clause).
(b)    If the Participant is receiving installment payments at the time of the Participant’ s Disability , such installment
payments shall continue to be paid in accordance with the provisions of the Participant’ s applicable deferral election until the
time that the lump sum payment is due to be paid under the provisions of Subsection (a). Immediately prior to the time that such
lump sum payment is scheduled to be paid, all installment payments shall cease and the remaining balance of the Participant’ s
Account shall be distributed at the time specified in Subsection (a) in a single lump sum.
6.07    Distributions on Account of Unforeseeable Emergency:
    Prior to the time that an amount would become distributable under Sections 6.02 through 6.06, a Participant or Beneficiary
may file a written request with the Recordkeeper for accelerated payment of all or a portion of the amount credited to the
Participant’ s Account based upon an Unforeseeable Emer gency . After an individual has filed a written request pursuant to this
Section, along with all supporting material that may be required by the Recordkeeper from time to time, the Recordkeeper shall
determine within 60 days (or such other number of days that is necessary if special circumstances warrant additional time)
whether the individual meets the criteria for an Unforeseeable Emer gency . If the Recordkeeper determines that an Unforeseeable
Emer gency has occurred, the Participant or Beneficiary shall receive a distribution from his or her Account as of the day the
Recordkeeper finalizes the determination. However , such distribution shall not exceed the dollar amount necessary to satisfy the
Unforeseeable Emer gency
27
(plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution) after taking into account the extent to
which the Unforeseeable Emer gency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or
by liquidation of the Participant’ s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial
hardship).
6.08    Valuation:
    In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article, the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount shall
continue to be credited with earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and losses) as specified in Article V until the
Distribution V aluation Date that is used in determining the amount of the distribution under this Article. If a particular Section in
this Article does not specify a Distribution V aluation Date to be used in calculating the distribution, the Participant’ s Deferral
Subaccount shall continue to be credited with earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and losses) as specified in Article V
until the Distribution V aluation Date that precedes such distribution. In determining the value of a Participant’ s remaining
Deferral Subaccount following an installment distribution from the Deferral Subaccount (or a partial distribution under Section
6.07 relating to a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency), such distribution shall reduce the value of the
Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount as of the close of the Distribution V aluation Date preceding the payment date for such
installment (or partial distribution). The amount to be distributed in connection with any installment payment (other than a fixed
amount elected under Section 4.04) shall be determined by dividing the value of a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount as of such
preceding Distribution V aluation Date (determined before reduction of the Deferral Subaccount as of such Distribution V aluation
Date in accordance with the preceding sentence) by the remaining number of installments to be paid with respect to the Deferral
Subaccount. The amount distributed in connection with a fixed dollar amount installment election shall be equal to the dollar
amount elected and subject to the rules in Section 4.04.
6.09    Section 162(m) Compliance:
    Notwithstanding Sections 6.01 through 6.07 of this Article, Plan distributions may be delayed in accordance with the special
rule in T reas. Reg. §1.409A-2(b)(7)(i) (the “162(m) Provision”). The 162(m) Provision’ s special rule permits distributions to be
delayed to the extent the Employer reasonably anticipates that, if the distribution were made as otherwise scheduled, the
Employer ’s deduction for the distribution would not be permitted as a result of Code Section 162(m). Use of the 162(m)
Provision’ s special rule is subject to conditions, including:
(a)     The Employer must treat all similarly situated employees on a reasonably consistent basis,
(b)     If the Employer delays a Plan distribution under the 162(m) Provision, the Employer must delay all
payments of deferred compensation to a Participant (including payments under other arrangements) that (i) could be delayed
under the 162(m) Provision, and (ii) are scheduled to be paid to the Participant in the same tax year in which the delayed
distribution was scheduled to be paid, and
(c)    Distribution must be made in accordance with the schedule specified in the 162(m) Provision (including any
applicable six-month delay) once a distribution would be deductible taking into account Code Section 162(m).
28
6.10    Impact of Section 16 of the Act on Distributions:
    The provisions of Sections 5.03(c) and 7.06 shall apply in determining whether a Participant’ s distribution shall be delayed
beyond the date applicable under the preceding provisions of this Article VI.
6.11    Actual Payment Date:
    An amount payable on a date specified in this Article VI shall be paid no later than the later of (a) the end of the calendar year
in which the specified date occurs, or (b) the 15  day of the third calendar month following such specified date. In addition, the
Participant (or Beneficiary) is not permitted to designate the taxable year of the payment.th

ARTICLE VII– PLAN ADMINISTRATION
7.01    Plan Administrator:
The Plan Administrator is responsible for the administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator has the authority to name
one or more delegates to carry out certain responsibilities hereunder , as specified in the definition of Plan Administrator . Any
such delegation shall state the scope of responsibilities being delegated and is subject to Section 7.06 below .
7.02    Action:
Action by the Plan Administrator may be taken in accordance with procedures that the Plan Administrator adopts from
time to time or that the Company’ s Law Department determines are legally permissible.
7.03    Powers of the Plan Administrator:
The Plan Administrator shall administer and manage the Plan and shall have (and shall be permitted to delegate) all
powers necessary to accomplish that purpose, including the following:
        (a)    To exercise its discretionary authority to construe, interpret, and administer this Plan;
        (b)    To exercise its discretionary authority to make all decisions regarding eligibility , participation and deferrals, to make
allocations and determinations required by this Plan, and to maintain records regarding Participants’ Accounts;
        (c)    To compute and certify to the Employers the amount and kinds of payments to Participants or their Beneficiaries, and
to determine the time and manner in which such payments are to be paid;
        (d)    To authorize all disbursements by the Employer pursuant to this Plan;
        (e)    To maintain (or cause to be maintained) all the necessary records for administration of this Plan;
        (f)    To make and publish such rules for the regulation of this Plan as are not inconsistent with the terms hereof;
        (g)    To delegate to other individuals or entities from time to time the performance of any of its duties or responsibilities
hereunder;
        (h)    To establish or to change the phantom investment options or arrangements under Article V ;
        (i)    To hire agents, accountants, actuaries, consultants and legal counsel to assist in operating and administering the Plan;
and
        (j)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan except Section 7.07 (relating to compliance with Section 409A), the
Plan Administrator or the Recordkeeper may take any action the Plan Administrator deems is necessary to assure compliance
with any policy of the Company respecting insider trading as may be in ef fect from time to time. Such actions may include
altering the ef fective date of intra-fund transfers or the distribution date of Deferral
30
Subaccounts. Any such actions shall alter the normal operation of the Plan to the minimum extent necessary .
    The Plan Administrator has the exclusive and discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all
questions of eligibility for benefits, to determine the amount and manner of payment of such benefits and to make any
determinations that are contemplated by (or permissible under) the terms of this Plan, and its decisions on such matters will be
final and conclusive on all parties. Any such decision or determination shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted discretion
of the Plan Administrator , even if (1) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or (2) a
determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions expressly
grant discretion or call for a determination. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator
decides in its discretion that the applicant is entitled to them. All decisions and determinations made by the Plan Administrator
will be final, conclusive, and binding on all parties. The Plan Administrator may consider the intent of the Company with respect
to a Plan provision in making any determination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the provisions set forth in any
document that ar guably do not contemplate considering such intent. The Plan Administrator ’s discretion is absolute, and in any
case where the breadth of the Plan Administrator ’s discretion is at issue, it is expressly intended that the Plan Administrator (or
its delegate) be accorded the maximum possible discretion. Any exercise by the Plan Administrator of its discretionary authority
shall be reviewed by a court under the arbitrary and capricious standard (i.e., abuse of discretion).
7.04    Compensation, Indemnity and Liability:
The Plan Administrator will serve without bond and without compensation for services hereunder . All expenses of the
Plan and the Plan Administrator will be paid by the Employers. To the extent deemed appropriate by the Plan Administrator , any
such expense may be char ged against specific Participant Accounts, thereby reducing the obligation of the Employers. No
member of the Committee (which serves as the Plan Administrator), and no individual acting as the delegate of the Committee,
shall be liable for any act or omission of any other member or individual, nor for any act or omission on his or her own part,
excepting his or her own willful misconduct. The Employers (other than the Company) will indemnify and hold harmless each
member of the Committee and any employee of the Company (or a Company af filiate, if recognized as an af filiate for this
purpose by the Plan Administrator) acting as the delegate of the Committee against any and all expenses and liabilities, including
reasonable legal fees and expenses, arising in connection with this Plan out of his or her membership on the Committee (or his or
her serving as the delegate of the Committee).
7.05    Withholding:
 
The Employer shall withhold from amounts due under this Plan, any amount necessary to enable the Employer to remit to
the appropriate government entity or entities on behalf of the Participant as may be required by the federal income tax provisions
of the Code, by an applicable state’ s income tax provisions, and by an applicable city , county or municipality’ s earnings or
income tax provisions. Further , the Employer shall withhold from the payroll of, or collect from, a Participant the amount
necessary to remit on behalf of the Participant any Social Security or Medicare taxes which may be required with respect to
amounts deferred or accrued by a Participant hereunder , as determined by the Employer . In addition, to the extent required by
Section 409A, amounts deferred under this Plan shall be reported on each Participant’ s Form W -2 for the applicable tax year , and
any amounts that become taxable hereunder shall be reported as taxable wages on the Participant’ s Form W -2 for the applicable
tax year . All such reporting shall be performed based on the rules and procedures of Section 409A.
31
7.06    Section 16 Compliance:
        (a)    In General . This Plan is intended to be a formula plan for purposes of Section 16 of the Act. Accordingly , in the case of
a deferral or other action under the Plan that constitutes a transaction that could be covered by Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), if it were
approved by the Company’ s Board or Compensation Committee (“Board Approval”), it is intended that the Plan shall be
administered by delegates of the Compensation Committee, in the case of a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act, in
a manner that will permit the Board Approval of the Plan to avoid any additional Board Approval of specific transactions to the
maximum possible extent.
        (b)    Approval of Distributions : This subsection shall govern the distribution of a deferral that (i) is wholly or partly
invested in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund at the time the deferral would be valued to determine the amount of cash
to be distributed to a Participant, (ii) either was the subject of a Second Look Election or was not covered by an agreement, made
at the time of the Participant’ s original deferral election, that any investments in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund
would, once made, remain in that fund until distribution of the deferral, (iii) is made to a Participant who is subject to Section 16
of the Act at the time the interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund would be liquidated in connection with the
distribution, and (iv) if paid at the time the distribution would be made without regard to this subsection, could result in a
violation of Section 16 of the Act because there is an opposite way transaction that would be matched with the liquidation of the
Participant’ s interest in the PepsiCo Common Stock Fund (either as a “discretionary transaction,” within the meaning of Rule
16b-3(b)(1), or as a regular transaction, as applicable) (a “Covered Distribution”). In the case of a Covered Distribution, if the
liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the distribution has not
received Board Approval by the time the distribution would be made if it were not a Covered Distribution, or if it is a
discretionary transaction, then the actual distribution to the Participant shall be delayed only until the earlier of:
        (1)    In the case of a transaction that is not a discretionary transaction, Board Approval of the liquidation of the
Participant’ s interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the distribution, and
        (2)    The date the distribution would no longer violate Section 16 of the Act, e.g., when the Participant is no longer
subject to Section 16 of the Act, when the Deferral Subaccount related to the distribution is no longer invested in the
Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund or when the time between the liquidation and an opposite way transaction is
sufficient.
7.07    Conformance with Section 409A:
    Ef fective from and after January 1, 2009, at all times during each Plan Y ear, this Plan shall be operated (i) in accordance with
the requirements of Section 409A, and (ii) to preserve the status of deferrals under the Pre-409A Program as being exempt from
Section 409A, i.e., to preserve the grandfathered status of the Pre-409A Program. In all cases, the provisions of this Section shall
apply notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan that is not contained in this Section.
32
ARTICLE VIII – CLAIMS PROCEDURE
8.01    Claims for Benefits:
    The Plan Administrator has the discretionary right to modify the claims process described in this Section in any manner so
long as the claims review process, as modified, includes the basic steps described in this Section and Section 8.02. If a
Participant, putative Participant, Beneficiary , putative Beneficiary or other person (hereafter , “Claimant”) does not receive timely
payment of any benefits which he or she believes are due and payable under the Plan, or if a Claimant believes some other right
derived from or related to the Plan has been withheld or abridged, he or she may make a claim for benefits to the Plan
Administrator . The claim for benefits must be in writing (or in such other form acceptable to the Plan Administrator) and
addressed to the Plan Administrator . If the claim for benefits is denied, the Plan Administrator will notify the Claimant within 90
days after the Plan Administrator initially received the benefit claim. However , if special circumstances require an extension of
time for processing the claim, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to the Claimant prior to the termination
of the initial 90-day period (indicating the special circumstances that require the extension), and such extension may not exceed
one additional, consecutive 90-day period. Any notice of a denial of benefits shall advise the Claimant of the basis for the denial,
pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based, any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to
perfect his or her claim, and the steps which the Claimant must take to appeal his or her claim for benefits.
8.02    Appeals of Denied Claims:
    Each Claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied may file a written appeal for a review of his or her claim by the Plan
Administrator . The request for review must be filed by the Claimant within 60 days after he or she received the notice denying
his or her claim. Upon review , the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim, including the
opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments, document, records and other information relevant to the claim, and
the Plan Administrator ’s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of
whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision of the Plan Administrator will be communicated
to the Claimant within 60 days after receipt of a request for appeal. The notice shall set forth the basis for the Plan
Administrator ’s decision. However , if special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the appeal, the Plan
Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to the Claimant prior to the termination of the initial 60-day period (indicating
the special circumstances that require the extension), and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 60-day
period. In no event shall the Plan Administrator ’s decision be rendered later than 120 days after receipt of a request for appeal.
Effective March 1, 2020 and continuing at least through November 1, 2022, the Department of Labor , the Department of
the T reasury , and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (collectively the “Agencies”) extended certain deadlines applicable to the
Plan in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, pursuant to the authority granted in ERISA section 518 and Code section 7508A(b) and
as set forth in Disaster Relief Notices 2020-01 and 2021-01 issued by the Employee Benefits Security Administration (“EBSA”),
and the Notice of Extension of Certain T imeframes for Employee Benefit Plans, Participants, and Beneficiaries Af fected by the
COVID–19 Outbreak issued by the Agencies. The Plan will comply with these extensions as required by applicable law and
Agency guidance. Specifically , the Agencies provided that a period of up to one year may be disregarded in the case of an
employee benefit plan, sponsor , administrator , participant, beneficiary , or other person with respect to the employee benefit plan
in determining the date by which any action is required or permitted to be completed as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak. This
relief ends on the earlier of (a) 1 year from the date a person was
33
first eligible for the relief, or (b) 60 days after the announced end of the National Emer gency (the end of the Outbreak Period),
which is still on-going as of November 1, 2022. In no case will a disregarded period exceed 1 year . This relief includes but is not
limited to notices and disclosures required by the Plan, and the deadlines under the ERISA claims procedure.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis
of the record before the Plan Administrator at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be
conditioned on the Claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this section as is more fully explained in Section 7.5. Any
notice or other notification that is required to be sent to a claimant under this section may be sent pursuant to any method
approved under Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1 or other applicable guidance.
8.03    Special Claims Procedures for Disability Determinations:
    Notwithstanding Sections 8.01 and 8.02, if the claim or appeal of the Claimant relates to Disability benefits, such claim or
appeal shall be processed pursuant to the applicable provisions of Department of Labor Regulation Section 2560.503-1 relating to
Disability benefits, including Sections 2560.503-1(d), 2560.503-1(f)(3), 2560.503-1(h)(4) and 2560.503-1(i)(3).
8.04    Effect of Specific References:
Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator ’s discretion shall create no inference that the Plan
Administrator ’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.
8.05    Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court:
Before filing any Claim (including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully
exhaust all of the Claimant’ s rights under the claims procedures of this Article.
(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 8.05 is intended to be
interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary to clarify or ef fect this intent may
be taken). For example, exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a Claim unless the purported claimant took
sufficient steps to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that the purported claimant was submitting a Claim with
respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for documents unless (A) ERISA requires the documents to be provided in
response to the request, (B) the Claimant requests such documents in a writing that is addressed to and actually received by the
Plan Administrator , (C) the Plan Administrator fails to provide the requested documents within 6 months after the date the
request is received, or within such longer period as may be reasonable under the facts and circumstances, and (D) the requestor
took suf ficient steps to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that the requestor was asserting an ERISA right to the
documents. Accordingly , without limitation, a purported claimant or requestor who was not treated as a Participant shall not be
deemed to have taken suf ficient steps for purposes of the prior sentence unless he makes it reasonably clear to the Plan
Administrator that he is claiming to have been entitled to be a Participant.
(b)    In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion of the Plan’ s
claims procedure as described in this Section 8.05, the subsequent action or consideration shall be limited, to the maximum extent
permissible, to the record that was before Plan Administrator in the claims procedure.
34
(c)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 8.05 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other Disputes that are
not Claims (including those that a court might consider at the same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights
the Plan Administrator may choose to provide in connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of
whether the rights are actual or potential and (iv) even if the Plan Administrator has not previously defined or established specific
claims procedures that directly apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the Plan Administrator
(upon notice of the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act by analogy to) the claims
procedures of Section 8.05 that apply to claims for benefits).
(d)    The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis or to address
unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be made as are necessary to maximize the
extent to which exhaustion is required.
(e)    For purposes of this Section 8.05, the following definitions apply .
(1)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, assertion, action or other matter .
(2)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of the following –
(A)    The interpretation of the Plan;
(B)    The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan;
(C)    The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light of applicable law;
(D)    Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been validly adopted or put into
effect;
(E)    The administration of the Plan;
(F)    Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms, conditions or requirements of
ERISA or other applicable law or regulation, regardless of whether such terms, conditions or requirements are, in
whole or in part, incorporated into the terms, conditions or requirements of the Plan;
(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;
(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any fiduciary duty; or
(I)    Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the Plan Administrator , or (ii)
relates to the Plan in any way .
It is the Plan Administrator ’s intent to interpret and operate the Plan in good faith and at all times consistently with any
applicable requirements of ERISA. Therefore, as a condition for any right or recovery related to the Plan, the Plan
imposes a contractual obligation for complete exhaustion under this Section with respect to any Claim (as defined above)
in order to allow for the ef ficient and uniform resolution of such Claims and to protect the Plan from potentially
substantial and unnecessary litigation expenses that exhaustion could obviate.
(3)    A “Claimant” is any actual or putative Employee, former Employee, Participant, former Participant,
Beneficiary (or the spouse, former spouse, estate, heir or representative of any of the foregoing individuals), or any other
individual, person, entity with a relationship to any of the foregoing individuals or the Plan, as well as any group of one or
more of the foregoing, who has a Claim.
35
8.06    Limitations on Actions:
Effective for claims and actions filed on or after April 1, 2016, any claim filed under Article VIII and any action
filed in state or federal court by or on behalf of a former or current Employee, Participant, beneficiary or any other individual,
person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits or for the alleged interference with
or violation of ERISA-protected rights must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues.
For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue
not later than the earliest of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or
legal action (ii) the date identified to the Petitioner by the Plan Administrator on which payments shall commence, or (iii) when
the Petitioner has actual or constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. For purposes of this subsection, a
cause of action with respect to the alleged interference with ERISA-protected rights shall be deemed to accrue when the claimant
has actual or constructive knowledge of the acts that are alleged to interfere with ERISA-protected rights. Failure to bring any
such claim or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner ,
from filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals process
described in this Article shall have no ef fect on this two-year time frame.
8.07    Restriction on Venue:
Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner (as
defined in Section 8.06 above) shall only be brought or filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York, ef fective for claims or actions filed on or after January 1, 2019.
36
ARTICLE IX– AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
9.01    Amendment of Plan:
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company , or its delegate or delegates, has the right in its
sole discretion to amend this Plan in whole or in part at any time and in any manner , including the manner of making deferral
elections, the terms on which distributions are made, and the form and timing of distributions. However , except for mere
clarifying amendments necessary to avoid an inappropriate windfall, no Plan amendment shall reduce the amount credited to the
Account of any Participant as of the date such amendment is adopted. As of September 25, 2019, the Company’ s Executive V ice
President and Chief Human Resources Of ficer (or if such position is vacant or eliminated, the person who is acting to fulfill the
majority of the duties of the position (or plurality of the duties if no one is fulfilling a majority) as such duties existed
immediately prior to the vacancy or the position elimination) is delegated the responsibility to amend the Plan at any time and in
any manner , except with respect to those provisions of the Plan which relate to matters subject to Section 7.06. Any amendment
shall be in writing and adopted by the Committee or its delegate or delegates. All Participants and Beneficiaries shall be bound by
such amendment. Any amendments made to the Plan shall be subject to any restrictions on amendment that are applicable to
ensure continued compliance under Section 409A.
9.02    Termination of Plan:
    (a)    The Company expects to continue this Plan, but does not obligate itself to do so. The Company , acting by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or through its entire Board of Directors, reserves the right to discontinue and
terminate the Plan at any time, in whole or in part, for any reason (including a change, or an impending change, in the tax laws of
the United States or any State). Termination of the Plan will be binding on all Participants (and a partial termination shall be
binding upon all af fected Participants) and their Beneficiaries, but in no event may such termination reduce the amounts credited
at that time to any Participant’ s Account. If this Plan is terminated (in whole or in part), the termination resolution shall provide
for how amounts theretofore credited to af fected Participants’ Accounts will be distributed.
    (b)    This Section is subject to the same restrictions related to compliance with Section 409A that apply to Section
9.01. In accordance with these restrictions, the Company intends to have the maximum discretionary authority to terminate the
Plan and make distributions in connection with a Change in Control (as defined in Section 409A), and the maximum flexibility
with respect to how and to what extent to carry this out following a Change in Control (as defined in Section 409A) as is
permissible under Section 409A. The previous sentence contains the exclusive terms under which a distribution may be made in
connection with any change in control with respect to deferrals made under this 409A Program.
37
ARTICLE X – MISCELLANEOUS
10.01    Limitation on Participant’s Rights:
Participation in this Plan does not give any Participant the right to be retained in the Employer ’s employ (or any right or
interest in this Plan or any assets of the Employer other than as herein provided). The Employer reserves the right to terminate the
employment of any Participant without any liability for any claim against the Employer under this Plan, except for a claim for
payment of deferrals as provided herein.
10.02    Unfunded Obligation of Individual Employer:
    (a)    The benefits provided by this Plan are unfunded. All amounts payable under this Plan to Participants are paid from
the general assets of the Participant’ s individual Employer . Nothing contained in this Plan requires an Employer to set aside or
hold in trust any amounts or assets for the purpose of paying benefits to Participants. Neither a Participant, Beneficiary , nor any
other person shall have any property interest, legal or equitable, in any specific Employer asset. This Plan creates only a
contractual obligation on the part of a Participant’ s individual Employer , and the Participant has the status of a general unsecured
creditor of this Employer with respect to amounts of compensation deferred hereunder . Such a Participant shall not have any
preference or priority over the rights of any other unsecured general creditor of the Employer . No other Employer guarantees or
shares such obligation, and no other Employer shall have any liability to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary . In the event a
Participant transfers from the employment of one Employer to another , the former Employer shall transfer the liability for
deferrals made while the Participant was employed by that Employer to the new Employer (and the books of both Employers
shall be adjusted appropriately).
    (b)    Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (a), for purposes of this Section an “Employer” shall only refer to
those entities which are part of the PepsiCo Or ganization. If a Participant transfers to an entity that is not part of the PepsiCo
Organization, the liability for deferrals made while the Participant was employed by the PepsiCo Or ganization shall remain with
his or her last Employer that was part of the PepsiCo Or ganization.
10.03    Other Plans:
This Plan shall not af fect the right of any Eligible Executive or Participant to participate in and receive benefits under and
in accordance with the provisions of any other employee benefit plans which are now or hereafter maintained by any Employer ,
unless the terms of such other employee benefit plan or plans specifically provide otherwise or it would cause such other plan to
violate a requirement for tax favored treatment.
10.04    Receipt or Release:
Any payment to a Participant in accordance with the provisions of this Plan shall, to the extent thereof, be in full
satisfaction of all claims against the Plan Administrator , the Recordkeeper , the Company , and all Employers, and the Plan
Administrator may require such Participant, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and release to such
effect.
10.05    Governing Law:
This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in all respects in accordance with applicable federal law and, to
the extent not preempted by federal law , in accordance with
38
the laws of the State of New Y ork. If any provisions of this instrument shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof shall continue to be fully ef fective.
10.06    Adoption of Plan by Related Employers:
The Plan Administrator may select as an Employer (other than the Company , which is automatically an Employer
hereunder) any division of the Company , as well as any subsidiary or af filiate related to the Company by ownership (and that is a
member of the PepsiCo Or ganization), and permit or cause such division, subsidiary or af filiate to adopt the Plan. The selection
by the Plan Administrator shall govern the ef fective date of the adoption of the Plan by such related Employer . The requirements
for Plan adoption are entirely within the discretion of the Plan Administrator and, in any case where the status of an entity as an
Employer is at issue, the determination of the Plan Administrator shall be absolutely conclusive.
10.07    Gender, Tense and Examples:
In this Plan, whenever the context so indicates, the singular or plural number and the masculine, feminine, or neuter
gender shall be deemed to include the other . Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by
a specific item or items, or there is a passage having a similar ef fect, such passage of the Plan shall be construed as if the phrase
“without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limitation on
its breadth of application).
10.08    Successors and Assigns; Nonalienation of Benefits:
This Plan inures to the benefit of and is binding upon the parties hereto and their successors, heirs and assigns; provided,
however , that the amounts credited to the Account of a Participant are not (except as provided in Sections 5.06 and 7.05) subject
in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer , assignment, pledge, encumbrance, char ge, garnishment, execution or levy
of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary , and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer , assign, pledge, encumber ,
charge or otherwise dispose of any right to any benefits payable hereunder , including, without limitation, any assignment or
alienation in connection with a separation, divorce, child support or similar arrangement, will be null and void and not binding on
the Plan or the Company or any Employer . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator reserves the right to make
payments in accordance with a divorce decree, judgment or other court order as and when cash payments are made in accordance
with the terms of this Plan from the Deferral Subaccount of a Participant. Any such payment shall be char ged against and reduce
the Participant’ s Account.
10.09    Facility of Payment:
Whenever , in the Plan Administrator ’s opinion, a Participant or Beneficiary entitled to receive any payment hereunder is
under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his or her financial af fairs, the Plan
Administrator may direct the Employer to make payments to such person or to the legal representative of such person for his or
her benefit, or to apply the payment for the benefit of such person in such manner as the Plan Administrator considers advisable.
Any payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall be a complete dischar ge of any liability for the making of
such payment to the Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan.
