 FIRST QUARTER 2023 SEGMENT COMMENTARY:  
Adjusted operational sales* reflected below excludes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and 
translational currency.  
 
Consumer Health 
Consumer Health worldwide adjusted operational sales increased 11.3%* largely driven by over-the-counter (OTC) 
products.  Major contributors to growth in OTC were TYLENOL and MOTRIN analgesics, upper respiratory products, 
IMODIUM in digestive health products and international smoking cessation products.  Additional contributors to 
growth were NEUTROGENA and AVEENO in Skin Health/Beauty products and JOHNSON’s in Baby Care products.  
 
Pharmaceutical  
Pharmaceutical worldwide adjusted operational sales grew 7.2%*, driven by DARZALEX (daratumumab), a biologic 
for the treatment of multiple myeloma, STELARA (ustekinumab), a biologic for the treatment of a number of immune-
mediated inflammatory diseases, ERLEADA (apalutamide), a next-generation androgen receptor inhibitor for the 
treatment of patients with prostate cancer, CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel), a BCMA-directed CAR-T 
immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and XARELTO 
(rivaroxaban), a direct oral anticoagulant.  Also contributing to growth were sales of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine 
(Ad26.COV2.S) for the prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus.  This growth was partially offset by declines in sales of 
REMICADE (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, 
IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), an oral, once daily therapy approved for use in treating certain B-cell malignancies, a type 
of blood or lymph node cancer, and ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate), an oral, once daily medication for use in 
combination with prednisone for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  
 
MedTech 
MedTech worldwide adjusted operational sales grew 6.4%*, driven primarily by electrophysiology products in 
Interventional Solutions, contact lenses in Vision, wound closure products in General Surgery, and knees in 
Orthopaedics.  MedTech worldwide operational sales grew 11.0%*, with the acquisition of Abiomed contributing 
4.6%.

 FULL-YEAR 2023 GUIDANCE: 
Johnson & Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because the company 
is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, unusual gains and losses, 
acquisition-related expenses and purchase accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort.  These 
items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to Johnson & Johnson's results computed in 
accordance with GAAP.

COVID-19 Vaccine related costs include remaining commitments and obligations, including external manufacturing network exit costs 
and required clinical trial expenses, associated with the Company's completion of its COVID-19 vaccine contractual commitments.
In the first quarter of 2023, the company completed a prioritization of its research and development (R&D) investment within the 
Pharmaceutical segment to focus on the most promising medicines with the greatest benefit to patients. This resulted in the exit of 
certain programs including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, HIV and hepatitis.   The 
restructuring expenses of $130 million in the quarter include the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments.
The tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax 
special items in arriving at adjusted earnings.European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company’s previously registered 
products. MDR is a replacement of the existing European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of 
currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021. The Company considers the 
adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations.  The Company has 
excluded only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss 
used for making operating decisions and assessing performance which is expected to be completed during 2024.
