CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and Johnson & Johnson's other publicly available documents contain "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson
and its subsidiaries (the "Company") also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to
historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements
may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with,
among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and
dispositions; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to
uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if
underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition
could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to
rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition
•Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s
continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory
approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and
technologies in the United States and other important markets;
•The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing biosimilars and generics and resulting revenue and market share
losses;
•Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar
or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges,
potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;
•Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process
obsolescence;
•Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies;
•Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and
•Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the
Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.
Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity
•Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action
on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation
expense and share price impact;
•Impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product
liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;
•Impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability,
personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings;
•Increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which
carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business;
•Failure to meet compliance obligations in the McNEIL-PPC, Inc. Consent Decree or any other compliance agreements with governments or
government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions;
•Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new
products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of health care products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, health care products
and services; environmental protection and sourcing of raw materials;
•Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in relevant markets, including
requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union's Medical Devices Regulation;
•Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, including changes related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States, increasing
audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and
•Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives and Healthcare Market Trends
•Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward health care cost containment, including the continued consolidation among health care providers and
other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of health care
expenses, significant new entrants to the health care markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs
and price increases;
•Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of health care products and services due to economic hardship
and budgetary constraints;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development
collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to
competitive pressures;
•The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not
be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; and
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to
realize than expected.
Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally
•The risks associated with global operations on the Company and its customers and suppliers, including foreign governments in countries in which the
Company operates.
•Impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and
resulting margins;
•Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade
restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation;
•The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental
controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems;
•The impact of global public health crises and pandemics, including the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic;
•Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company's products and services, cause disruptions
in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and
integrity of the Company's products and operations; and
•The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world including social and economic disruptions and
instability of financial and other markets.
Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations
•Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally, through third party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or
involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory
action;
•Interruptions and breaches of the Company's information technology systems or those of the Company's vendors, which could result in reputational,
competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action;
•Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that
may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products; and
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the global supply chain, including the
Company's transaction with Jabil, may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from
applicable regulatory authorities. Disruptions associated with the announced global supply chain actions may adversely affect supply and sourcing of
materials used in the Company's products.
Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks that
could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should
understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete
statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made
from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments.
PART I
Item 1. BUSINESS
General
    Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development,
manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting
business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was
incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.
    The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the
resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer Health
(previously referred to as Consumer), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior
management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those
companies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located.
Segments of Business
    The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by
this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Report; and Note 17 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Consumer Health
    The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products focused on personal healthcare used in the skin health/beauty, over-the-counter
medicines, baby care, oral care, women’s health and wound care markets. Major brands in skin health/beauty include the AVEENO; CLEAN & CLEAR;
DR. CI:LABO; NEUTROGENA and OGX product lines. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines include the broad family of TYLENOL acetaminophen

active lifecycle development programs.
Medical Devices
    The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics, Surgery, and Vision fields. Medical
Devices in Interventional Solutions include Electrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to treat cardiovascular diseases, Neurovascular care
(Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke; the Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) is comprised of products in support of Hips, Knees,
Trauma, and Spine, Sports & Other; the Surgery portfolios (Ethicon) include advanced and general surgery offerings, solutions that focus on Breast
Aesthetics (Mentor) and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures; and Johnson & Johnson Vision products such as ACUVUE Brand disposable
contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers,
and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
Geographic Areas
    Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development,
manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the
primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of Business – Consumer Health,”
“– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with
the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.
    Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and
commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system
uncertainties.
Raw Materials
    Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary
unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.
Patents
    The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are
licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing
processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries
face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key
pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the
Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.®

    Sales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 9.3% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2020.
Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson &
Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARAThe latest expiring United States patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring European patent
expires in 2024.
Sales of the Company’s second largest product, DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO™ (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-
fihj), accounted for approximately 5.1% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2020.
Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns patents related to DARZALEX, and
Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patents. The latest expiring licensed United States patent expires in 2029. The latest expiring
licensed European patent expires in 2031. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO™.
Sales of the Company’s third largest product, IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), accounted for approximately 5.0% of the Company's total revenues for
fiscal 2020. Accordingly, patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Pharmacyclics LLC (an AbbVie company) owns the
patents related to IMBRUVICA, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patents. The Pharmacyclics patents and their expiration dates
are listed in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book). Pharmacyclics LLC and Janssen Biotech, Inc. have
entered into confidential settlement agreements with certain generic companies granting licenses to market their generic ibrutinib products in the United
States before the expiration of certain patents.
Trademarks
    The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all
available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers
these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.
Seasonality
    Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other
quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.
Competition
    In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines
without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the
development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative
products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of
its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of
customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Environment
    The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in
all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the
past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.
Regulation
    The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general
trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental
regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the
drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy,
manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S.
FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a
corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device
regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation.®

    The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product
withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate
product recalls.
    The U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are
not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the
U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products,
refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health
professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or
criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain
conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the US Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory
action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or
approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different
countries in which we conduct business.
    
The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and
legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and
programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Laws and
regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased
focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and health care providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require
disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to certain non-
physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain
prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased
attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally.
    
U.S. government agencies continue efforts to repeal, modify, or invalidate provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA)
which passed in 2010. For example, federal legislation repealed the ACA’s individual mandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employer-
sponsored healthcare plans; the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered
by Medicaid expansion plans; certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended; and certain short-term insurance plans not offering the full array of ACA
benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of these changes are being challenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains
uncertain. The ACA has also been subject to judicial challenge. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Texas v. Azar, which
challenges the constitutionality of the ACA. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the ACA but the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains
in effect. The U.S. government also continues to propose and implement changes to the Medicare Part D benefit including the size of manufacturer
discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of the benefit. There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform
proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing federal landscape has both positive and
negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal law, and potential modification or
repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry.
    In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state
attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
    Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory
requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, that may affect sourcing,
supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.
The global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the U.S. and global economies. The U.S.
FDA and other health authorities have shifted resources and priorities to meet the many challenges presented by the pandemic. Pandemic-related
disruptions could negatively impact the processing of regulatory submissions and slow agency review times necessary for the approval or clearance of new
drugs and devices. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess.

Employees and Human Capital Management
As of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, the number of employees were approximately:
2020 2019 
Employees 136,400 133,200 
Full-time equivalent (FTE) positions 134,500 132,200 
“Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns and co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more
recently acquired companies and individuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also excluded.
 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of individual employees as some work part-time.
 
Strategy
The Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its long-term strategy. Management is
responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce the Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes
related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus
areas:
•Attracting and recruiting the best talent
•Developing and retaining talent
•Empowering and inspiring talent
Underpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), innovation,
health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed both professionally and personally while helping the Company
achieve its business goals.
Culture and Employee Engagement
At Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to patients, consumers, customers,
healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide are further guided by the Company’s Code of Business Conduct
which sets basic requirements for business conduct and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide
additional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company conducts global surveys that offer its employees the
ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2020, 93% of
global employees across 78 countries participated in Our Credo Survey which is offered in 36 languages.
Growth and Development
To continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top talent. The Company
believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers.
Accordingly, professional development programs and educational resources1

are available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each person’s unique career path while creating a
robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to
ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2020, 44.6% of employees in Manager and above job
categories took advantage of career opportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines (including upward promotion or lateral
transfer and excluding employees in the research and development organizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 5.2%.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
The Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity and inclusion. Enabling
employees to perform at their best while being themselves is fundamental to the Company's continued success. The Company’s DEI vision is: Be yourself,
change the world. The Company's DEI strategy focuses on three pillars that reflect the strategic priorities identified to enable the Company to address the
challenges and opportunities presented by this evolving understanding of diversity:
•Accelerate the Company’s efforts to advance a culture of inclusion and innovation
•Build a diverse workforce for the future
•Enhance business results and reputation
The Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual employee feedback which remind the
Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same everywhere.
Compensation and Benefits
As part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain top talent. The
Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and benefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal
minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where possible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees'
financial, physical, and mental well-being, including annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and
welfare benefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.
Health, Wellness and Safety
The Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health for humanity starts with
advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and tools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as
well as temporary contractors and visitors to the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being
programs throughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings best-in-class and to help
employees achieve their personal mind and body health goals. The programs and practices the Company advances covers three core dimensions: Healthy
Eating, Healthy Movement and Healthy Mind.

Item 1A.    RISK FACTORS
An investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks to identify, manage and
mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and many are outside of the Company's control and cannot therefore be
eliminated. In addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors
set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete
discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or
financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.
Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations
The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s earnings.
The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company’s businesses compete with
companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived
product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to
acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in
significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly
products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could
negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the
related product development.
For the Company’s pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors
gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for
a biological product. For the Company’s medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are
especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make
the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s consumer health businesses face intense competition
from other branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer
products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.
Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and reputation.
The Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The
Company's subsidiaries operate 90 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past,
and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions
can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires),
natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics.
Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation
and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party manufacturer could result in delays
and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of
their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver
those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be able to meet our
near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business.
Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties, including the Company’s strategic partnership with Jabil in the Medical Devices segment, to
manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s
intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible
termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third
party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, encounter financial difficulties, are
unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may
7
experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need to seek and source other qualified third-party
manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely.
Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business.
Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a
growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our
rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic
version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured – often in unregulated,
unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as the lack of regulation of their contents.
The industry's failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in
our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from
their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company’s business and could cause disruptions or future impact to the
Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to risks associated with global health crises and pandemics, including the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and its mutations
(COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company’s
business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The
spread of COVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of the Company's employees),
and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our
patients, customers, employees and business partners. The Company continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans
in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from
being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.
While the U.S. and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies, the extent to which COVID-19 will impact the Company's future
operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak. Any resurgence in COVID-19
infections could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. The
continued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Company's operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations,
supply chain, including third-party suppliers, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company's
business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally.
We also face uncertainties related to our efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, including uncertainties related to the risk that our development
programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval or Emergency Use Authorization from regulatory authorities; risks associated
with clinical trial data, including further analyses of existing preclinical or clinical trial data that may be inconsistent with the data used for selection of the
JNJ-78436735 vaccine candidate and dose level for the Phase 3 (ENSEMBLE) trial; the risk that clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations
and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; disruptions in
the relationships between us, our third-party suppliers and external manufacturers; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive
products; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any
such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes
in the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development related to COVID-19; the risk that we may not be able to
create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may experience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have
access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively
impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine candidate within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and
risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such products, including in the U.S.
In addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of
the other risks described in this "Risk Factors" section and those incorporated by reference herein, including risks relating to the Company’s effective tax
rate as a result of changes in consumption as well as changes in
8
laws relating to supply of the Company’s products. Given that developments concerning the COVID-19 pandemic have been constantly evolving,
additional impacts and risks may arise, including litigation, that are not presently known to the Company.
Risk Related to the Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings
Global sales in the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing
pressures.
Sales of the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government
healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting
downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of
Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in further pricing
pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU,
United Kingdom and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls,
limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.
The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage.
In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as
patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or
consumer protection laws. The Company's more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district
litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large
and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the Company is a
defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale,
manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate
outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters,
potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution
of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations and cash flows for that period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however the Company utilizes a wholly-
owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.
Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and
cause reputational damage.
Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence,
can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its
counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These
circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and
could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related
sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
The Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government investigations,
legal actions and penalties.
Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action, by national, state and local
government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which they operate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing
Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines
and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing,
pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Scrutiny of health care
industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of
significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and®
9
litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.
Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in
statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in
the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any
time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.
See Note 8 on income taxes for additional information.
The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In
connection with the 2015 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, companies are
required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other
countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However,
any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of
reserves.
Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property
The Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the Company’s businesses.
The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These
rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the
U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection
for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally
anticipated.
Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences,
oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These
proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of
third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in
question.
The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the
Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic
versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the
Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act
(BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed
biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the
USPTO is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.
In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent
infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a
very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, “Legal
Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Risks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization
Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse
impact on the Company’s long-term success.
10
The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the
evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue
losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products
introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2020 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to
develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval,
and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.
The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and
licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology
products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development
programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care providers’
future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property
protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company’s products from
competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the
marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or
uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and
efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.
Risk Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions
The Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally.
The Company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial, economic and political risks, including
those listed below.
Foreign Currency Exchange: In fiscal 2020, approximately 48% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 23% in Europe,
7% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency
exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the
U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are
translated into U.S. dollars.
Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks: The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high
inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary,
as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost
reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In
addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively
impact the Company’s operating results.
Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products: The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or
other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the
Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal
under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced
imports has grown significantly.
Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with
respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded
companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the
purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore
involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human
pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities;
11
therefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application
and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed
at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional
administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including
exclusion from health care programs.
Other Legal, Social and Political Risks. Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include:
•protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements;
•compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture
or sell its products in the relevant market;
•diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;
•potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;
•political or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and
•geopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, epidemics or pandemics.
Failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.
We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. Rating agencies routinely
evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating
agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur,
reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any
announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital
markets.
Other Risks
Our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse workforce.
Our continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for
highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate
highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable and inclusive work
environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders,
our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our
long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions
involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation.
To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to
process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be
subject to legal protection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which
affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the
Company’s sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response
capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. To date, the Company has
not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently
changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely
impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and
12
regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may
not be sufficient to cover all financial, legal, business or reputational losses.
Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and results of operations.
Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our
operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.
Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities
and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to
access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations, which may increase operational costs.
Concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or
mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we
may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely
affect our business, results of operations or financial condition

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Organization and Business Segments
Description of the Company and Business Segments
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development,
manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the
primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer), Pharmaceutical and Medical
Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin health/beauty, over-the-counter
pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail
outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases,
neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers,
wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the
orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers,
hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the
resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business
segments.
In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all
product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the
improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as
protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for
the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Management’s Objectives
With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for
humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this
common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes.
The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products
and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2020 sales. In 2020, $12.2 billion was invested in
research and development and $7.3 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create
value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.
A critical driver of the Company’s success is the 134,500 diverse employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the
Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to
also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence.
This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering
value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.

Results of Operations
Analysis of Consolidated Sales
For discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2019 and 2018 see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-
K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
In 2020, worldwide sales increased 0.6% to $82.6 billion as compared to an increase of 0.6% in 2019. These sales changes consisted of the following:
Sales incr ease/(decr ease) due to: 2020 2019
Volume 3.5 % 3.7 %
Price (2.3) (0.9)
Currency (0.6) (2.2)
Total 0.6 % 0.6 %
The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.3% in 2020 and a negative impact of 1.7% in
2019.
Sales by U.S. companies were $43.1 billion in 2020 and $42.1 billion in 2019. This represents increases of 2.5% in 2020 and 0.5% in 2019. Sales by
international companies were $39.5 billion in 2020 and $40.0 billion in 2019. This represents a decrease of 1.3% in 2020 and an increase of 0.7% in 2019.
The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.3%, 3.9% and 2.8%, respectively. The ten-year
compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.0%, 3.9% and 2.1%, respectively.
In 2020, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 2.8% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 2.0% and a
positive currency impact of 0.8%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) experienced a sales decline of 10.2% as compared
to the prior year, which included operational growth of 0.4% offset by a negative currency impact of 10.6%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa
region experienced a sales decline of 2.7% as compared to the prior year, including an operational decline of 3.1% partially offset by a positive currency
impact of 0.4%.
The 2020 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details).
The Company estimated that the fiscal year 2020 sales growth rate was enhanced by approximately 1.0%. While the additional week added a few days to
sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.
In 2020, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0%
of the total consolidated revenues. In 2019, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately
15.0%, 12.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues.

The OTC franchise sales of $4.8 billion increased 8.5% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily attributable to sales from TYLENOLdriven
by COVID-19 stocking demand, ZYRTECdue to competitor product out of stock and PEPCID due to competitive product withdrawal both in the U.S.,
and increased consumption in anti-smoking aids. International sales were negatively impacted by COVID-19 and low incidence of cough and flu.
The Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales were $4.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 3.1% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to
negative COVID-19 related impacts and SKU rationalization partially offset by growth in eCommerce and new product innovation.
The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 7.4% as compared to the prior year primarily attributable to sales of LISTERINEmouthwash due
to U.S. eCommerce and club channel growth, increased stocking demand related to COVID-19 and new product launches in Asia Pacific.
The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 9.4% compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to COVID-19
related impacts, SKU rationalization and the Baby Center divestiture in the U.S. partially offset by strength in AVEENObaby.
The Women’s Health franchise sales were $0.9 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by
COVID-19 impacts.
The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 7.2% as compared to the prior year. Growth was due to strong performance
of NEOSPORIN and BAND-AID Brand Adhesive Bandages and COVID-19 related demand in the Asia Pacific region.®

Immunology products sales were $15.1 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 7.9% as compared to the prior year driven by strong uptake of
STELARA (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis and strength in TREMFYA(guselkumab) in Psoriasis. This was partially offset by
COVID-19 related demand and lower sales of REMICADE(infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition.
The patents for REMICADE(infliximab)in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been
introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE in those markets. Additional biosimilar
competition will likely result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE in markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version
of REMICADE was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S.
market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE.
Infectious disease products sales were $3.6 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 4.7% as compared to the prior year primarily due to strong sales
of SYMTUZAand JULUCA.This was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTAand PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA due to increased competition and
loss of exclusivity of PREZISTAin certain countries outside the U.S.
Neuroscience products sales were $6.5 billion, representing an increase of 3.5% as compared to the prior year. Paliperidone long-acting injectables
growth driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA from new patient starts and
persistence. The growth was partially offset by migration from RISPERDAL CONSTA(risperidone) and declines in CONCERTA(methylphenidate) due
to competitive entrants.
Oncology products achieved sales of $12.4 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 15.7% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth
were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by patient uptake in all lines of therapy and the launch of a subcutaneous formulation in the U.S.
and E.U.; IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to market growth globally and maintaining strong share and the continued global launch uptake and share gains of
ERLEADA (apalutamide). Additionally, the growth was negatively impacted by declining sales of ZYTIGA(abiraterone acetate) and VELCADE
(bortezomib) due to generic competition.
Pulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.1 billion, representing an increase of 20.0% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of
OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth. Additionally, sales of TRACLEER
(bosentan) were negatively impacted by generics and migration to OPSUMIT.
Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.9 billion, a decline of 6.0% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET (canagliflozin) were due to market growth and favorable channel mix dynamics in the U.S. and strength in the European
region partially offset by U.S. share declines due to competitive pressures. The growth of XARELTO(rivaroxaban) was due to demand growth partially
offset by higher rebates. Lower sales of PROCRIT/ EPREX(epoetin alfa) were due to biosimilar competition.® ®

The Surgery franchise sales were $8.2 billion in 2020, a decrease of 13.4% from 2019. The decline in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by the
negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S. This was partially offset by the success of new products outside the U.S. and the
recovery of an isolated supply disruption in the prior year related to SURGIFLO. The decline in General Surgery was primarily driven by the negative
impact of COVID-19 and the ASP divestiture.
The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $7.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 12.2% from 2019. The decline in hips was driven by the negative impact of
COVID-19 partially offset by a leadership position in the Anterior approach, strong market demand for the ACTIS stem and enabling technologies –
KINCISE™ and VELYS™ Hip Navigation. The decline in knees was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19. The decline in Trauma was driven by
the negative impact of COVID-19 partially offset by strength from new products. The decline in Spine, Sports & Other was driven by the negative impact

Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering,
testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy
and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high
quality and innovative products.
Research and Development increased as a percent to sales primarily driven by:
•Segment mix driven by a higher percentage of sales generated by the Pharmaceutical business versus the prior year
•The negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Devices sales
•Increased investment in the Medical Devices business related to robotics and digital programs
•Portfolio progression including the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pharmaceutical business, net of governmental reimbursements
Research facilities are located in the U.S., Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional R&D support in over 30 other countries.
In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to a
partial impairment due to timing and progression of one of the digital surgery platforms acquired with the Auris Health acquisition. In the fiscal year 2019,
the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the remaining intangible asset value related to the development program of AL-8176, an
investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of
Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was based on additional information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the
Company's decision to abandon the development of AL-8176.
Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down
of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains
and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty
income.
Other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2020 was unfavorable by $0.4 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to the following:

2020 litigation expense primarily associated with T alc related reserves and certain settlements ($4.0 billion). 2019 litigation expense primarily related to the agreement in
principle to settle opioid litigation ($4.0 billion).
2020 is primarily driven by a contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the
Auris Health acquisition.
2019 included the divestiture of ASP
Interest (Income) Expense: The fiscal year 2020 included net interest expense of $90 million as compared to income of $39 million in the fiscal year
2019. This was primarily due to reduced interest income resulting from lower rates of interest earned on cash balances and a higher average debt balance.
This was partially offset by a lower average debt interest rate and a higher average cash balance. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled
$25.2 billion at the end of 2020, and averaged $22.2 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $19.3 billion and
$19.5 billion average cash balance in 2019. The total debt balance at the end of 2020 was $35.3 billion with an average debt balance of $31.5 billion as
compared to $27.7 billion at the end of 2019 and an average debt balance of $29.1 billion. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued
approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company
issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion.

Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense.
Consumer Health Segment:
In 2020, the Consumer Health segment loss before tax as a percent of sales was (7.6)% versus income before tax of 14.8% in 2019. The decrease in the
income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:
•Higher litigation expense of $3.9 billion in 2020 vs. $0.4 billion in 2019 (primarily associated with talc related reserves and certain settlements)
•The fiscal year 2019 included a gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO
partially offset by:
•Portfolio and investment optimization including execution of the ongoing SKU rationalization program
Pharmaceutical Segment:
In 2020, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 33.9% versus 20.9% in 2019. The increase in the income before tax as a
percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:
•Lower litigation expense of $0.8 billion in 2020 vs. $4.3 billion in 2019 (primarily related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation,
of which $1.0 billion is in 2020 and $4.0 billion is in 2019)
•An in-process research and development charge of $0.9 billion in fiscal 2019 related to Alios
•Lower acquisition and integration related costs in fiscal 2020
•Leveraging in selling, marketing and administrative expense
Medical Devices Segment: In 2020, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.3% versus 28.1% in 2019. The decrease
in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:
•A gain of $2.0 billion related to the ASP divestiture recorded in the fiscal 2019
•Idle capacity costs associated with COVID-19 related production slow downs in fiscal 2020
•Establishment of obsolescence reserves and fixed cost deleveraging associated with the impact of COVID-19 in fiscal 2020

associated with the Auris Health acquisition
•Litigation expense was $0.3 billion in 2020 vs. $0.4 billion in 2019
Restructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to
enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its
product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of
strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its
network.  Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In
total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by
2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70%
of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion, which is included on the
following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.2 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of
products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.3 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.
See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.
Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 10.8% in 2020 and 12.7% in 2019. During the fiscal first quarter of 2021,
the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations addressing the requirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. The Company recorded a
pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion in the fiscal year 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional pre-tax $1.0
billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied.
For discussion related to the fiscal 2020 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of January 3, 2021, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of
January 3, 2021, the net debt position was $10.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $8.4 billion. There was an increase in the net debt position due to
increased borrowings in the fiscal third quarter of 2020. The debt balance at the end of 2020 was $35.3 billion as compared to $27.7 billion in 2019.
Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and
does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources,
borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to
fund operating needs, including the talc litigation and agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of which the majority may be paid over the next two
to three years. In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market
conditions are favorable. In the fiscal
30
third quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end. In the
fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition which closed on
October 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has access to its cash
outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost.
The following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 3, 2021: To satisfy these
obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.

approximate $0.9 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of a COVID-19 vaccine.
Financing and Market Risk
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into
forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions
primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of
the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2021 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $121 million.
Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2021 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward
contracts by $148 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and
therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.
The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by
entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial
instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1,667 million. In either scenario, at
maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on
future anticipated cash flows.
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into
contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is
no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit
support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting
agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements.
The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of
fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if
interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the
unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $36 million.
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2020, the Company secured a new 364-day
Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 9, 2021. Interest charged on borrowings under
the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)
Swap Curve or other applicable market
rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.

Total borrowings at the end of 2020 and 2019 were $35.3 billion and $27.7 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings was the issuance of notes
in 2020 when market conditions were favorable. In 2020, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $10.1 billion compared to net
debt of $8.4 billion in 2019. Total debt represented 35.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2020 and 31.8% of total capital in 2019.
Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2020 was $24.04 compared to $22.59 at year-end 2019.
A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Dividends
The Company increased its dividend in 2020 for the 58th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.98 per share in 2020 and $3.75 per share in 2019.
On January 4, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.01 per share, payable on March 9, 2021 to shareholders of record as of
February 23, 2021.
Other Information
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires
that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures.
Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates
are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue
recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for
pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not
limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates,
employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The
Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information
reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 3, 2021 and through the date of this report. The
accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related
reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact
to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 3, 2021, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and
duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting
periods.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are
satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90
days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable
consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and
projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through
the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to
dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product
recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in
accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales
returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical
Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The
sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2020 and 2019.
32
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales.
Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on
historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period
and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of
revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers.
For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.
In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative
partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part
of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
disclosures on collaborations.
Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect
on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a
material financial statement impact.
Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by
segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019.

Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between
U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The
Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the
earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the
Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts.
The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and
at current currency exchange rates.
During the fiscal first quarter of 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations addressing the requirements for tax deductibility of
settlement payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion in fiscal 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation
and recorded an additional pre-tax $1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability
claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where
applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals
in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable
and can be reasonably estimated.
See Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions
regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these
assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.
Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination
indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,
mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
details on these rates.
Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their
services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a
combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the
service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield.
Prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational
sales, adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market
value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return.  The fair
values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time
of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total
shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Economic and Market Factors
COVID-19 considerations and business continuity
The Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on its business and financial results
based upon information available at this time, as follows:
•Operating Model: The Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility designed into its manufacturing,
research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities.
•Supply Chain: The Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities while closely monitoring and
maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas to ensure adequate and effective distribution.
•Business Continuity: The robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been instrumental in preparing the Company
for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs remains uninterrupted.
•Workforce: The Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing, distribution, commercial and research
operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been established for other employees.
•Liquidity: The Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital markets for the foreseeable future.
In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion
outstanding at year end, for additional liquidity. Additionally, in the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a
total of $7.5 billion. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition on October 1, 2020 and
for general corporate purposes.
•Domestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global legislative efforts to combat the
COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently, the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have
a material impact on the Company’s operations.
In fiscal 2020, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract manufacturing
organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with future supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable
rights to such production if capacity is not required. Amounts paid and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing organizations of
approximately $0.9 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other, other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities accounts in the Company's
consolidated balance sheet upon execution of each agreement. Additionally, the Company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing
arrangements with government related organizations.
The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have
expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products
responsibly. For the period 2010 - 2020, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health
care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to
monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way
companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly
inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In
the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic
price increases.
In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to
as “Brexit”. The U.K. officially exited the E.U. on January 31, 2020, however, there was a transition period to allow time to agree the terms of a new trade
deal. On December 30, 2020, the U.K., E.U. and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) signed the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation
Agreement (TCA). Over the last few years, Brexit has created global political and economic uncertainty and has led to volatility in exchange rates and
interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. While the UK and EU have now agreed on a future trade and
cooperation agreement, it is still unclear what the ultimate financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will
have. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial position or operating results. As of January 3, 2021, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 6% of the Company’s
consolidated assets and less than 3% of the Company's fiscal twelve months revenues.
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies
in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2020 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately
$384 million and net income by approximately $115 million.
36
Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory
tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that
particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted.  This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the
statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change
is enacted.
The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment
and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing
prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global
economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.
The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug
Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents,
seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering
those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar
versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those
products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could
launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.
Legal Proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial
and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 3, 2021, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation
matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and
adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other
litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or
range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events
and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments
can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate;
scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are
significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve
comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent
adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be
reasonably estimated.
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal
proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.
However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.
See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded
figures.
Description of the Company and Business Segments
The Company has approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of
products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to
human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer), Pharmaceutical and Medical
Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin health/beauty, over-the-counter
pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail
outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases,
neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers,
wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the
orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields, which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and
retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
New Accounting Standards
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
ASU 2018-18: Collaborative Arrangements
The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2020. This update clarifies the interaction between ASC 808, Collaborative
Arrangements and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The update clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative
arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. In addition, the update precludes an entity from presenting
consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue if the counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. The adoption of this
standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2020. This update introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model,
which requires an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on
initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity is required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate of credit losses
expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2018-14: Compensation - Defined Benefit Plans
The Company adopted this standard in the fiscal year ended 2020. This standard revised the financial statement note disclosure requirements of ASC 715-
20 for defined benefit plan sponsors. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for defined benefit plan disclosures.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Not Adopted as of January 3, 2021
The Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's
financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 29, 2019. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2020 that impacted the Company.
Cash Equivalents
The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly
liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy
of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in
government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs).
RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their value. The
Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that
the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that
collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date
of purchase are classified as marketable securities.
Investments
Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments
classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as
long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates
such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through
earnings, as required. 
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:
Building and building equipment 20 - 30 years
Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years
Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with
developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which
generally range from 3 to 8 years.
The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or
economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is
determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between
46
the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of
estimated future cash flows.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs
with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain
rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as
a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and
projected market conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's
pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.2 billion and $7.0 billion
as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily
through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to
dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product
recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in
accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales
returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical
Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The
sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales.
Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on
historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period
and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of
revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers.
For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.
See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.
Shipping and Handling
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are included in
selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all
periods presented.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The
Company completed its annual impairment test for 2020 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth
quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying
project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the
intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by
economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill.
47
Financial Instruments
As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1
having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for
undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the
Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness
of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial
Instruments.
Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of
identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating
leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an
underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance
leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance
sheet.
ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the
lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of
lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are
included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master
service agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.
The Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing equipment. The ROU asset pertaining to
operating leases was $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The lease liability was $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion in 2020 and 2019,
respectively. The operating lease costs were $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included
in the measurement of lease liabilities were $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Product Liability
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted
periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when
those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not
record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that
exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments
made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments
made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts
capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize
drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are
exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by
one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and
royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development.
48
Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense
because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for
these collaborations is as follows:
Nature/Type of Collaboration  Statement of Earnings Presentation
Third-party sale of product & profit share payments received Sales to customers
Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory
approval)*Cost of products sold
Royalties received from collaborative partner Other income (expense), net
Upfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-
regulatory approval)Research and development expense
Research and development payments to collaborative partner Research and development expense
Research and development payments received from collaborative partner or
government entityReduction of Research and development expense
*Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life.
For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense.
The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO, co-developed with
Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.
Separately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX, licensed from Genmab A/S.
Advertising
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising
expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $2.1 billion, $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion in fiscal years
2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP
accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax
regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
In 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This law included provisions for a
comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January
1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed
earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This tax is payable over
8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2020 was
approximately $7.7 billion, of which $6.9 billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet.
The balance of this account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next 12 months.
The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s
total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows
companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or
provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years
upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). In 2018, the Company elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded
are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.
The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The
Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the
earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company®
®
®
49
intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the
U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this
repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Net Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common
stock using the treasury stock method.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives,
product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability
valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and
can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the
minimum amount is accrued.
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not
limited to: the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates,
employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The
Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information
reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 3, 2021 and through the date of this report. The
accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related
reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact
to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude
and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting
periods.
Annual Closing Date
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year
consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in
fiscal year 2020, and will be the case again in fiscal year 2026.
Reclassification
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

6.Fair Value Measurements
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange
rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency
interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.
Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are
designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment
hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These
forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings,
thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features.
The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit
ratings and netting agreements. As of January 3, 2021, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted to $1.1 billion
net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers
credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment
grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and
payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 3, 2021, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange
contracts, and cross currency interest rate swaps of $37.8 billion and $30.6 billion, respectively. As of December 29, 2019, the Company had notional
amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps of $45.3 billion and $20.1 billion, respectively.
All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current
earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge
transaction.
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly
effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these
contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the
hedged transaction.
Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to
interest expense in the period in which they occur. The effect of which are immaterial for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019.
Gains and losses on net investment hedge are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The
portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company
assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be
highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued.
The Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the
Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by
changes in exchange rates.
As of January 3, 2021, the balance of deferred net gain on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $652 million after-
tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the
amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected
to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate
contracts, net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are
ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

For the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 for equity investments without readily determinable market values, $76 million and $57
million, respectively, of the changes in fair value reflected in net income were the result of impairments. There were $21 million and $19 million,
respectively, of changes in fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices.
Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs
used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all
future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot
foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be
realized upon settlement or maturity, or(1) (2)
(1) (2)
(1)
(2)
56
that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds
equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent
liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow
methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.
The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.
Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.
The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 were as

The excess of the fair value over the carrying value of debt was $5.4 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020 and $3.0 billion at the end of fiscal year
2019.
In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion.
Fair value of the long-term debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted broker prices and significant other observable
inputs.
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2020, the Company secured a new 364-day
Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 9, 2021. Interest charged on borrowings under
the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)
Swap Curve or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material.
Throughout fiscal year 2020, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the
current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $2.6 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020, of which $1.8 billion is the current portion of the
long-term debt, and the remainder is commercial paper and local borrowings by international subsidiaries.
Throughout fiscal year 2019, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the
current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $1.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019, of which $1.1 billion is the current portion of the
long term debt, and the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries.

(1) For all periods presented the Company has subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under various tax incentives. International operations reflects the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with
statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate. The
2020 and 2019 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, which is further described below.
(2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code.
(3) Represents impact of adjustments to balances originally recorded as part of the 2017 TCJA provisional tax charge. Further information provided below.
(4) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
The fiscal year 2020 tax rate decreased by 1.9% compared to the fiscal year 2019 tax rate, which was primarily driven by the following items. In fiscal year
2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Federal
transitional provisions of TRAF allow companies, under certain conditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) to be
depreciated and amortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period.
TRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations for companies. The new cantonal tax
parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research and development tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF
allowed companies to elect either 1) tax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not to exceed 5
years. The Company currently has operations located in various Swiss cantons. During the fiscal year 2019, as described in further detail below, the
Company recorded the impacts of the TRAF that were enacted in that period.
During the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF legislation. Additionally, the Company
received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the remaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings
resulted in the Company revising its estimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., “step-up”) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded additional
deferred tax benefits in 2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss Tax Reform of approximately $0.4 billion or 2.6%
benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items:
•approximately $0.3 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and
cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the
Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•a $450 million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss subsidiaries’ assets as
described above; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•approximately $0.3 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss
deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s
effective tax rate reconciliation.
The Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF.
Also, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously impaired book value of
certain intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by approximately 1.2% which is(1)
(2)
(4)
(3) (3)
(4)
61
reflected as a “Tax Benefits on Capital Loss” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. In addition in the fiscal year 2020, the Company had lower income in
higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by:
•the impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to Talc for $4.0 billion which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of
23.5%;
•the accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $1.0 billion associated with a revised agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation
at an effective tax rate of 21.4%
The Company also generated additional tax benefits from stock-based compensation that were either exercised or vested; reduced the contingent
consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition (see Note 18); and reversal of some of its unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of
several years of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020.
The fiscal year 2019 tax rate decreased by 2.3% compared to the fiscal year 2018 tax rate. In addition to the impact of TRAF discussed in more detail
below, the primary drivers of the net decrease were as follows:
•The Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, which
resulted in a reduction of certain withholding and local taxes that it had previously recognized as part of the provisional Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA) tax charge in the fiscal year 2017 and finalized in the fiscal year 2018. Following the completion of this restructuring and approval by the
applicable local authorities, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $0.6 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $0.2 billion for U.S.
foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $0.4 billion decreasing the annual effective tax rate by 2.2%. This benefit has been reflected
as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•The impact of the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation for $4 billion (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) which
reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5% and decreased the Company’s annual effective tax rate by approximately
2.1%.
•In December of fiscal year 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in the Company revising the amount
of foreign tax credits that were initially recorded in the fiscal year 2017 as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge. As a result, the Company
recorded an increased deferred tax asset related to these foreign tax credits of approximately $0.3 billion or 1.7% to the annual effective tax rate.
This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•The Company reassessed its uncertain tax positions related to the current IRS audit and increased its unrecognized tax benefit by $0.3 billion
liability which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.5% (see section on Unrecognized Tax Benefits for additional
information). As these positions were related to uncertain tax regarding international transfer pricing, this expense has been classified as
“International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. Subsequent to December 29, 2019, the Company received and
agreed to Notices of Proposed Adjustments (NOPAs) from the IRS. The Company believes it is adequately reserved for potential exposures.
•There were several one-time tax impacts that resulted in a cumulative net tax benefit to the 2018 annual effective tax rate of 1.2%. These items
included the LifeScan divestiture, the adjustment to the 2017 provisional TCJA tax charge and the acceleration of certain tax deductions as part
of the 2017 tax return.
•More income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2018.
As described above for the Swiss tax legislation, in the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $0.1 billion which increased the
effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2019 by approximately 0.6%. This net tax expense related to federal and certain cantonal enactments in the fiscal year
2019 consisting of the following provisions:
•approximately $0.6 billion tax expense relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and
cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred by December 29, 2019; this expense has been reflected as “International Operations” on the
Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•a $0.9 billion deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss subsidiaries’ assets; this
benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•approximately $450 million of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss
deferred tax assets and liabilities and the new deferred tax asset for the Federal step-up. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on
international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.

In the fiscal year 2018, the Company completed its full assessment and finalized the accounting for the impact of the TCJA. The Company recorded net
adjustments to the above components of the provisional charge of approximately $0.2 billion. These revisions were based on updated estimates and
additional analysis by management as well as applying interpretative guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury to the facts and circumstances
that existed as of the TCJA enactment date. This charge was primarily related to additional deferred tax liabilities for foreign local and withholding taxes
for the remaining balance of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 that were not provided for in the 2017 provisional charge.
As described in Note 1, in the fiscal year 2018, the Company elected to treat GILTI as a period expense under the deferred method and recorded a deferred
tax cost of approximately $1.4 billion in the fiscal year 2018 related to facts and circumstances that existed on the date of TCJA enactment. During 2018,
the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries which resulted in a reduction of certain foreign withholding taxes that it
had recognized as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Following the completion of this restructuring and as a result of
clarification by Swiss tax authorities regarding the applicability of withholding tax to repatriation of certain earnings, the Company reversed a deferred tax
liability of $2.8 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $0.9 billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $1.9 billion. This benefit
has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.

The Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that these
subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets.
The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits:
(Dollars in Millions) 2020 2019 2018

The unrecognized tax benefits of $3.4 billion at January 3, 2021, if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The Company
conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the
United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2012. As of December 29, 2019, the Company classified
unrecognized tax benefits and related interest*
63
of approximately $0.9 billion as a current liability on the “Accrued taxes on Income” line of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the fiscal year 2020, the
Company made its final payments for approximately $0.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the final settlement of 2010-2012 tax audit liability.
In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2006. The Company believes
it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States.
However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax
positions.
The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities, except as previously noted on
amounts related to the current United States IRS audit. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax
expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $32 million, $50 million and $53 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The total amount of accrued interest was $468 million and $559 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.
9.Employee Related Obligations
At the end of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, employee related obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were:

Employee related obligations — non-current $ 10,771 10,663 
Prepaid employee related obligations of $656 million and $551 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

10.Pensions and Other Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover
most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their
dependents.
Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant.
In the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last five
years before retirement and the number of years of service (the Final Average Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are
calculated using a different formula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).
In January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,
regardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the benefits
accrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026. The impact of this change decreases the
PBO as of January 3, 2021 by approximately $1.8 billion and is included in the “Amendments” line in the Change in Benefit Obligation.
International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided.
The Company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future.
In 2020 and 2019 the Company used December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international
retirement and other benefit plans.
Net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2020, 2019 and 2018 include the following
components:
 Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans

Curtailments and settlements 23 73 1 — — — 
Net periodic benefit cost $ 790 593 923 524 551 502 
Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active
employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using
a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in
excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.
Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan
amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan
participants at the time of the plan amendment.

Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00 % 4.01 3.97 4.27 4.29 4.29 
The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The
resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. The Company's methodology in determining service and interest cost uses
duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows.
The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios
globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the
various asset class allocations by market.

In January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees, regardless of hire date, will earn
benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the benefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before
January 1, 2026.
The actuarial losses for retirement plans in 2020 and 2019 was primarily related to decreases in discount rates.
In 2019, the Company offered a voluntary lump-sum payment option for certain eligible former employees who are vested participants of the U.S.
Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan. The distribution of the lump-sums was completed by the end of fiscal 2019. The amount distributed in 2019 was
approximately $514 million.(1)

The Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. International Plans are funded in
accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans.
For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that
are not funded.
In 2020, the Company contributed $441 million and $429 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively.
The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded
pension plans at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively:

Each pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall administration and investment of the pension plans. In
determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax
regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives
to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority
of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed,
with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds.
The Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2020 and 2019 and target allocations for 2021 are as follows:

Debt securities 34 26 33 
Total plan assets 100 % 100 % 100 %
Determination of Fair Value of Plan Assets
The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If
listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market
parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.
While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or
assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
Valuation Hierarchy
The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are
described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.
The Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares
outstanding.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.
•Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the
custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a
quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2.
•Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on
which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of
the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models,
quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an
active market, they are classified as Level 2.
•Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual
securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are
not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar
characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs.
•Equity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.
Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
•Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets in the Level 2 category
have a quoted market price.
69
•Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by
the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are
classified as Level 2.

14.International Currency Translation
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international
subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative
rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority
of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
The other current and non current assets line within the Statement of Cash flows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account
includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those
located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are
reflected in the operating results.
A rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13.
Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $209 million, $267 million and $265 million in fiscal
years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
15.Earnings Per Share
The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021, December 29,
2019 and December 30, 2018:
(In Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2020 2019 2018
Basic net earnings per share $ 5.59 5.72 5.70 
Average shares outstanding — basic 2,632.8 2,645.1 2,681.5 
Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans 118.3 136.3 139.0 
Less: shares repurchased under treasury stock method (80.4) (97.8) (92.5)
Convertible debt shares — 0.7 0.7 
Adjusted average shares outstanding — diluted 2,670.7 2,684.3 2,728.7 
Diluted net earnings per share $ 5.51 5.63 5.61 
The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2020 excluded 18 million shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options
was greater than their average market value. As of January 3, 2021, the Company did not have convertible debt.
The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 excluded an insignificant number of shares related to stock options, as the exercise price
of these options was greater than the average market value of the Company’s stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019
included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $1 million after-tax.
The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2018 included all shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of all options was less
than the average market value of the Company's stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2018 included the dilutive effect of
convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $1 million after-tax.
16.Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements
At January 3, 2021, the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term
Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares
granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to
650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to
April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 277 million at the end of fiscal year 2020.
The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $1,005 million, $977 million and $978 million for fiscal years 2020,
2019 and 2018, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $210 million, $227
million and $192 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $248 million,
$209 million and $264 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for which options were exercised or restricted shares were vested. The
total
72
unrecognized compensation cost was $804 million, $823 million and $827 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted
average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.76 years, 1.71 years and 1.73 years for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Share-based
compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.
The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through market purchases throughout the
year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.
Stock Options
Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years. All options are granted at the
average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted
in the following table. For 2020, 2019 and 2018 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and
a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is
used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The average fair value of options granted was $16.42, $17.80 and $17.98, in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fair value was estimated
based on the weighted average assumptions of:
2020 2019 2018
Risk-free rate 1.47 % 2.56 % 2.77 %
Expected volatility 15.33 % 16.27 % 15.77 %
Expected life (in years) 7.0 7.0 7.0
Expected dividend yield 2.60 % 2.80 % 2.70 %

Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units
The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years. The Company also grants performance
share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three-year performance period. Whether any performance
share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a
three-year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted
operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, performance shares were granted with two equally-weighted
goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return.
The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target
number of performance share units granted.
A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of January 3, 2021 is presented below:
(Shares in Thousands)Outstanding Restricted

Shares at January 3, 2021 14,998 2,236 
The average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $139.58, $121.31 and $119.67 in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, using the
fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units
during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $650 million, $586 million and $614 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018,
respectively.
The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $160.54, $124.67 and $120.64 in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018,
calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the component goals at the date of grant. 
The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value
of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value
for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The
fair value of performance share units issued was $91 million, $119 million and $129 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.(1)

was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $0.8 billion applying a probability of success factor that ranged from
20% to 60% to reflect inherent development, regulatory and commercial risk for the different indications. The discount rate applied was approximately
16%. XBiotech may be eligible to receive additional payments upon the receipt of certain commercialization authorizations. The transaction was accounted
for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment.
Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with
significant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares previously held by Verily. The transaction was accounted for as a business
combination and included in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets,
primarily IPR&D, for $0.4 billion, goodwill for $0.2 billion, other assets of $0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $0.3 billion. The fair value of the
Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $0.4 billion.
On October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately $6.1 billion, net of cash acquired. The
fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets (IPR&D) of $6.0 billion, goodwill of $1.2 billion, other assets of
$0.5 billion and liabilities of $1.6 billion. The assets acquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal disorders, neuro-
inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on the asset, probability of success factors ranging from 20%
to 77% were used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent development and regulatory risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was
approximately 13%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible
for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment.(5)

During fiscal year 2019 certain businesses were acquired for $5.8 billion in cash and $1.4 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were
accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates
of acquisition.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $6.8 billion and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.
The fiscal year 2019 acquisitions primarily included DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a
broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products and Auris Health, Inc. a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused
in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
On January 17, 2019, the Company acquired DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad
range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of approximately ¥230 billion, which equates to approximately $2.1
billion, using the exchange rate of 109.06 Japanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the
Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity
investment in DR. CI:LABO.
The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Consumer Health segment. During the fiscal first quarter of
2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. The final fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable intangible assets
for $1.5 billion, goodwill for $1.2 billion and liabilities of $0.4 billion. The amortizable intangible assets were comprised of brand/trademarks and customer
relationships with a weighted average life of 15.3 years The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition
and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
On April 1, 2019 the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion, net of cash acquired. Additional
contingent payments of up to $2.35 billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health was a privately
held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of
the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D for $3.0 billion, goodwill for $2.0 billion,
marketable securities of $0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $1.8 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent payments mentioned above.
During the fiscal second quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded Other income of
approximately $1.1 billion for the reversal of all of the contingent consideration related to the timing of certain developmental and commercial milestones,
which are not expected to be met based on the Company’s current timelines. During the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a partial
IPR&D impairment charge of $0.1 billion related to timing and progression of the digital surgery platforms. A probability of success factor ranging from
55% to 95% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the contingent payments and IPR&D. The discount
rate applied was approximately 10%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected
to be deductible for tax purposes.
During fiscal year 2018 certain businesses were acquired for $0.9 billion in cash and $0.1 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were
accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates
of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $1.0 billion and has been assigned to
identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, supplemental pro forma
information for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
Divestitures
Subsequent to fiscal 2020, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the Pharmaceutical segment and received
combined proceeds of approximately $0.6 billion. The Company will reflect these brand divestitures in its 2021 financial results.
During fiscal year 2020, the Company sold 11.8 million shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its 8.3% ownership in the company. The transaction
resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF 337 million ($357 million) based on a sales price of CHF 28.55/share and an immaterial net loss. The
Company currently has rights to at least an additional 38.7 million shares (or approximately 20% of Idorsia equity) through a convertible loan with a
principal amount of CHF 445 million (due June 2027). Idorsia also has access to an approximate CHF 243 million credit facility with the Company. As of
January 3, 2021, Idorsia has not made any draw-downs under the credit facility.
During fiscal year 2019, the Company divested its ASP business to Fortive Corporation for an aggregate value of approximately $2.8 billion,
consisting of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and $0.1 billion of retained net receivables. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other ( income)
expense, net, of approximately $2.0 billion.
83
During fiscal year 2018, the Company divested the LifeScan Inc business for approximately $2.1 billion and retained certain net liabilities. Other
divestitures in fiscal year 2018 included: NIZORAL, RoCand certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. In 2018, the pre-tax gains on the
divestitures were approximately $1.2 billion.
In fiscal year 2018, the Company accepted a binding offer to form a strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., one of the world’s leading manufacturing
services providers for health care products and technology products. The Company is expanding a 12-year relationship with Jabil to produce a range of
products within the Ethicon Endo-Surgery and DePuy Synthes businesses. This transaction includes the transfer of employees and manufacturing sites. The
transfers were completed in fiscal year 2020. As of January 3, 2021, there were no assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December
29, 2019, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $0.1 billion of inventory and property, plant and equipment, net. For additional
details on the global supply chain restructuring see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
19.Legal Proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial;
supplier indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of
their business. Due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain trials have been rescheduled or delayed. The Company continues to monitor
its legal proceedings as the situation evolves.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount
of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 3, 2021, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are
probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust
accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and
regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss
beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be
affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and
legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in
dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-
party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse verdicts have
been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal
proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.
However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.
PRODUCT LIABILITY
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in
these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible
to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a
variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on
currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each
matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as
estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of
claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as
additional information becomes available.
The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE
Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL; XARELTO; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS Baby Powder;
INVOKANA; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESHFlexible Composite Mesh. As of January 3, 2021, in the United States there were approximately 560
plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding® ® 
®

® ® 
84
injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; 7,800 with respect to the PINNACLE
Acetabular Cup System; 14,900 with respect to pelvic meshes; 9,300 with respect to RISPERDAL; 12,600 with respect to XARELTO; 25,000 with
respect to body powders containing talc; 300 with respect to INVOKANA;and 4,200 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite
Mesh.
In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip
Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of
pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the
United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been
filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013,
DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims
with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy
reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had
revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, therefore bringing
to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does
not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip
patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive
information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs
associated with the United States settlement program and DePuy ASR Hip-related product liability litigation.
Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, DePuy) relating to the
PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive
information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a
multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in some state courts and in
countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts have been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for
retrial. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program,
adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular
Cup System and the related settlement program.
Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to
treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional
cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of West Virginia. The MDL Court is remanding cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic
mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and
the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition, class actions and
individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands, and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh
devices. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead
Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in
Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In March 2020, the Court entered damages awards to the three Lead
Applicants. The Company is appealing the decision. With respect to other group members, there will be an individual case assessment process which will
require proof of use and causally related loss. The form of the individual case assessment process has not yet been determined by the Court. The class
actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases. The Company has established accruals with respect to product
liability litigation associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh products.
Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh, claims for personal injury have been made
against Ethicon, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device.  Cases filed in federal courts in the
United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-
county litigation (MCL) has also been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the
matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of
the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending outside the United States. Discovery is proceeding in
these cases and certain of the cases are in preparation for trials.®

Claims have also been filed against Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral
Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL
in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the US, and in jurisdictions outside the US.
Discovery is underway in these cases.
In September 2019, plaintiffs’ attorney filed an application with the New Jersey Supreme Court seeking centralized management of 107 PROLENE™
Polypropylene Hernia System (“PHS”) cases. The New Jersey Supreme Court granted plaintiffs application in January 2020 and those cases have also been
transferred to an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Discovery is underway in these cases.
The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON PHYSIOMESHFlexible Composite Mesh,
PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System products.
Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL, and
related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated
with autism. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the
United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs
and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company,
including a verdict in October 2019 of $8.0 billion of punitive damages related to one single plaintiff which was subsequently reduced in January 2020 to
$6.8 million by the trial judge. The Company and plaintiff are each appealing this judgment. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the
United States cases and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals.
Claims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI);
Johnson & Johnson (J&J); and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO, Bayer AG and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United
States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases have been
filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a
coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and J&J announced an
agreement in principle to the settle the XARELTO cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the settlement became
final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved the majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company
has established accruals for its costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO related product liability litigation.
Personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the
use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. The number of pending personal injury lawsuits continues to increase, and the
Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state
courts in Missouri, New Jersey and California, and suits have also been filed outside the United States. The majority of cases are pending in federal court,
organized into a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL, the parties sought to exclude
experts through Daubert motions. In April 2020, the Court issued rulings that limit the scope of testimony, including some theories and testing methods, for
certain plaintiff expert witnesses and denied plaintiffs’ attempt to limit the scope of testimony of certain of the Company’s witnesses. With this ruling
made, case-specific discovery has begun per the Court’s directive.
In talc cases that have previously gone to trial, the Company has obtained defense verdicts in a number of them, but there have also been verdicts against
the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018
verdict of $4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion and, with additional
interest as of January 3, 2021, as the Company pursues further appeal, is currently $2.5 billion (the Ingham decision). An application for transfer of the case
to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and the Company is currently seeking review by the United States Supreme Court. The Company
continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds for the appeal of this verdict, as well as other verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the
Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has and may settle cases. The Company has established an
accrual for defense costs and reserves for the resolution of certain cases and claims, including the Ingham decision currently on appeal, in connection with
product liability litigation associated with body powders containing talc.
In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc.
(collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary chapter 11 petition commencing a reorganization under® ®

the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy
relates to Imerys’ potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys (Talc Claims). In its bankruptcy filing, Imerys
noted certain claims it alleges it has against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. The Company previously proposed to
resolve Imerys' (and the Company’s) obligations arising out of the Talc Claims by agreeing to assume the defense of litigation of all Talc Claims involving
the Company's products, waiving the Company’s indemnification claims against Imerys, and lifting the automatic stay to enable the Talc Claims to proceed
outside the bankruptcy forum with the Company agreeing to settle or pay any judgment against Imerys. In May 2020, Imerys and the asbestos claimants’
committee (Plan Proponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related thereto agreeing to put its North American
operations up for auction which was subsequently amended. The Company has objected to the Disclosure Statement and intends to object to the Plan of
Reorganization as currently structured. Additionally, in June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent (Cyprus) filed an adversary proceeding against
the Company as well as Imerys seeking a declaration of indemnity under certain contractual agreements. The Company denies such indemnification is
owed and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint arguing, among other things, that the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over
Cyprus’s claims against the Company. The Plan Proponents filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement to which the Company
objected. A hearing on the Plan Proponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order approving the Disclosure
Statement for the Ninth Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Imerys Talc America, Inc. and its Debtor Affiliates allowing Debtors to
proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan. The Company intends to continue to object to the Plan. A hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan has been
scheduled for June 2021.
In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers in the United States District Court for
the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in
body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result.
Plaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete as of August 2019. In
December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020, Defendants answered the complaint. Discovery is underway.
In June 2019, a shareholder filed a complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books and records inspection. In August
2019, Johnson & Johnson responded to the books and records complaint and filed a cross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the
Court heard oral argument. The Court has not yet ruled in the books and records action. In October 2019, December 2019, and January 2020, four
shareholders filed four separate derivative lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors and certain officers as
defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos
contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’SBaby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of
those alleged breaches. In February 2020, the four cases were consolidated into a single action under the caption In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder
Derivative Litigation.
In July 2020, a report was delivered to the Company’s Board of Directors by independent counsel retained by the Board to investigate the allegations in the
derivative lawsuits and in a series of shareholder letters that the Board received raising similar issues. Four of the shareholders who sent demands are
plaintiffs in the In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation. The independent counsel recommended that the Company reject the
shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of the derivative lawsuits. The Board unanimously adopted the
recommendations of the independent counsel’s report. In October 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint, and in January 2021, Johnson &
Johnson moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint.
In January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan against Johnson & Johnson, its
Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants
breached their fiduciary duties by offering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do
so because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. Plaintiffs are
seeking damages and injunctive relief. In September 2019, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the Court granted Defendants’ motion but
granted leave to amend. In June 2020, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in July 2020, Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. As of
October 2020, briefing on Defendants’ motion was complete.
A lawsuit pending in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging violations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act
relating to JOHNSON’S Baby Powder has been resolved in the Company’s favor. In that lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that Johnson & Johnson violated the
CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for
the Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the
second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended
complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In
April 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint but indicated
that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a Fifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company
moved to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued an Order
and opinion ruling in the Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice.®

In January 2020, the Abtahi Law Group filed an action under Proposition 65 against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. as well as
a number of other alleged talcum powder manufacturers and distributors, including one California company. In that action, the plaintiff alleges
contamination of talcum powder products with unsafe levels of arsenic, hexavalent chromium and lead. The plaintiff seeks civil penalties and injunctive
relief. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment in January 2021, and a hearing has been scheduled for April 2021. Limited informal discovery is
continuing.
In addition, the Company has received preliminary inquiries and subpoenas to produce documents regarding these matters from Senator Murray, a member
of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the
U.S. Congressional Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. The Company produced documents as required in response and will continue to
cooperate with government inquiries. In November 2020, the SEC terminated its investigation.
Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson &
Johnson, arising out of the use of INVOKANA, a prescription medication indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. In
December 2016, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be
filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has settled or
otherwise resolved many of the cases and claims in the United States and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's
accruals.
Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson &
Johnson, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for the relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial
cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that ELMIRONcontributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both
state and federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, the federal cases, including two putative class action cases seeking medical
monitoring, were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In addition, three class action
lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to
potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established accruals for defense costs associated with ELMIRON related product
liability litigation.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual
property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products
and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial
defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in
any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity,
require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. Significant
matters are described below.

Pharmaceutical
Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)
The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the FDA or undertaken similar regulatory processes
outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson prior to expiration of the
applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In the
event the subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings
are obtained, the third-party companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the
market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash
impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can
involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The Inter Partes Review
(IPR) process with the®

named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations®

that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things,
the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in
calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the
purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of
these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP
Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or
settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after trial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against
Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been resolved.
Opioid Litigation
Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies,
have been named in more than 3,100 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The suits
also raise allegations related to previously owned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc.
(both subsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits have also been filed
by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal
Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI,
have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have
been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina; Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. There are more than
370 cases pending in various state courts. There are over 2,800 federal cases coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (MDL No. 2804). In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit in Canada. In October 2019, an
anti-trust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims
related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and
practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the
plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large
monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.
The trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson & Johnson and JPI in the amount of $572 million,
subject to a final order to be issued by the Court. The Court issued a final judgment reducing the amount to $465 million. Johnson & Johnson and JPI have
appealed the judgment. The Company believes that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment. In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI
announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio.
Johnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing
practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In
September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states
regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the
Company paying $4 billion as settlement of these matters. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in
settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $5 billion
which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement in principle is not an admission of liability or
wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities and counties. The Company cannot predict if or when the agreement
will be finalized and individual cases are ongoing.
In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York for
documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution of its® ® ®

opioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and
reporting under the Controlled Substances Act. In September 2019, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the New York State Department of
Financial Services (NYDFS) as part of an industry-wide inquiry into the effect of opioid prescriptions on New York health insurance premiums. In
September 2020, the Company learned that NYDFS filed a statement of charges related to this investigation.
From June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand letters alleging breaches of fiduciary
duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent counsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020,
independent counsel delivered a report to the Board recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary
or appropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s
report.
In November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and
certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties
related to the marketing of opioids, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In May 2020, the shareholder
filed an amended complaint challenging the Board’s rejection of his demand. In August 2020, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the amended
complaint, and as of December 2020, that motion was fully briefed. In August 2020, another shareholder who sent a demand filed a separate derivative
complaint in the same court making similar allegations. In October 2020, the Court granted defendants’ request to reassign the second-filed case to the
division where the first-filed case is pending.
In December 2019, two additional shareholders who sent demands filed two separate derivative complaints making similar allegations against Johnson &
Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the United States District for the District of New
Jersey. In April 2020, the two federal cases were consolidated into a single action captioned In re Johnson & Johnson Opioid Stockholder Derivative
Litigation. In July 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint. In September 2020, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the consolidated
complaint, and in December 2020, the shareholders opposed Johnson & Johnson’s motion. Johnson & Johnson filed its reply in February 2021. In July
2020, an additional shareholder who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint in the same federal court making similar allegations against the same
defendants named in the consolidated action. In January 2021, pursuant to an order in the consolidated action, the third case was consolidated into the
consolidated action. In February 2021, the shareholders in the consolidated action filed a motion for voluntary dismissal.

In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy)
received an informal request from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States
Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR™ XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States
notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False
Claims Act against the companies. In February 2016, the district court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam
complaint, and denied the qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the
decision to deny the relators’ request to file a third amended complaint. The relators’ remaining claims are now pending before the district court. In July
2020, the Court ordered the relators to complete discovery by August 2020; the Relators have requested an extension of the August 2020 deadline that
DePuy opposed and additional discovery-related motions have been filed by both parties. Additionally, DePuy has requested a schedule for the filing of a
motion to strike and to dismiss the relators’ second amended complaint.
In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of

2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer
protection statutes. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by the following states: Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia and Oregon. In April
2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the Washington case. The California case started trial in July 2019 and concluded in September 2019. The
trial date for the Kentucky case was scheduled for September 2019 but has been adjourned and no new trial date has been scheduled. In October 2019,
Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the multi-state investigation with 41 other states and the District of Columbia. In January 2020, the Court in
California issued a statement of decision, finding in favor of the State of California, and awarded civil penalties in the amount of $344 million. In April
2020, the Court in California denied the Company's motion for a new trial. In August 2020, the Court entered judgment with respect to the penalties of
$344 million, but denied the Attorney General’s request for injunctive relief. The Company is appealing the penalty judgment. In April 2020, the
95
Company settled the West Virginia. In October 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Oregon. In November 2020, the Company settled
with the Attorney General of Mississippi.
In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD)
franchise, received a letter from the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania informing Therakos that
the United States Attorney's Office was investigating the sales and marketing of Uvadex (methoxsalen) and the Uvar Xts and Cellex Systems during the
period 2000 to the present. The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson & Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the
investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013, and OCD was divested in June 2014.
Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson & Johnson retained OCD’s portion of any liability resulting from the investigation for activity that occurred
prior to the sale of Therakos. Following production of documents to and settlement discussions with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, J&J affiliate Medical
Device Business Services, Inc. agreed to resolve claims under the federal False Claims Act and analogous state laws in a settlement announced in
November 2020. In the settlement agreement, Medical Device Business Services expressly denied any wrongful conduct. As a result of the settlement, a
qui tam complaint filed by two relators pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania will be dismissed. Separate settlement
agreements with the states participating in the settlement are in the process of being finalized.
In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against

that defendants violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by
failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S Shower
to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. The matter is stayed pending interlocutory appeal of a December 2018
denial of Johnson & Johnson and JJCI's motion for summary judgment. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted J&J and JJCI's request to file an
interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in late 2019. Briefing is complete and oral argument was held in February 2021.

than 30 companies including Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. The authorities appear to be investigating
allegations of possible anti-competitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry. We continue to actively respond to
inquiries regarding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from the United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission.
From time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to
ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information.

20. Restructuring
In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to
focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio,
enhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce
complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network. For additional details on the Global Supply Chain
restructuring strategic collaborations see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of
$0.4 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.2 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income)
expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.3 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was
announced. See the following table for additional details on the restructuring program.
In total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that
will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, over the
4 to 5 year period of this activity. These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.   
The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through the fiscal year ended 2020:
(Dollars in Millions) Severance Asset Write-offs/Sales Other Total
Reserve balance, December 30, 2018 $ 194 — 48 242 
2019 activity (30) — (32) (62)
Reserve balance, December 29, 2019 164 — 16 180 
Current year activity:
   Charges — 43 405 448 
   Cash settlements (29) 24 (399) (404)
   Settled non cash — (67) (13) (80)
Reserve balance, January 3, 2021 $ 135 — 9 144 
 Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next 2 years in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws.
 Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting these initiatives and consulting expenses.
Relates to pension related net actuarial losses associated with the transfer of employees to Jabil Inc. as part of the strategic collaboration.
 Represents gain on sale of an asset
The Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments due to the planned release of associates
regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing severance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans
given the period over which the actions will take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts
become probable and estimable.(2)

audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 3,
2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
101
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not
alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,
providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
U.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a
contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a
reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance
sheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care,
Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.2 billion as of January 3, 2021. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed
Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience,
patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare
and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing
these reserves and the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to
contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care,
Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i)
developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market,
the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed
by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and
(iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates.
Litigation Contingencies – Talc
As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters,
including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts
have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal
contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions
including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things,
whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete;
proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty
and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and
counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. There have been verdicts against the Company for this matter, including a verdict in July 2018
of $4.7 billion, which was reversed in part and affirmed in part by the Missouri Court of Appeals in June 2020, reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion
and, with additional interest as of January 3, 2021, as the Company pursues further appeal, is currently $2.5 billion. An application for transfer of the case
to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and the Company is currently seeking review by the United States Supreme Court. As described
by management, the Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds for the appeal of this verdict, as well as other verdicts it has appealed.
Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has and may settle cases. The Company
has established an accrual for defense costs and reserves for settlement of certain cases and claims, as well as one case currently on appeal, in connection
with product liability litigation associated with body powders containing talc.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant
judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when
102
determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for each claim can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment,
subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including
controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures.
These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the talc
litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external
counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation;
(iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and
reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.
Litigation – Opioids
As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters,
including opioids, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts
have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal
contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions
including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things,
whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute;
procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party
settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. The Company has been named in numerous
lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to opioids matters. The trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted
in a judgment against the Company in the amount of $572 million which was subsequently reduced to $465 million. The Company has appealed the
judgment and, as described by management, believes that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment. Separately in October 2019, the Company
announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of the lawsuits. In October 2020, the
Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by
states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $5 billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being
finalized. As described by management, this agreement in principle is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed
and future claims by states, cities and counties.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the opioids litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant
judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred for the judgment against the Company in Oklahoma and when
determining whether a reasonable estimate of the range of loss for the proposed agreement in principle to settle opioids litigation can be made, which in
turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss
contingencies associated with this litigation.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the opioid litigation, including
controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures.
These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the opioids
litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and ongoing settlement negotiations with the Company’s in-house
legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal
counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably
possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the
preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021. In
making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
“Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and
communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness
of its internal controls over financial reporting.
Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 3, 2021, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
    Not applicable.
Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
    Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President,
Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Gorsky and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of
the period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
    Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to "Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting", and the attestation regarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the "Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" included in Item 8 of this Report.
    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  During the fiscal quarter ended January 3, 2021, there were no changes in the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company has not
experienced any material impact to its internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that most of its employees are working remotely due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively took actions to re-evaluate and refine its financial reporting process through additional monitoring
controls to provide reasonable assurance that the financial results are reported accurately and timely. The Company continues to monitor and assess the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.
    The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human
resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s
financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and
operation of its financial control environment.

eligible participants, whose benefits under the Consolidated Retirement Plan of Johnson & Johnson (the “CRP”) or the Johnson

limitations imposed by Code Section 415 (limit on annual benefits), Code Section 401(a)(17) (compensation limit) or similar
laws under the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 201 1, as amended.
The Plan was initially ef fective January 1, 1983, and has been subsequently amended from time to time, including to comply with

spinof f of the PR Plan from the CRP. The Plan is now amended and restated, effective January 1, 2020, except as otherwise
provided, to incorporate prior amendments and to include certain clarifications.
Participation in the Plan is limited to a select group of management and highly compensated employees of Johnson & Johnson
and its af filiates.

compensation under a Qualified Plan that exceeds the Statutory Limitation or (b) accruing a benefit under a Qualified

Article IV .
BENEFITS
4.01    Amount of Benefits
. The benefit under the Plan is based on the excess of the amount (if any) that would be payable under the Qualified Plan if not
for the Statutory Limitations over the amount actually payable under the Quali fied Plan. Such benefit may consist of an Excess
FAP Benefit, an Excess R VP Benefit, or both, determined as follows:
(a)    Excess F AP Benefit . To the extent a Participant accrued Qualified Plan benefits under the FAP Form ula, the amount
payable under the Plan (the “Excess FAP Benefit”) is expressed as a monthly amount equal to the excess, if any,
of:
(i)    The monthly  benefit that would have been payable under the Qualified Plan’ s FAP Formula to or on behalf of
the Participant, commencing as of the Payment Start Date, if not for the Statutory Limitations; over
(ii)    The monthly  benefit actually paya ble under the Qualified Plan’ s FAP Formula commencing at the same time
and in the same form (without regard to the Participant’ s actual time or form of payment under the
Qualified Plan).
(b)    Excess R VP Benefit . To the extent a Participant accrued Qualified Plan benefits under the RVP Formula, the amount
payable under the Plan (the “Excess R VP Benefit”) is expressed as a lump sum equal to the excess, if any , of:
(i)    The benefit that would have been payable in a lump sum under the Quali fied Plan’ s RVP Formula to or on
behalf of the Participant, commencing as of the Payment Start Date, if not for the Statutory Limitations;
over
(ii)    The benefit actually payable under the Qualified Plan’ s RVP Formula at the same time and in the same form
(without regard to the Participant’ s actual time or form of payment under the Qualified Plan).
4.02    Time and Form of Payment
(a)    Excess FAP Benefit . If a Parti cipant has a Grandfathered Benefit, such Grandfathered Benefit shall be paid at the
same time and in the same form as the Participant’ s benefit under the Qualified Plan, unless some other form of
payment is authoriz ed by the Plan Administrator in accordance with terms of the Plan in effect on October 3,
2004. The Participant’ s FAP 409A Benefit, if any, shall be paid in the annuity form prescribed by subsection (c),
below , commencing  on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the later of the Participant’ s
55 birthday or the Participant’ s Separation From Service; provided, however , that theth
6
FAP 409A Benefit for a former Pfizer Consumer who was eligible to receive a lump sum under the Pfizer plan
shall be paid in a lump sum.
(b)    Excess RVP Benefit . Except as provided below in the event of death, a Participant’ s Excess RVP Benefit shall be
paid in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month after the Participant’ s Separation From Service.
(c)    Annuity Form for FAP 409A Benefit . Unless otherwise elected by the Particip ant in accordance with this subsection
(c), the annuity form for a Participant’ s FAP 409A Benefit shall be (I) a single life annuity if the Participant is not
treated as married under the Qualified Plan as of the Payment Start Date, or (II) an actuarially equivalent joint and
50% surviving spouse annuity if the Participant is treated as married under the Qualified Plan as of the Payment
Start Date. A Participant may elect in writing, in such manner at such times as permitted by the Plan Administrator
to receive the FAP 409A Benefit in any actuarially equivalent annuity form of payment that is available under the
Qualified Plan, other than the Level Income Options, provided that such election satisfies each of the following
conditions:
(i)    The change in the form of payment complies with T reas. Reg. Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(ii); and
(ii)    The Plan Administrator receives the Participant’ s election before the Payment Start Date; and
(iii)    The Participant’ s election is complete and in good order , as determined by the Plan Administrator .
Actuarial equivalence shall be determined using the assumptions prescribed by the Qualified Plan.
4.03    Automatic Cash-Out of Small Benefits
If the actuarial present value of a Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, FAP 409A Benefit, or Excess RVP Benefit (or,
following the Participant’ s death, the actuarial present value of the Beneficiary’ s death benefit) is less than $5,000 as of
the applica ble Payment Start Date, such benefit (or, if applicable, the Beneficiary’ s total benefit) shall be paid in a lump
sum on the applicable Payment Start Date. For purposes of this rule, actuarial present value shall be calculated using the
Qualified Plan’ s actuarial assumptions for small benefit cash-outs (as in ef fect as of the applicable determination date).
7
4.04    Rehir ed Participants
If a Participant has a Separation From Service and is later rehired by an Employer , the following rules shall apply:
(a)    If the Participant had earned a vested benefit under the Plan at the time of his first Separation From Service, the
vested benefit that the Participant had earned at the time of his first Separation  From Service shall be paid at the
same time and in the same form as if the Participant had not returned to service; provided that Grandfathered
Benefits shall be subject to the suspension rules that were in effect as of Octob er 3, 2004. Any additional vested
benefit that the Participant earns after his return to service shall be paid as provided in the Plan upon his
subsequent Separation From Service or death, without regard to his first Separation From Service.
(b)    If the Participa nt had not earned a vested benefit under the Plan at the time of his first Separation From Service, but
the Participant returns to service with an Employer and earns a vested bene fit after his return to service, the
Participant’ s vested benefit under the Plan shall be paid as provided in the Plan upon his subsequent Separation
From Service or death, without regard to his first Separation From Service.
(c)    The break-in-s ervice rules and other terms of the Qualified Plan shall determine to what extent (if at all) any service
or compensation the Participant had earned at the time of his first Separation From Service is forfeited or is taken
into account in calculating the amount of the Participant’ s benefit under the Plan after his return to service.
8
Article V .
VESTING
Benefits under the Plan shall be subject to the same vesting conditions as apply under the Qualified Plan. If a Participant has a
Separation From Service before his benefit under the Qualified Plan is fully vested, no benefit shall be payable under this Plan
with respect to the unvested portion.
9
Article VI.
DISABILITY AND DEA TH
6.01    Disability
If a Partic ipant continues to accrue benefits under the Qualified Plan’ s disabilit y provisions after the Payment Start Date
required by this Plan, payment of the Participant’ s Plan benefit shall commence  as of the Payment Start Date required by
this Plan (which, in the case of benefits under the FAP Formula, shall be calculated based on a projection of the Statutory
Limitations under the Qualified Plan) and such additional accruals shall be paid (a) if accrued under the FAP Formula,
when the Participan t stops accruing benefits under the Qualified Plan, and (b) if accrued under the RVP Formula, on an
annual basis. Such additional disability accruals, if any, are intended to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A
of the Code by reason of being disability pay under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A -1(a)(5). This provision shall be construed
and administered consistently with the intent to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code while
providing a total benefit under this Plan and the Qualified Plan combined that has the same value as the benefit that would
be payable under the Qualified Plan if not for the Statutory Limitations.
6.02    Death
If a Participant dies before the Payment Start Date prescribed by the Plan, the only benefit payable under the Plan to or on
behalf of such Partic ipant shall be a death benefit under this Section 6.02. Such death benefit shall be the excess, if any, of
the death benefit that would be payable under the Qualified Plan if not for the Statutory Limitations over the actual death
benefit payable under the Qualified Plan, subject to the following rules:
(a)    FAP Formula .
(i)    If the Particip ant is treated as married under the Qualified Plan as of the date of his death, the only death
benefit with respect to the FAP Formula  shall be the excess, if any, of the pre-pe nsion survivor annuity that
would be payable under the Qualified Plan if not for the Statutory Limitations over the pre-retirement
survivor annuity that is actually payable  under the Qualified Plan at the same time and in the same form
(without regard to the actual time or form of payment under the Qualified Plan). Payment shall begin as of
the later of the first day of the month coincident with or next following the later of the Participant’ s death
or the date the Participant would have attained age 55. For purposes of the Plan, any election to waive the
pre-pension survivor annuity under the Qualified Plan shall be disregarded.
(ii)    If the Participant is not treated as married under the Qualified Plan as of the date of his death, no death
benefit shall be payable under the Plan unless
10
the Participant qualifies for a 60-Mon th Survivor Pension under the Qualifi ed Plan. If the Participant
qualifies for a 60-M onth Survivor Pension  under the Qualified Plan, the Participa nt’s Beneficiary shall
receive a corresponding monthly benefit under this Plan, commencing as of the first day of the month
coincident with or next following the Participant’ s death, in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
monthly benefit that would be payable under the Qualified Plan if not for the Statutory Limitations (and if
such death benefit under the Qualified Plan were payable on a monthly basis) over the actual monthly
benefit payable unde r the Qualified Plan (determined without regard to Qualified Plan provisions requiring
payment in a lump sum or other form). If the Beneficiary dies prior to receiving all 60 payments, the
remaining payments  shall be paid to the secondary Beneficiary named by the Participant, if any, or else to
the designated Beneficiary’ s estate.
(b)    RVP Formula . If a Participant dies before the payment  date prescribed by Section 4.02(b) (“Excess RVP Benefit”),
the Participant’ s Excess RVP Benefit (if any) shall be paid to his Beneficiary in a lump sum as of the first day of
the month coincident with or next following the Participant’ s death.
(c)    Actual Payment Date for Death Benefit s. Payment of death benefits may be delayed, without interest, to the extent
the Plan Administrator determines to be necessary to identify the Beneficiary and arrange for payment, provided
that payme nt is made by December 31 of the first calendar year that starts after the Participant’ s death or such later
date as may be permitted by IRS guidance under Code Section 409A.

policies of insurance.
7.02    Top-Hat Plan Status
