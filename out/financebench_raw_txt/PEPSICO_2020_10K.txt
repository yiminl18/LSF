and closures. We expect that the COVID -19 pandemic will continue to impact our business operations, including our employees,
customers, consume rs, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint ventu re partners, suppliers and other third parties with
which we do business. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our future business operations and financial
results remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors outside our control.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for discus sion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, see
“Our Business Risks” in Item 7. Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 financial
results.
Our Distribution Network
Our products are primarily brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD), customer warehouse and distributor networks
and are also sold directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms and retailers. The distribution system used depends on
customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices.
Direct-Store-Delivery
We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages, foods and snacks directly to retail
stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independe nt bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with
maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store
promotion and merchandising.
Customer W arehouse
Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, both company and third-party
operated, to custome r warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable,
and have lower turnover .
Distributor Networks
We distrib ute many  of our products through third-party distributors. Third-p arty distributors are particularly effective when
greater distribution reach can be achiev ed by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our
foodservice and vending business distributes beverages, foods and snacks to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums
through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.
E-commerce
Our produ cts are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-
commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.
Ingredients and Other Supplies
The princi pal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice
concentrates, asparta me, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour , grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk,
rice, seaso nings, sucralose, sugar , vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our
products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene
resins used for plastic beverage bottles  and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and
paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the
increased use of recycled content, inclu ding recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important
commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our
products. W e employ specialists to secure

Table of Contents
adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us
from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The
prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and
purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of
certain raw materials is mitigated throug h purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or
may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and
resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by
our suppli ers and expanding it further globally . See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on
how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.
We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions, pursuant to
which our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to such global financial
institutions. These agreements have not had a material impact on our business or financial results. See “Our Financial Results –
Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7. Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for further information.

brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest
either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. Trademarks remain valid so long as
they are used proper ly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through
licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling
appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand
awareness.
We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certa in of our products, their packaging, the processes
for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed
to others.

Seasonality
Our busin esses are affected by seasonal variations. Our beverage, food and snack sales are generally highest in the third quarter
due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter . However , taken as a whole, seasonality has
not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results.
Our Customers
Our custom ers inclu de wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores,
discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized
independent bottlers , among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture
certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right
to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process
required for product  quality . We also grant distribution rights to our independe nt bottlers for certain beverage products bearing
our trademarks for specified geographic areas.
We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the
consumer . For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees,
promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated
annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support,
new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and
promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent
bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as
point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs
support the acquisition and placement  of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary
annually .
Changes to the retail landscape, includ ing increased consolidation of retail ownership, the rapid growth of sales through e-
commerce websites  and mobile comme rce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer
businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard
discounters, and the current economic environment, including in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to increase the
importance of major customers. In 2020, sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and its affiliates, including Sam’ s Club (Sam’ s),
represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including
concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this
customer would have a material adverse ef fect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions.
See “Off-Balance-S heet Arrangements” in “Our Financial Results – Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7.
Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information on our
independent bottlers.
Our Competition
Our bever age, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of
international bevera ge, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and
private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors, inclu ding smaller companies developing and selling
micro brands directl y to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In
many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage
competitor . Other beverage, food and snack competitors include, but are not limited to,
7
Table of Contents
Campbell Soup Company , Conagra Brands, Inc., Kellogg Company , Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company , Link
Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc.
Many of our food and snack products hold significant leadership positions in the food and snack industry in the United States and
worldwide. In 2020, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 22% and 20%, respectively , of the U.S. liquid
refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured chan nels, according to Information Resources, Inc.
However , The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the
United States.
Our bever age, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty , taste, price, value,
quality , product variety , innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging,
convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased
consumer focus on health and wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and
purchasing products . Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective
introduction of new products and reformulations of existing products, increased efficiency in production techniques, effective
incorporation of technology and digital tools across all areas of our business, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns,
marketing program s, product packaging and pricing, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark
development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innov ation and marketing, coupled with the quality of
our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete ef fectively .
Resear ch and Development
We engage in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting the
needs of our custom ers and consumers and accelerating growth. These activi ties principally involve: innovations focused on
creating consumer preferred products to grow and transform our portfolio through development of new technologies, ingredients,
flavors and substrates; development and improvement of our manufacturing processes including reductions in cost and
environmental footp rint; implementing  product improvements to our global portfolio that reduce added sugars, sodium or
saturated fat; offering more products with functional ingredients and positive nutrition including whole grains, fruit, vegetables,
dairy , protein, fiber, micronutrients and hydration; development of packaging technology and new package designs, including
reducing the amount of plastic in our packaging and developing recyclable and sustainable packaging; development of marketing,
merchandising and dispensing equipment; further expanding our beyond the bottle portfolio including innovation for our
SodaStream business; investments in technology and digitalization including data analytics to enhance our consumer insights and
research; continuing  to strengthen our omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce; and efforts focused on reducing our
impact on the environment including reducing water use in our operations and our agricultural practices.
Our research centers are located around  the world, including in Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the
United Kingdom and the United States , and leverage consumer insights, food science and engineering to meet our strategy to
continually innovate our portfolio of convenient foods and beverages.
Regulatory Matters
The conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display , advertising, marketing, labeling,
content, quality , safety, transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and
occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information, are subject to various laws and regulations

regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity , such as the Equal
Employment Opport unity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the Fair
Labor Standards Act; data privacy and personal data protection laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy
Act of 2018; custom s and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or
ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws regulating the sale of certain  of our products in schools; laws regulating our
supply chain, including the 2010 Califor nia Transparency in Supply Chains Act and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are
also requir ed to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act.
We are also subjec t to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as
Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the
State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is
below a safe harbor level.
We are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws
and regulations governing food safety , international trade and tariffs, supply chain, including the U.K. Modern Slavery Act,
occupational health  and safety , competition, anti-corruption and data privacy , including the European Union General Data
Protection Regulatio n. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our
competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruptio n laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely
on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses
in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.
In addition , certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture,
distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in
the production of our products. These  taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric
beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g.,  sugar). Similarly , some measures apply a single
tax rate per ounce/l iter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a
graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweeten er) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate
on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the level of such substance or ingredient.
In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or
other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such
products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we highlight perceived
concerns about a product, warn consum ers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products,
restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available.
It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.

In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates
or encourage waste reduction. These regulations vary in scope and form from deposit return systems designed to incentivize the
return of beverage containers, to extend ed producer responsibility policies and even bans on the use of some types of single-use
plastics. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.
We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do
business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater dischar ge and air emissions. In the United
States, our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding
handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed
facilities and our facilities outside the United States must comply with simil ar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing
concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory  requirements (in or outside of the United States)
to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due
to local water scarci ty concerns. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal
programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary
expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While these expenditures have not had a
material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance
requirements, and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial
performance. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal
course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities
and contr actual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental
remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty , such obligations have not had, and are not
expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
In addition to the discussion in this section, see also “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Human Capital
PepsiCo believes that human capital management, including attracting, developing and retaining a high quality workforce, is
critical to our long-term success. Our Board and its Committees provide oversight on a broad range of human capital
management topics, including corporate  culture, diversity and inclusion, pay equity , health and safety , training and development
and compensation and benefits.
We emplo yed appro ximately 291,000 people worldwide as of December 26, 2020, including approximately 120,000 people
within the United States. We are party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and believe that relations with our
employees are generally good.
Protecting the safety , health, and well-b eing of our associates around the world is PepsiCo’ s top priority . We strive to achieve an
injury-free work environment. We also continue to invest in emer ging technologies to protect our employees from injuries,
including leveraging fleet telematics and distracted driving technology , resulting in reductions in road traffic accidents, and
deploying wearable ergonomic risk reduction devices. In addition, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained
focused on the healt h and safety of our associates, especially our frontline associates who continue to make, move and sell our
products during this critical time, including by implementing new safety protocols in our facilities, providing personal protective
equipment and enabling testing.
We believe that our culture of diversity  and inclusion is a competitive advantage that fuels innovation, enhances our ability to
attract and retain talent and strengthens our reputation. W e continually strive to
10
Table of Contents
improve the attraction, retention, and advancement of diverse associates to ensure we sustain a high-caliber pipeline of talent that
also represents the communities we serve. As of December 26, 2020, our global workforce was approximately 25% female, while
management roles were approximately 41% female. As of December 26, 2020 , approximately 43% of our U.S. workforce was
comprised of racially/ethnically diverse individuals, of which approximately 30% of our U.S. associates in managerial roles were
racially/ethnically diverse individuals. Direct reports of our Chief Executive  Officer include 7 executives globally who are
racially/ethnically diverse and/or female.
We are also committed to the continued growth and development of our associates. PepsiCo supports and develops its associates
through a variety of global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees' leadership and professional
skills, including career development plans, mentoring programs and in-house learning opportunities, such as PEP U Degreed, our
internal global online learning resource. In 2020, PepsiCo employees completed over 875,000 hours of training.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The following risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occu r in the future, can have a material adverse effect
on our business or financial performanc e, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. These are not the
only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but may
become material in the future.
COVID-19 Risks
The impact of COVID-19 continues to create considerable uncertainty for our business.
Our global operations continue to expos e us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Authorities around the world have
implemented numerous measures to try to reduce the spread of the virus and such measures have impacted and continue to
impact us, our busin ess partners and consumers. While some of these measures have been lifted or eased in certain jurisdictions,
other jurisdictions have seen a resur gence of COVID-19 cases resulting in reinstitution or expansion of such measures.
11
Table of Contents
We have seen and could continue to see changes in consumer demand as a result of COVID-19, including the inability of
consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other restrictions, store closures, or financial hardship. We also
continue to see shifts in product and channel prefe rences, particularly an increase in demand in the e-commerce channel, which
has impacted and could continue to impact our sales and profitability . Reduced demand for our products or changes in consumer
purchasing patterns,  as well as continued economic uncertainty , can adversely affect our customers’ financial condition, which
can result  in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products. In addition, we may also continue to experience
business disruptions as a result of COVID-19, resulting from temporary closu res of our facilities or facilities of our business
partners or the inabi lity of a significant portion of our or our business partners’ workforce to work because of illness, quarantine,
or travel or other governmental restrictions. Any sustained interruption in our or our business partners’ operations, distribution
network or supply chain or any significant continuous shortage of raw material s or other supplies, including personal protective
equipment or sanitization products, can negatively impact our business. We have also incurred, and expect to continue to incur ,
increased employee and operating costs as a result of COVID-19, such as costs related to expanded benefits and frontline
incentives, the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, allowances for credit losses, upfront payment
reserves and inventory write-of fs, which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our profitability . In
addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information
technology infrastructure, which can be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability , and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks
and other cyber incidents. Also, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in
volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability  to access these markets on terms commercially
acceptable to us, or at all.
The impact of COV ID-19 has heightened, or in some cases manifested, certain of the other risks discussed herein. The extent of
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving
factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdic tion and market, including the duration and scope
of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, global economic conditions during and
after the pandemic, governmental action s that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic, and
changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary .
Business Risks
Reduction in future demand for our products would adversely af fect our business.
Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and
preferences, includi ng the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for, purchase and consume them.
Consumer preferences continuously evolve due to a variety of factors, including: changes in consumer demographics,
consumption patterns and channel preferences (including continued rapid increases in the e-commerce and online-to-of fline
channels); pricing; product quality; concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact (such as single-use
and other plastic packaging); and concerns or perceptions regarding the nutri tion profile and health effects of, or location of
origin of, ingredients or substances in our products. Concerns with any of the foregoing could lead consumers to reduce or
publicly boycott the purchase or consum ption of our products. Consumer preferences are also influenced by perception of our
brand image or the brand images of our products, the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, our ability to engage
with our consumers in the manner they prefer , including through the use of digital media, and the perception of our use, and the
use of social media.  These and other factors have reduced in the past and could continue to reduce consumers’ willingness to
purchase certain of our products. Any inability on our part to anticipate
12
Table of Contents
or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strateg ic investments to do so, including investments in
data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our products, lead to inventory write-of fs or erode
our competitive and financial position, thereby adversely affecting our business. In addition, our business operations are subject
to disrupt ion by natural disasters or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and
decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not ef fectively resolve these issues.
Damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely af fect our business.
Maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been,
and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including: any failure by us or our business partners to
maintain high ethical, social, business and environmental practices, including with respect to human rights, child labor laws and
workplace condition s and employee health and safety; any failure to achieve our sustainability goals, including with respect to
the nutrition profile of our products, packaging, water use and our impact on the environment; any failure to address health
concerns about our products or particular ingredients in our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our
products contribute to obesity; our research and development efforts; any product quality or safety issues, including the recall of
any of our product s; any failure to comply with laws and regulations; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns,
sponsorship arrange ments, marketing programs and use of social media; or any failure to effectively respond to negative or
inaccurate comment s about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation or brand
image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely af fecting our business.
Issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely af fect our business.
Product quality or safety issues, including alleged mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, undeclared allergens, adulteration or
contamination, whether as a result of failure to comply with food safety laws or otherwise, have in the past and could in the
future reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products, cause production and delivery disruptions, require product
recalls and result in increased costs (including payment of fines and/or judgments) and damage our reputation, all of which can
adversely affect our business. Failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety can result in product recalls,
litigation, government investigations or inquiries or civil or criminal proceedings, all of which may result in fines, penalties,
damages or criminal liability . Our busin ess can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality , safety
and integrity generally , even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio.
Any inability to compete ef fectively can adversely af fect our business.
Our products compete against products of international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple
geographies, as well as regional, local and private label and economy brand manufacturers and other competitors, including
smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers
focused on locally sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-
Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor . Our products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty ,
taste, price , value, quality , product varie ty, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity , packaging,
convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends. Our business can
be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively promote or develop our existing products or introduce new products, if our
competitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to pricing pressure or
compete effectively , and we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital,
marketing or other expenditures.

Table of Contents
Failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce can have an adverse ef fect on our business.
Our busin ess requires that we attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Our employees are highly
sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to
attract, retain, deve lop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Any unplanned turnover or
unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive
Officer, or failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including with key capabilities such as
e-commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills, can deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive
advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased
employee benefit costs. In addition, failure to attract, retain and develop associates from underrepresented communities can
damage our business results and our reputation. Any of the foregoing can adversely af fect our business.
Water scarcity can adversely af fect our business.
We and our business  partners use water in the manufacturing and sourcing of our products. Lack of available water of acceptable
quality , increasing focus by governmen tal and non-governmental organization s, investors, customers and consumers on water
scarcity and increas ing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to: supply chain
disruption; adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our business partners; higher compliance costs; capital
expenditures (including investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce consumption);
higher production costs, including less favorable pricing for water; the interruption or cessation of operations at, or relocation of,
our facilities or the facilities of our business partners; failure to achieve our sustainability goals relating to water use; perception
of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to legal or regulatory requirements concerning
water scarcity; or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely af fect our business.
Changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer can adversely af fect our business.
The retail landscape  continues to evolve, including rapid growth in e-commerce channels and hard discounters. Our business will
be adversely affected if we are unable  to maintain and develop successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard
discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom
are also focused on increasing their e-commerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard
discounters take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers or we fail to find ways to create more
powerful digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses. In addition, our business
can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. The retail
industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power , particularly in North America, Europe
and Latin  America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power , impacting our ability to
compete in these areas. Consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers’ ability to compete ef fectively , resulting in an
inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further , we must maintain mutually
beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Walmart, to compete effectively . Any inability to resolve a significant
dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers,
even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer , or the loss of any of our key customers can adversely
affect our business.

Table of Contents
Disruption of our supply chain may adversely af fect our business.
Many of the raw materials and supplie s used in the production of our produc ts are sourced from countries experiencing civil
unrest, political instability or unfavorab le economic conditions. Some raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials
such as recycled PET, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when
seasonal demand is at its peak. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and
relationships with suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages or
discontinuation of any raw materials and other supplies that we use in the manufacture, production and distribution of our
products. The raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commod ities and fuel, that we use for the manufacturing,
production and distribution of our products are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors,
including changes in supply and demand, weather conditions (including potential effects of climate change), fire, natural
disasters, disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty , health
epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export
restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), political uncertainties, acts of terrorism,
governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market.
The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. If price changes result in unexpected or significant increases in the
costs of any raw materials or other suppl ies, we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively
hedge against price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating
results.
Political and social conditions can adversely af fect our business.
Political and social conditions in the markets in which our products are sold have been and could continue to be difficult to
predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including
government shutdowns) in these markets, including the United Kingdom’ s withd rawal from the European Union, have in the past
and could continue to impact how exist ing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or result in
uncertainty as to how such laws, regulations, programs or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions,
environmental and climate change regulations, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between
countries, relationships between countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other
matters, and has resulted in and could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global
economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand for our products, any of whic h can adversely affect our business. In addition,
political and social conditions in certain cities throughout the U.S. as well as globally have resulted in demonstrations and
protests, including in connection with political elections and civil rights and liberties. Our operations, including the distribution of
our produc ts and the ingredients or other raw materials used in the production of our products, may be disrupted if such events
persist for a prolong ed period of time, including due to actions taken by governmental authorities in affected cities and regions,
which can adversely af fect our business.
Our business can be adversely af fected if we are unable to grow in developing and emerging markets.
Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emer ging markets, including Mexico, Russia,
the Middl e East, Brazil, China, South Africa and India. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted or be
successful in any particular developing or emer ging market, due to competition, price, cultural dif ferences, consumer preferences,
method of distribution or otherwise. Our business in these markets has been and could continue in the future to be impacted by
economic, political and social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest, including demonstrations and protests;
competition; tarif fs, sanctions or other regulations restricting contact with
15
Table of Contents
certain countries in these markets; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our business
partners; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operati ons or the operations of our business partners;
restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or subst ances used in our products; highly inflationary
economies; devaluation or fluctuation or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign
countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries,
from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can
result in the deconso lidation of such businesses; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing
business due to compliance with comp lex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations,
including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act;
and advers e consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with laws and regulations. Our
business can be adversely affected if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emer ging markets, effectively
operate, or manage the risks associated  with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our
investments in these markets.
Changes in economic conditions can adversely impact our business.
Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or
unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns, which have and could continue to result in adverse
changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity marke ts; highly inflationary economies, devaluation,
fluctuation or demonetization; contraction in the availability of credit; demonetization, austerity or stimulus measures; the effects
of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are sold; or a decrease in the fair
value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our
pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how curren t or future economic conditions will affect our
business partners, including financial institutions with whom we do business, and any negative impact on any of the foregoing
may also have an adverse impact on our business.
Future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems can adversely af fect our business.
We depen d on information systems and technology , including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities
important to our business, including communications within our company , interfacing with customers and consumers; ordering
and managing inventory; managing and operating our facilities; protecting confidential information; maintaining accurate
financial records and complying with regulatory , financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our business has in the past and
could in the future be negatively affected by system shutdowns, degraded systems performance, systems disruptions or security
incidents. These disruptions or incident s may be caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, network or power outages,
software, equipment or telecommunicat ions failures, the unintentional or malic ious actions of employees or contractors, natural
disasters, fires or other catastrophic events. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently , are constantly
evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of
expertise and motives. Cyberattacks and cyber incidents take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social
engineering, introduction of viruses or malware, exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking,
website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency
mining and business email compromise. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber
incidents, including many of the types of attacks and incidents described above.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the
resources necessary to continue to build and maintain our information technology infrastructure, or if
16
Table of Contents
we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, our business can be adversely
affected, resulting in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and
the loss of sales and customers.
Similar risks exist with respect to third-party providers, including cloud-based service providers, that we rely upon for aspects of
our information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan
administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and the systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by such
third partie s and their vendors. The need  to coordinate with various third-party service providers, including with respect to timely
notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to resolve issues that
arise. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party service providers can adversely
affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information.
Although the cyber incidents and other systems disruptions that we have experie nced to date have not had a material effect on our
business, such incidents or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. While we devote significant
resources to network security , disaster recovery , employee training and other security measures to protect our systems and data,
there are no assuranc es that such measures will protect us against all cyber incidents or systems disruptions. In addition, while we
currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain
aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and
circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our
reputation or brands that may result from an incident.
Failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely af fect our business.
We regula rly review  our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements,
divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions is dependent upon, among other
things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or syner gies as a result of a transaction,
within the anticipated time frame, or at all; receipt of necessary consent s, clearances and approvals; and diversion of
management’ s atten tion from day-to-day operations. Risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating
manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information
technology systems with our company; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating,
recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting
and disclosure controls and procedures ) and policies (including with respect to environmental compliance, health and safety
compliance and compliance with anti-b ribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers
and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our
supply or sales chain; managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that
may have different interests than we do; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and
litigation. Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively , or our failure to effectively manage
the risks associated with such transactions, have in the past and could continue to result in adverse ef fects on our business.
Our reliance on third-party service providers can have an adverse ef fect on our business.
We rely on third-pa rty service providers, including cloud data service provid ers, for certain areas of our business, including
payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions. Failure by these third
parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance,
has in the past and could
17
Table of Contents
continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings or efficiencies and result in additional costs to correct
errors made by such service providers.  Depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead to business disruption,
systems performance degradation, processing inefficiencies or other systems disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual
property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation or
remediation costs, damage to our reputa tion or have a negative impact on employee morale, all of which can adversely affect our
business.
In addition, we continue on our multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our
financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources
necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from
this initiative, our business could be adversely af fected.
Climate change or measures to address climate change can negatively af fect our business or damage our reputation.
Climate change may have a negative effect on agricultural productivity which may result in decreased availability or less
favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes, sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats,
oranges and other fruits (and fruit-derive d oils). In addition, climate change may also increase the frequency or severity of natural
disasters and other extreme weather conditions, which could impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or
impact demand for our products. Also, concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory
requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change, which could  result in significant increased costs and require
additional investmen ts in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business
and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception
of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectivel y respond to regulatory requirements concerning
climate change can lead to adverse publicity , resulting in an adverse ef fect on our business or damage to our reputation.
Strikes or work stoppages can cause our business to suf fer.
Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by
collective bargaining  agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions can occur if we are unable to renew ,
or enter into new, collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms and can impair manufacturing and distribution of our
products, lead to a loss of sales, increase  our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to
enhance our ef ficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy , all of which can adversely af fect our business.
Financial Risks
Failure to realize benefits from our productivity initiatives can adversely af fect our financial performance.
Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including implementing
shared business service or ganizational models. W e continue to identify and implement productivity initiatives that we believe will
position our business for long-term susta inable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure, improve decision-making
and operate more efficiently . Some of these measures result in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction
of management and employees, reduced morale and productivity , unexpected employee attrition, an inability to attract or retain
key personnel and negative publicity . If we are unable to successfully implemen t our productivity initiatives as planned or do not
achieve expected savings as a
18
Table of Contents
result of these initia tives, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, resulting in adverse effects on our financial
performance.
A deterior ation in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our business can result in
an impairment charge that can adversely af fect our results of operations.
We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if
circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. In addition, amortizable intangible assets, property , plant and
equipment and other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. A deterioration in our underlying assumptions regarding the impact of competitive operating conditions,
macroeconomic conditions or other factors used to estimate the future performance of any of our reporting units or assets,
including any deterioration in the weigh ted-average cost of capital based on market data available at the time, can result in an
impairment, which can adversely af fect our results of operations.
Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our financial performance.
Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside
the United  States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar , are translated into U.S. dollars. Given our global
operations, we also pay for the ingred ients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous currencies.
Fluctuations in exchange rates, includin g as a result of currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions have had, and
could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial performance.
Our borro wing costs and access to capital and credit markets can be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential
downgrade of our credit ratings.
Rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability ,
levels of indebtedne ss, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally , as well as factors
beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry . We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access,
which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest
rates. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, especially any
downgrade to below investment grade, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit
markets on terms commercially accepta ble to us or at all, result in a reduction in our liquidity , or impair our ability to access the
commercial paper market with the same  flexibility that we have experienced historically (and therefore require us to rely more
heavily on more expensive types of debt financing), all of which can adversely af fect our financial performance.
Legal, T ax and Regulatory Risks
Taxes aimed at our products can adversely af fect our business or financial performance.
Certain jurisdictions  in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on
the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of the ingredients or
substances containe d in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric
beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g.,  sugar). Similarly , some measures apply a single
tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a
graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweeten er) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate
on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example, Poland enacted a graduated tax on all
sweetened beverages, effective January  1, 2021, at a rate of PLN 0.5 (USD 0.12) per liter for drinks with a sugar (or other
sweetener) content of up to 5g per 100ml and an additional PLN 0.05 (USD 0.01) for each gram of sugar (or other sweetener)
over 5g . These tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of certain
19
Table of Contents
of our products, reduce overall consumption of our products or lead to negative publicity , resulting in an adverse effect on our
business and financial performance.
Limitations on the marketing or sale of our products can adversely af fect our business and financial performance.
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, limitations on the
marketing or sale of our products as a result of ingredients or substances in our products. These limitations require that we
highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present
in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products
may be available. For example, Mexico has imposed a stop-sign labeling schem e to signal the presence of non-caloric sweeteners
and caffeine in pre-p ackaged foods and non-alcoholic beverages. Certain jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing
color -coded labeling requirements where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular
ingredient, such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat, in products. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional limitations on
the marketing or sale of our products has in the past and could continue to reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to
negative publicity or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting
in an adverse ef fect on our business and financial performance.
Laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging can adversely affect our business and
financial performance.
Certain of our products are sold in plastic or other packaging designed to be recyclable. However , not all packaging is recycled,
whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise, and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable. Packaging waste that
displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity or reduced
consumer demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial performance. Many jurisdictions in which our products are
sold have imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable packaging,
waste reduction or increased recycling rates or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These regulations vary
in form and scope and include taxes to incentivize behavior , restrictions on certain products and materials, requirements for bottle
caps to be tethered to bottles, bans on the use of single-use plastics, extended producer responsibility policies and requirements to
charge deposit fees. For example, the European Union has imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottles
packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in several states in the United States. These laws and regulations have in
the past and could continue to increase the cost of our products, impact demand for our products, result in negative publicity and
require us and our business partners, including our independent bottlers, to increase our capital expenditures to invest in
minimizing the amount of plastic or other materials used in our packaging or to develop alternative packaging, all of which can
adversely af fect our business and financial performance.
Failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely af fect our business.
We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding
personal data protec tion and privacy laws. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to
country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Our efforts to
comply with these laws and regulations,  including with respect to data from residents of the European Union who are covered by
the General Data Protection Regulation or residents of the state of Californi a who are covered by the California Consumer
Privacy Act, impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to continu e to increase over time. Failure to comply with
these laws and regulations can result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations or damage to
our reputation, all of which can adversely af fect our business.

Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreement s with tax authorities can adversely affect our
financial performance.
Increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced,
can advers ely affect our financial perfor mance. For example, economic and political conditions in countries where we are subject
to taxes, including the United States, have in the past and could continue to result in significant changes in tax legislation or
regulation, includin g as a result of any changes enacted during the new U.S. presidential administration. The increasingly
complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty , resulting in higher compliance
costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by
numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax
revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make
resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical
provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse ef fect on our financial performance.
If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are found to infringe on the intellectual
property rights of others, our business can be adversely af fected.
We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, includ ing ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights,
patents, business processes and other trade secrets. The laws of various jurisdict ions in which we operate have differing levels of
protection of intellectual property . Our competitive position and the value of our products and brands can be reduced and our
business adversely affected if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property , including our ingredient formulas,
or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections afforded our intellectual property . Also, if, in the
course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we are found to have infringed on the
intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly , such finding can damage our reputation and limit our ability to
introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products, resulting in an adverse ef fect on our business.
Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business can adversely af fect our business.
The condu ct of our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale,
display , advertising, marketing, labelin g, content (including whether a produ ct contains genetically engineered ingredients),
quality , safety , transportation, traceability , packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, employment and occupational
health and safety , environmental matters (including pesticide use) and data privacy and protection. In addition, in many
jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position, as is compliance
with anti-corruption laws. The imposition of new laws, changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations
thereof, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products are made, manufactured,
distributed or sold, have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher
production costs, resulting in adverse effects on our business. In addition, if one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new
laws or regulations that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, other jurisdictions can often follow . Failure
to comply  with such laws or regulations can subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines, injunctions,
product recalls, penalties, disgor gement of profits or activity restrictions, all of which can adversely af fect our business.

Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an
adverse impact on our business.
We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations,
including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and
ingredients, intellectual property rights, environmental, privacy , employment, tax and insurance matters and matters relating to
our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we
will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or
potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. Responding to these
matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources,
and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our
business.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
We have received no written comments  regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180
days or more preceding the end of our 2020 year and that remain unresolved.

contract manufactur ers, co-packers, strategic alliances or joint ventures in which we have an equity interest. We believe that our
properties generally are in good operati ng condition and, taken as a whole, are suitable, adequate and of sufficient capacity for
our current operations.
Item 3. Legal Pr oceedings.
We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations.

OUR BUSINESS
Executive Overview
PepsiCo is a leading global food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Frito-Lay ,
Gatorade, Pepsi-Col a, Quaker and Tropicana. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third
parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and
consumers in more than 200 countries and territories
Everything we do is driven by an approach we call Winning with Purpose. Winning with Purpose is our guide for achieving
accelerated, sustaina ble growth that includes our mission, to Create More Smiles with Every Sip and Every Bite; our vision, to
Be the Global Leader in Convenient Foods and Beverages by Winning with Purpose; and The PepsiCo Way, seven behaviors that
define our shared culture.
This appro ach prove d prescient and powerful in 2020 as we faced a worsening climate crisis, renewed calls for racial equality ,
and the first global pandemic in a century . Life in communities around the world was transformed, and our business was tested
like never before. First and foremost, we had to protect the health of our associates, so that we could continue to serve our
consumers, customers and communities. At the same time, we had to secure our supply chain; ensure continuity in
manufacturing, distribution and sales; further strengthen our e-commerce and digital capabilities; reimagine our marketing;
deliver positive outcomes for people, our shareholders and the planet; and much more.
These challenges were in addition to the structural issues facing our Company , including: shifting consumer preferences and
behaviors; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce;
continued macroeconomic and political volatility; and an evolving regulatory landscape.
To meet this once in a generation moment and ensure our Company’ s long-term  success, we will continue to focus on becoming
Faster , Stronger , and Better:
•We will become Faster by sustaining or improving growth and market share in our high return foods and snacks
businesses in North America; improving the profitability of our PBNA business and capturing our fair share of category
growth; accelerating our growth and presence in international snacks and food while investing wisely in beverages to
balance between growth and returns; and making the necessary investments in our manufacturing capacity , go-to-market
systems and digital initiatives, such as improving our presence and scale in our e-commerce business.

Table of Contents
•We will become Stronger by renewing our focus on driving holistic cost management throughout our organization to
support our investments in advantaged capabilities, such as a highly agile and flexible end-to-end value chain; more
precision around revenue management; and investing in data analytics that can provide more granularity around consumer
insights. We also plan to continue investing to further expand global business services into new capabilities, which will
enable better insight and support for our businesses at a lower cost. And we will remain focused on diversifying our
workforce and reinforcing The PepsiCo Way, where we emphasize that employees act like owners to get things done
quickly .
•We will become Better by further integr ating purpose into our business strategy and brands by becoming planet positive,
strengthening our roots in our communities, and advancing social justice. This includes supporting practices and
technologies that improve farmer liveli hoods and agricultural resiliency; using precious resources such as water more
efficiently; accelera ting our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout our value chain; driving progress
toward a world where plastics need never become waste; advancing respect for human rights; and investing to promote
shared prosperity in local communities where we live and work.
We believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth.
See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces.
Our Operations
See “Item 1. Busine ss” for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other
supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality , customers, competition and human capital. In addition, see Note 1 to
our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our divisions and geographic areas.
Other Relationships
Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do
not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and
customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In
addition, certain of our employees serve  on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Venture s LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo
and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.
Our Business Risks
COVID-19
Our global operations continue to expo se us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to result in
challenging operatin g environments and has affected almost all of the more than 200 countries  and territories in which our
products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, restrictions on public
gatherings, shelter in place and safer -at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures continue in many of these markets. These
measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our customers (including foodservice customers), consumers, employees,
bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business,
which may result in changes in demand for our products, increases in operat ing costs (whether as a result of changes to our
supply chain or increases in employee costs, including expanded benefits and frontline incentives, costs associated with the
provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, or otherwise), or adverse impacts to our supply chain
through reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, any
30
Table of Contents
of which can impac t our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. In addition, measures that impact our
ability to access our offices (several of which remain closed), plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that
impact the ability of our customers (including our foodservice customers ), consumers, bottlers, contract manufacturers,
distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties to do the same, may continue to impact the availability or
productivity of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely .
Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact demand from consumers,
including due to consumers not leaving their homes or leaving their homes less often than they did prior to the start of the
pandemic or otherwise shopping for and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have
or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result
of measures taken in response to the pandemic. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually , partially ,
or fully reopen in certain of these jurisdictions and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with
the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior , spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. In addition,
as a result  of COVID-19, certain jurisdictions, such as certain states in Mexico,  have enacted or are considering enacting new or
expanded product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of
ingredients or substances contained in such products. Changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase
demand for our products in one quarter , resulting in decreased demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in a lower -
margin sales channel resulting in potent ially reduced profit from sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and
channel preferences as markets move through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times, including changes
in at-home consumption, in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and
foodservice. In addition, we continue to see a rapid increase in demand in the e-commerce and online-to-of fline channels and any
failure to capitalize on this demand could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our
competitive position.
Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued
economic uncertainty , can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which can result in
bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products, reduced or cancel ed orders of our products, continued or additional
closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes, schools or other venues in which our products are sold, or
reduced capacity at any of the foregoing, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary
for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers’ or business partners’
financial condition have also resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional char ges for our inability to recover or
collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or
prepaid expenses. In addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility
in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to
us, or at all.
While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business
continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and
our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous
evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration
and scope of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, global economic conditions
during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in

the future,  in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be
more than just temporary .
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act)
The CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several
significant provision s, such as delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act (TCJ Act) and estimated income tax payments. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our financial results
in 2020, including on our annual estim ated effective tax rate or on our liquid ity. We will continue to monitor and assess the
impact similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial results.
Refer to the COVID-19 discussion above and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Risks Associated with International Operations
We are subject to risks in the normal course of business. During the periods presented in this report, certain jurisdictions in which
our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic,
political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. We
continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to
potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
Imposition of T axes and Regulations on our Products
Certain jurisdictions in which our produ cts are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering
imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging,
ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of
our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our pack aging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope
and form. For exam ple, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric  beverages, while others apply only to beverages
with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g.,
plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling
rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging.
We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countr ies and territories and the profile of the products
we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this,
we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitati ons on our products or their packaging may take,
and therefore cannot predict the impac t of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes,
regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently . We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes
and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we
may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating
alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. The related provisional measurement period
allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. While our accounti ng for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was
deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. For
further information, see “Our Liquidity and
32
Table of Contents
Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
Other T ax Matters
On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF),
effective January 1, 2020. The enactmen t of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During
2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $72 million related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. During 2019,
we recorded net tax expense of $24 million related to the impact of the TRAF . See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5
to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Retail Landscape
Our indus try continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-
commerce websites and mobile comme rce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and
digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discou nters. We have seen and expect to continue to see
a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-of fline, and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-
commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively
through all existing and emer ging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks
and the actions we have taken to address key challenges.
Risk Management Framework
The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks and that those risks may evolve over time. To
identify , assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’ s operations, we leverage
an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following:
•PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’ s integrated risk management framework. One of
the Board’ s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of
the Company’ s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’ s top risks. The Board receives
updates on key risks throughout the year, including risks related to cybersecurity . During 2020, in addition to COVID-19
discussions as part of risk updates to the Board and the relevant Committees, the Board was provided with updates on
COVID-19’ s impac t to our business, financial condition and operations through memos, teleconferences or other
appropriate means of communication. In addition, the Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with
oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters.
◦The Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’ s risk
management and oversight processes, and assists the Board’ s oversight of financial, compliance and employee
safety risks facing PepsiCo;
◦The Comp ensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’ s employee compensation policies and practices to
assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior;
33
Table of Contents
◦The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’ s
governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and
◦The Sustainability , Diversity and Public Policy Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of
PepsiCo’ s policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainability , diversity and inclusion, and public
policy matters.
•The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC), which is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior
management group, including PepsiCo’ s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, meets regularly to identify ,
assess, prioritize and address top strateg ic, financial, operating, compliance, safety , reputational and other risks. The PRC
is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation ef forts to the Board;
•Division and key country risk committe es, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to
identify , assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks;
•PepsiCo’ s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk managem ent process, provides ongoing guidance,
tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses
potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors,
the Audit Committee of the Board and other Committees of the Board;
•PepsiCo’ s Corporate Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic
audit and review procedures; and
•PepsiCo’ s Compliance & Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices.
Market Risks
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal cours e of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of
strategies, including  productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve
the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of
derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See
“Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of our market risks, and see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further
information on our non-cancelable purchasing commitments.
The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market
fluctuations is discussed below . See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and
our hedging policies. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical
plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.
Inflationary , deflatio nary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our
products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.
34
Table of Contents
Commodity Prices
Our comm odity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. At the
end of 2020, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying
commodity price, would have decreased  our net unrealized gains in 2020 by $121 million, which would generally be offset by a
reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.
Foreign Exchange
Our operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our consolida ted net revenue in 2020, with Mexico, Russia,
Canada, the United Kingdom, China and South Africa, collectively , comprising approximately 21% of our consolidated net
revenue in 2020. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are
made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally , we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign
subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During
2020, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2 percentage points, primarily due to declines in the Mexican
peso, Russian ruble and Brazilian real. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our
future financial results.
In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey , and
currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or
increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these internati onal markets may, result in challenging operating
environments. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’ s withdrawal
from the European Union (Brexit), including the effects of the post-Brexit trade deal entered into between the United Kingdom
and the European Union in December 2020, as well as the economic, operat ing and political environment in Russia and the
potential impact for the Europe segment and our other businesses.
Our foreig n currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.9 billion as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. At
the end of 2020, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have increased our net
unrealized losses in 2020 by $175 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the
underlying exposure.
The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020
and $2.5 billion as of December 28, 2019.
Inter est Rates
Our intere st rate derivatives had a total notional value of $3.0 billion as of December 26, 2020 and $5.0 billion as of
December 28, 2019.  Assuming year-end 2020 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest
rates woul d have decreased our net interest expense in 2020 by $80 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-
term investments levels, as compared with our variable rate debt.
OUR FINANCIAL RESUL TS
Results of Operations — Consolidated Review
Volume
Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions,
including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume
provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of
35
Table of Contents
our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our
business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level.
Beverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company-
owned or licensed trademarks and allied brand products and joint venture trademarks sold by company-owned bottling
operations, including by our noncontrolled affiliates. Concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate
shipments and equivalents (CSE), whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (BCS). Both CSE
and BCS convert all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically , CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due
to seasonality , timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net revenue is not
entirely based on BCS volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that BCS is a better measure of the
consumption of our beverage products. PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with
third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton
brand name), and PBNA, either indepen dently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-
drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In addition, APAC licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on
co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with T ingyi.
Food and snack volume includes volume sold by our subsidiaries and noncontrolled affiliates of snack products bearing
company-owned or licensed trademarks. Internationally , we measure food and snack product volume in kilograms, while in
North America we measure food and snack product volume in pounds. FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells Sabra
refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with Strauss Group.
Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit
 2020 2019 Change
Net revenue $ 70,372 $ 67,161 5 %
Operating profit $ 10,080 $ 10,291 (2)%
Operating profit margin 14.3 % 15.3 % (1.0)
See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.
Operating profit decreased 2% and operating profit margin declined 1.0 percentage point. Operating profit performance was
primarily driven by certain operating cost increases, partially of fset by net revenue growth and productivity savings.
The charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacte d operating profit performance by 7 percentage
points. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Additionally , higher inventory fair value
adjustments and merger and integration charges included in “Items Affecting Comparability” and unfavorable foreign exchange
each negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2 percentage points.

(GAAP).
In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below , “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over -year impact of discrete
pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in
different countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over -year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per

FLNA
Net revenue grew 7% and unit volume grew 3%. The net revenue growth was driven by effective net pricing and organic volume
growth.  The unit volume growth primarily reflects double-digit growth in variety packs and dips, and high-single-digit growth in
trademark T ostitos and Ruf fles, partially of fset by a double-digit decline in nuts and seeds.
Operating profit increased 2%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain
operating cost increases. Additionally , the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced operating profit growth
by 4 percentage points.
QFNA
Net revenue and unit volume each increased 10%. The net revenue growth reflects organic volume growth and favorable pricing,
partially offset by unfavorable mix. The unit volume growth was driven by double-digit growth in oatmeal and pancake syrup
and mix and high-single-digit growth in ready-to-eat cereals. The COVID-19 pandemic drove an increase in consumer demand,
which had a positive impact on both net revenue and unit volume growth.
Operating profit grew 23%, reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost
increases. Additionally , the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic  reduced operating profit growth by 3 percentage
points.
PBNA
Net reven ue increas ed 4%, primarily driven by effective net pricing, partiall y offset by a decrease in organic volume. Unit
volume decreased 1%, driven by a 5% decrease in CSD volume, largely offset by a 4% increase in non-carbonated beverage
(NCB) volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected a high-single-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks, a double-
digit incre ase in our energy portfolio, primarily due to acquisitions, and a low-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio,
partially offset by a mid-single-digit decrease in our juice and juice drinks portfolio.  In addition, acquisitions contributed 2
percentage points to net revenue growth.(a)

Operating profit decreased 1 1%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, including incremental information technology costs,  a
14-percentage-point impact of the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the organic volume decrease.  These
impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing, productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses, and a
4-percentage-point impact of lower commodity costs.  Prior -year gains associated with sales of assets negatively impacted
operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. Additionally , impairment charges associated with a coconut water brand
negatively impacted  operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. Acquisitions positively contributed 4 percentage points
to operating profit performance.

AMESA
Net revenu e increased 25%, primarily reflecting a 28-percentage-point impact of the Pioneer Foods acquisition, partially offset
by a 3-per centage-point impact of the prior -year refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in India. Net revenue was
also negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Snacks unit volume grew 199%, primarily reflecting a 195-percentage-point impact of the Pioneer Foods acquisition, double-
digit growth in Pakistan and mid-single -digit growth in the Middle East. Additionally , India and South Africa (excluding our
Pioneer Foods acquisition) each experienced low-single-digit growth.
Beverage unit volume declined 5%, primarily reflecting a double-digit decline in India and a high-single-digit decline in

Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $161 million, primarily reflecting the recognition of fixed income
gains on plan assets, the impact of discr etionary plan contributions and higher prior -year settlement losses, partially offset by the
decrease in discount rates.
Net interes t expense and other increased  $193 million, primarily due to higher average debt balances, lower interest rates on cash,
as well as lower gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation
liability . These impacts were partially of fset by lower interest rates on debt and higher average cash balances.
The reported tax rate decreased 0.1 percentage points, primarily reflecting the net tax benefits related to the TRAF , partially of fset
by an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions.
Non-GAAP Measur es
Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with
U.S. GAAP . We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation
of our annual opera ting plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for
certain employees. We believe presentin g non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to
facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional
transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to
view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.
We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or
that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we
may make  adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring
plans; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical
related items; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law
changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt
redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See
below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form
10-K. 
Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP . In addition, our non-GAAP financial
measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.(a)

Table of Contents
The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-K are discussed below:
Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses , other pension and retiree medical benefits
income/expense, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncon trolling interests and net income attributable to
PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability , operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common
share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability , and the corr esponding constant curr ency gr owth rates
These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do
not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan (2019
Productivity Plan) and our 2014 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan (2014 Producti vity Plan), inventory fair value adjustments and
merger and integration charges associated with our acquisitions, pension-related settlement charges and net tax related to the TCJ
Act (see “Items Affecting Comparabilit y” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on
operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability , and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted,
adjusted for items affecting comparability , each on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming
constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates  in effect for the comparable prior -year period. In
order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appro priate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the
current-year average  foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior -year average
foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because
they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance.
Organic r evenue gr owth
We define organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impa ct of foreign exchange translation, as well as the
impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful
information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing
performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year .
See “Net Revenue and Or ganic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information.
Free cash flow
We define  free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property , plant and
equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational
capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net
capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and
financing activities,  including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash
available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not
deducted from the measure.
See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability
We define ROIC as net income attribut able to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average
debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders’ equity . Although  ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous
methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly , the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the
methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.
We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC,
excluding items affecting comparability , to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because
it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and
reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting
comparability , as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest
income and items affecting comparability . We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting
comparability , provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider
when evaluating our capital allocation ef ficiency .

Mark-to-Market Net Impact
We centrally manage commodity deriv atives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural
products, energy and metals. Commodi ty derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market
each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unalloc ated expenses as either cost of sales or selling,
general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected
in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions
realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in
corporate unallocated expenses.
Restructuring and Impairment Charges
2019 Multi-Y ear Pr oductivity Plan
The 2019 Productiv ity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to
further simplify , harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying
the right automation  for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint.
In connection with this plan, we expec t to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, including cash expenditures of
approximately $1.6 billion. Plan to date through December 26, 2020, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $797 million, including
cash expe nditures of $518 million. In our 2021 financial results, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $500
million, including cash expenditures of approximately $400 million, with the balance to be reflected in our 2022 and 2023
financial results. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the
remaining pre-tax char ges and cash expenditures in our 2021 and 2022 results.
2014 Multi-Y ear Pr oductivity Plan
The 2014 Productivity Plan was completed in 2019. The total plan pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximated the
previously disclosed plan estimates of $1.3 billion and $960 million, respectively .
See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans. We
regularly evaluate productivity initiative s beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our
consolidated financial statements.
Inventory Fair V alue Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges
In 2020, we recorde d inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integra tion charges related to our acquisitions of BFY
Brands, Inc. (BFY Brands), Rockstar , Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery . Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and
integration char ges include fair value adjustments to the acquired(a) (a)

inventory included in the acquisition-da te balance sheets and closing costs, employee-related costs, contract termination costs,
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and other integration costs. Merger and integration charges also include
liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, which are irrevocable conditions of our acquisition of Pioneer
Foods.
In 2019, we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges primarily related to SodaStream’ s
acquired inventory included in acquisition-date balance sheet, as well as merger and integration charges, including employee-
related costs.
See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Pension-Related Settlement Charges
In 2020, we recorded a pension settlement charge related to lump sum distrib utions exceeding the total of annual service and
interest cost.
In 2019, we recorded pension settlement charges related to the purchase of a group annuity contract and one-time lump sum
payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits.
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Net T ax Related to the TCJ Act
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United State s. We recognized net tax benefits in 2019 related
to the TCJ Act.

Our Liquidity and Capital Resour ces
We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working
capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing,
will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, includin g with respect to our net capital spending plans.
Our primary sources of cash available  to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated dividend payments, debt repayments,
payments for acquisitions, including the contingent consideration related to Rockstar , and the transition tax liability under the
TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt and cash and
cash equiv alents. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for
further information.
Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by COVID-19 in 2020 and, to date, we have not identified
any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Base d on the information currently available to us, we
do not expect the impact of COVID-19 to have a material impact on our liquidity . We will continue to monitor and assess the
impact COVID-19 may have on our business and financial results. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further
information. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions, such as delaying certain payroll tax
payments, mandator y transition tax payments under the TCJ Act and estimated income tax payments. The CARES Act did not
have a material impact on our financial  results in 2020, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate or on our liquidity .
We will continue to monitor and assess the impact similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial
results. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for further information related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of December 26, 2020, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency
controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.
The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including $18.9 billion held in
our conso lidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30, 2017. As of December 26, 2020, our mandatory
transition tax liability was $3.2 billion,  which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we currently
expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2021. See “Credit Facilities and Long-T erm Contractual
Commitments.” Any additional guidanc e issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability . See
Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act.
As part of our evolv ing market practices, we work with our suppliers to optim ize our terms and conditions, which include the
extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days,
which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working
with our suppliers to adjust as necessary . We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating
global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts
receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements
is voluntary . Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we
are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’ s
creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which gene rally provides our suppliers with more favorable
terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any
third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to
participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not
impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within
47
Table of Contents
accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We have been informed by the participating
financial institutions that as of Decemb er 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively , of our
accounts payable to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding. These supply chain finance
arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect
such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality . Working capital needs are
impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns and
generally lowest in the first quarter . On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and
enhance our business results, including  acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and
other ef ficiency initiatives and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.
The table below summarizes our cash activity:  
2020 2019
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 10,613  $ 9,649 
Net cash used for investing activities $(11,619) $ (6,437)
Net cash provided by/(used for) financing activities $ 3,819  $ (8,489)
Operating Activities
In 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.6 billion, compared to $9.6 billion in the prior year. The increase in
operating cash flow primarily reflects lower net cash tax payments and lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan
contributions in the current year .
Investing Activities
In 2020, net cash used for investing activities was $11.6 billion, primarily reflecting net cash paid in connection with our
acquisitions of Rockstar of $3.85 billion, Pioneer Foods of $1.2 billion and Be & Cheery of $0.7 billion, net capital spending of
$4.2 billion, as well as purchases of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion.
In 2019, net cash used for investing activities was $6.4 billion, primarily reflecting $4.1 billion of net capital spending, as well as
$1.9 billion of the remaining cash paid in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream.
See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Note 9 to our
consolidated financi al statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities; and see Note 14 to our consolidated
financial statements for further discussion of our acquisitions.
We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and believe that we have suf ficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs.
Financing Activities
In 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting proceeds from issuances of long-term
debt of $13.8 billion, partially offset by the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and
share repurchases of $7.5 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $1.8 billion and debt redemptions of $1.1 billion.

activity . On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0
billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. In addition, on
February 11, 2021, we announced a 5% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.30 per share from $4.09 per share, effective
with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2021. We expect to return a total of approximately $5.9 billion to shareholders in
2021, comprised of dividends of approximately $5.8 billion and share repurchases of approximately $100 million. We have
recently completed our share repurchase activity and do not expect to repurchase any additional shares for the balance of 2021.
Free Cash Flow
The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected in our cash flow statement, to our free cash
flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.”
2020 2019 Change
Net cash provided by operating activities, GAAP measure $ 10,613 $ 9,649 10 %
Capital spending (4,240) (4,232)
Sales of property, plant and equipment 55 170 
Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 6,428 $ 5,587 15 %
We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share
repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while
maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to
global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However , see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for
certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.
Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency , especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or
not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our
ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our
current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we
have experienced historically , and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See
“Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

cans and plastic bottles and closures for us and certain of our independent bottlers. Once we have negotiated the contracts, the
bottlers order and take delivery directly  from the supplier and pay the suppliers  directly . Consequently , transactions between our
independent bottlers and suppliers are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As the contracting party , we could be

OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
An appreciation of our critical accounti ng policies is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require
management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, including those related to the COVID-19
pandemic, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financia l results. The precision of these estimates and the
likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. We applied our
critical accounting policies and estimati on methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have
discussed our critical accounting policies with our Audit Committee.
Our critical accounting policies are:
•revenue recognition;
•goodwill and other intangible assets;
•income tax expense and accruals; and
•pension and retiree medical plans.(a)
(b)
51
Table of Contents
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and
sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers,
which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales
terms that do not allow for a right of return. However , our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and
replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness
they expect. Similarly , our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a
result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date produc ts. We recorded $20 million of
reserves for product  returns in 2020 as a result  of the COVID-19 pandemic . See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements
for further information.
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days
internationally , and may allow discount s for early payment. There were no material changes in credit terms as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility ,
write-of f history , the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the
expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of
creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers (including foodservice and vending
businesses). We recorded an allowance for expected credit losses of $56 million in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Our policy  is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our comm itment to freshness and product dating serves to
regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with
customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks,
we monitor customer inventory levels.
As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to
customers and consumers. Total marke tplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing
activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to
customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new
products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include
support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.
A number  of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on
annual targets, and accruals are establish ed during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur
after year end once reconciled and settle d. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar
programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating custom er and consumer participation and performance
levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in
earnings in the period such differences  are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on
annual tar gets and recognized during the year as incurred.
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies,
including total marketplace spending.

Table of Contents
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were develop ed by us. Brand development costs are expensed
as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions . In a business combination, the consideration is
first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values,
with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires signifi cant estimates and assumptions, including those
related to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on an evaluation of a number of facto rs, such as marketplace participants, product life
cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash
flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the
intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria
are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which gene rally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the
expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market
share, consumer awareness, brand history , future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the
macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.
In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights
to manufacture and/or distribute beverag es for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights,
many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arran gements, the indefinite period expected for these
franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these
franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these
franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the
remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually ,
using either a qualitative or quantitati ve approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter , or more
frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment,
first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include
macroeconomic (including those related  to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry  and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory
environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment
indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, estimated fair value is determined using
discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with
management’ s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetu ity growth assumptions and the selection of
assumptions underly ing a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant
management judgme nt is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including
those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used
in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including
perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are
consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our
results. These
53
Table of Contents
assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks.”
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its
estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
See Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Income T ax Expense and Accruals
Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing
arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our
annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are
fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these
reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax
laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.
An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual
item recognized in our quarterly operat ing results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the
same time as that item. W e consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior -year tax matters to be among such items.
Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial
statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our
tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return,
and some difference s reverse over time,  such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future
years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation
allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax liabilities generally repre sent tax expense recognized in our consolidated
financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax
return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act
imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax
rate from 35% to 21%, ef fective January 1, 2018. We recorded a net tax benefit of $28 million ($0.02 per share) in 2018 related to
the TCJ Act. The related provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. While our
accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted
our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. In 2019, we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $8 million ($0.01 per share)
related to the TCJ Act. See further information in “Items Af fecting Comparability .”
On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain
provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $72 million
related to the adoption of the TRAF in the
54
Table of Contents
Swiss Canton of Bern. During 2019, we recorded net tax expense of $24 million related to the impact of the TRAF .
In 2020, our annual tax rate was 20.9% compared to 21.0% in 2019. See “Other Consolidated Results” for further information.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Pension and Retir ee Medical Plans
Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined
based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also
eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally , our share
of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing
the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.
In 2020, lump sum distributions exceede d the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in
the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) of $205 million ($158 million after -tax or $0.1 1 per share).
In 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants,
effective December 31, 2025. Since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the
effective date, all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of
service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee
contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment, pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected to decrease by
approximately $70 million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.
In 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of
certain participants from Plan A to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I) and to a newly created plan, the PepsiCo
Employees Retirem ent Hourly Plan (Plan H), effective January 1, 2021. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were
unchanged. The reorganization will facilitate a more targeted investment strateg y and provide additional flexibility in evaluating
opportunities to reduce risk and volatility . No material impact to pension benefit pre-tax expense is expected from this
reorganization.
In 2020, we adopted  an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan
H. As a result of this amendment, pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected  to increase approximately $45 million in 2021,
primarily impacting service cost expense.
In 2019, Plan A purchased a group annu ity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and
administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $220
million ($170 million after -tax or $0.12 per share).
Also in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were of fered the option
of receivin g a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’ s pension benefit. This transaction
triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million ($41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). Collectively , the group
annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement
charges in 2019 of $273 million ($21 1 million after -tax or $0.15 per share).
See “Items Af fecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
55
Table of Contents
Our Assumptions
The determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the
amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree
medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working
during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligatio n due to the passage of time (interest cost), and
(3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on
assets for our funded plans.
Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:
•certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover , retirement age and mortality;
•the expected return on assets in our funded plans;
•for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings;
•for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates; and
•for pension and retiree medical expense, the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs
and the present value of liabilities.
Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’ s best judgment regarding future expectations. All
actuarial assumption s are reviewed annually , except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a
curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact
on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.
At each measurement date, the discount  rates are based on interest rates for high-quality , long-term corporate debt securities with
maturities comparab le to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the
discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and
amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial  statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’
investment strategy . Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given
year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.
The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans’ obligation and expense is reviewed annually . Our review is
based on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care
industry . Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and
changes in medical carriers.
56
Table of Contents
Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows:  
2021 2020 2019
Pension
Service cost discount rate 2.6 % 3.4 % 4.4 %
Interest cost discount rate 1.9 % 2.8 % 3.9 %
Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.2 % 6.6 % 6.8 %
Expected rate of salary increases 3.1 % 3.2 % 3.2 %

Expected rate of return on plan assets 5.4 % 5.8 % 6.6 %
Current health care cost trend rate 5.5 % 5.6 % 5.7 %
In 2020, lump sum distributions exceede d the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in
Plan A. In addition , based on our assumptions, we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to decrease in 2021
primarily reflecting the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets, the impact of discretionary plan contributions and plan
changes, partially of fset by lower discount rates and lower rate of expected returns on U.S. plan assets.
Sensitivity of Assumptions
A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our
benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would
individually increase 2021 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:
Assumption Amount
Discount rates used in the calculation of expense $ 55 
Expected rate of return $ 50 
Funding
We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain  pension plans. These contributions are made in
accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the
employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally , we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be
currently tax deduct ible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulato ry funding requirements, we generally fund these
plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these
benefits.
In Novem ber 2020, we received approva l from our Board of Directors to make discretionary contributions of $500 million to our
U.S. quali fied defin ed benefit plans. We contributed $300 million of the approved amount in January 2021; we expect to
contribute the remaining $200 million in the third quarter of 2021. We made discretionary contributions to our U.S. qualified
defined benefit plans of $325 million in 2020 and $400 million in 2019.
Our pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates,
deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We continue to monitor the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic and related  global economic conditions and uncertainty on the net unfunded status of our pension
and retiree medical plans. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension
and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and
estimated future benefit payments.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 — Basis of Pr esentation and Our Divisions
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the
consolidated accoun ts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain
other affiliates using the equity method  based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence
over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control
these other affiliates , as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions
are elimin ated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan
subsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period
presented.
Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production
planning, inspection  costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and
delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in
determining, among  other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical
accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-
lived brands, goodwill and other long-liv ed assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience,
as well as other facto rs we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise
our estimates as circumstances change. The business and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has made
such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision,
actual results could dif fer significantly from those estimates.
Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturda y of each December , resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years.
While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, substantially all of our international operations report
on a monthly calend ar basis. Certain operations in our Europe segment report on a weekly calendar basis. The following chart
details our quarterly reporting schedule for the three years presented:
Quarter United States and Canada International
First Quarter 12 weeks January , February
Second Quarter 12 weeks March, April and May
Third Quarter 12 weeks June, July and August
Fourth Quarter 16 weeks September , October , November and December
Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share
amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to
the prior year ’s consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.

Our Divisions
We are or ganized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows:
1)FLNA, which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada;
2)QFNA, which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada;
3)PBNA, which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada;
4)LatAm, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America;
5)Europe, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe;
6)AMESA, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and
7)APAC, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and
China region.
Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a
wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and
territories with our largest operations in the United States, Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and South
Africa.
The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation
methodologies:
•share-based compensation expense;
•pension and retiree medical expense; and
•derivatives.
Share-Based Compensation Expense
Our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our
divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost.
The allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows:
2020 2019 2018
FLNA 13 % 13 % 13 %
QFNA 1 % 1 % 1 %
PBNA 18 % 17 % 18 %
LatAm 6 % 7 % 8 %
Europe 16 % 17 % 9 %
AMESA 6 % 3 % 4 %
APAC 2 % 5 % 4 %
Corporate unallocated expenses 38 % 37 % 43 %
The expen se allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market
conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual
expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.
Pension and Retir ee Medical Expense
Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between
the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7
is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.
65
Table of Contents
Derivatives
We centra lly manag e commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural
products, energy and metals. Commodi ty derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market
each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unalloc ated expenses as either cost of sales or selling,
general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected
in division  results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions
realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in
corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading
or speculative purposes.
Net Revenue and Operating Profit
Net revenue and operating profit of each division are as follows:

(a) In 2020, the increase in net revenue primarily reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 14 for further information.
(b) In 2020, the increase in net revenue primarily reflects our acquisition of Be & Cheery . See Note 14 for further information.
Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and food and snack products to our customers. The
following tables reflect the approximate  percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our food and
snack business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue:
2020 2019 2018
Beverage Food/Snack Beverage Food/Snack Beverage Food/Snack
LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 %
Europe 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 % 50 % 50 %

APAC 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 %
PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 %
(a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe segments, is approximately
40% of our consolidated net revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Generally , our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating
margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages.

Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and
sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers,
which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performe d after a customer obtains control of the product,
are accoun ted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliv er product to our customers and are recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. In addition,
we exclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue
producing transactions.
The transf er of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of
return. However , our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove(a)
 (b)

and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and
freshness they expect. Similarly , our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date
products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date produc ts. We recorded
$20 million of reserves for product returns in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic . See Note 1 for further information.
As a resul t of the implementation of the revenue recognition guidance adopted in the first quarter of 2018, which did not have a
material impact on our accounting policies, we recorded an adjustment in the first quarter of 2018 of $137 million to beginning
retained earnings to reflect marketplace spending that our customers and independent bottlers expected to be entitled to in line
with revenue recognition.
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days
internationally , and may allow discount s for early payment. There were no material changes in credit terms as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility ,
write-of f history , the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the
expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of
creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers (including foodservice and vending
businesses). We recorded an allowance for expected credit losses of $56 million in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
See Note 1 for further information. Expected credit loss expense is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses
on our income statement.
We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, inclu ding Walmart. In 2020, sales to Walmart and its
affiliates (including Sam’ s) represented approximately 14% of our consolidate d net revenue, including concentrate sales to our
independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with
these customers.
Total Marketplace Spending
We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending
includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily
accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as
payments for in-store displays, payment s to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote
lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of
advertising and other marketing activities.
A number  of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on
annual targets, and accruals are establish ed during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur
after year end once reconciled and settle d. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar
programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating custom er and consumer participation and performance
levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in
earnings in the period such differences  are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on
annual tar gets and recognized during the year as incurred.
The terms  of most of our incentive arran gements do not exceed a year, and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term
estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers
under these arrangements are recognized over the
69
Table of Contents
shorter of the econo mic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $299 million as of
December 26, 2020 and $272 million as of December 28, 2019 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and
other assets on our balance sheet. We recorded reserves of $59 million for upfront payments to customers in 2020 as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic . See Note 1 for further information.
For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our
interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our
forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’ s actual gross revenue or volume, as
applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim
period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that
they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising
and other marketing activities. Our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation
methodology .
Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $4.6 billion in 2020,
$4.7 billion in 2019  and $4.2 billion in 2018, including advertising expenses of $3.0 billion in both 2020 and 2019, and $2.6
billion in 2018. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:
•media and personal service prepayments;
•promotional materials in inventory; and
•production costs of future media advertising.
Deferred advertising costs of $48 million and $55 million as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively , are
classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.
Distribution Costs
Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are
reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $11.9 billion in 2020, $10.9
billion in 2019 and $10.5 billion in 2018.
Software Costs
We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining
computer software for internal use when  both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will
be used as intended.  Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or
obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software
projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included
in property , plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the
estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $152 million in 2020,
$166 milli on in 2019 and $204 million  in 2018. Net capitalized software and development costs were $664 million and $572
million as of December 26, 2020  and December 28, 2019, respectively .
Commitments and Contingencies
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certa in taxes and environmental matters, as well as
commitments under  contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments
when a loss is probable and estimable.
70
Table of Contents
Research and Development
We engage  in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation
globally . Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research
and development costs were $719 million, $711 million and $680 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively , and are reported
within selling, general and administrative expenses.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually ,
using either a qualitative or quantitati ve approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter , or more
frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment,
first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include
macroeconomic (including those related  to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry  and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory
environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment
indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair
value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively . Estimated fair value is determined using
discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with
management’ s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetu ity growth assumptions and the selection of
assumptions underly ing a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant
management judgme nt is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including
those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used
in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including
perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are
consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our
results.
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its
estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
See Note 4 for further information.
Other Significant Accounting Policies
Our other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows:
•Basis of Presentation  – Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis  of presentation and
consolidation.
•Income T axes – Note 5.
•Share-Based Compensation –  Note 6.
•Pension, Retir ee Medical and Savings Plans  – Note 7.
•Financial Instruments  – Note 9.
•Cash Equivalents  – Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
71
Table of Contents
•Inventories – Note 15. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the
average; first-in, first-out (FIFO); or , in limited instances, last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods.
•Property , Plant and Equipment  – Note 15. Propert y, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is
recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset’ s estimated useful life. Land is not depreciated and construction in
progress is not depreciated until ready for service.
•Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries  – Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated
into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for
revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity as currency translation adjustment.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted
In 2016, the Financi al Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure
credit losses for most financial assets. Under the new model we are required to estimate expected credit losses over the life of our
trade receivables, certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments. The new model replaced the existing incurred
credit loss model and generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We adopted this guidance in the first
quarter of 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolida ted financial statements or disclosures. On initial
recognition, we recorded an after-tax cumulative effect decrease to retained earnings of $34 million ($44 million pre-tax) as of
the beginning of 2020.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Y et Adopted
In 2019, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1)
recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax
basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction, (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in
tax law in the period  of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on
income in the incom e tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. The
guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2021 with early adoption permitte d. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes
effective in the first quarter of 2021. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements or related disclosures.

2019 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan
The 2019 Productiv ity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to
further simplify , harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying
the right automation  for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint.
In connection with this plan, we expec t to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, including cash expenditures of
approximately $1.6 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 65% of severance and other
employee-related costs, 15% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 20% for
other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. W e expect to complete this plan by 2023.

2014 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan
The 2014 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 13, 2014, included the next generation of productivity initiatives
that we believed would strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing
automation; further  optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, includin g closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-
engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified
organization structures to drive ef ficiency . To build on the 2014 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded and
extended the plan through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above that
further strengthened our beverage, food and snack businesses.
The 2014 Productivity Plan was comple ted in 2019. In 2019, there were no material pre-tax charges related to this plan and all
cash paym ents were paid at year end. The total plan pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximated the previously disclosed
plan estimates of $1.3 billion and $960 million, respectively . These total plan pre-tax charges consisted of 59% of severance and
other employee costs, 15% of asset impairments and 26% of other costs, including costs associated with the implementation of
our initiatives, including certain consulting and other contract termination costs. These total plan pre-tax charges were incurred

(a) The change in 2020 primarily reflects our distribution agreement with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with an expected residual value higher than our carrying value. The
distribution agreement’ s useful life is three  years, in accordance with the three-year termination notice issued, and is not reflected in the average useful life above.
(b) The change in 2020 primarily reflects our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery . See Note 14 for further information.
Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over an intangible asset’ s estimated useful life. Amortization of intangible
assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 26, 2020 and using average 2020 foreign
exchange rates, is expected to be as follows:
2021 2022 2023 2024 2025
Five-year projected amortization $ 92 $ 89 $ 87 $ 87 $ 84 
Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written
down to its estimat ed fair value, whic h is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to
determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019
and December 29, 2018. In 2020, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $41 million related to a coconut water brand in
PBNA. We did not recognize any material impairment charges for indefinite-l ived intangible assets in each of the years ended
December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018. As of December 26, 2020, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived
reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However , there could be an
impairment of the carrying value of PBNA ’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to
the operating results of PBNA ’s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions
result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimat e fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of
the macroeconomic conditions in Russia on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia and have
concluded that there are no impairment s for the year ended December 26, 2020. However , there could be an impairment of the
carrying value of certain brands in Russia, including juice and dairy brands, if there is a deterioration in these conditions, if future
revenues and their contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash flows (including perpetuity
growth assumptions), if there are significant changes in the decisions regarding assets that do not perform consistent with our
expectations, or if macroeconomic cond itions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate
fair value. For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2.(a)

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act
imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax
rate from 35% to 21%, ef fective January 1, 2018. 
In 2017, the SEC issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allowed recording of provisional tax expense using a
measurement period , not to exceed one year, when information necessary to complete the accounting for the effects of the TCJ
Act is not available. We elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the
TCJ Act when it became ef fective in the fourth quarter of 2017.
As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion ($1.70 per share) in the
fourth quarter of 2017.

Table of Contents
The provis ional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result, in 2018, we recognized
a net tax benefit of $28 million ($0.02 per share) related to the TCJ Act. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ
Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted  our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018.
In 2019, we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $8 million ($0.01 per share) related to the TCJ Act. There were no tax amounts
recognized in 2020 related to the TCJ Act.
As of December 26, 2020, our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.2 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the
provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $78 million in
2020, $663 million in 2019 and $150 million in 2018. We currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in
2021.
The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax
income (GIL TI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder . The FASB allows an accounting policy election
of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such
taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. During the first quarter of 2018, we elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a
current-period expense when incurred.
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act
The CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several
significant provisions, such as delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandator y transition tax payments under the TCJ Act and
estimated income tax payments. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our financial results in 2020, including on
our annual estimated effective tax rate or on our liquidity . We will continue to monitor and assess the impact similar legislation in
other countries may have on our business and financial results.
Other T ax Matters
On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain
provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $72 million
related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. During 2019, we recorded net tax expense of $24 million
related to the impac t of the TRAF . While the accounting for the impacts of the TRAF are deemed to be complete, further
adjustments to our financial statements  and related disclosures could be made in future quarters, including in connection with
final tax return filings.
In 2018, we reorganized certain of our international operations, including the intercompany transfer of certain intangible assets.
As a result, we recognized other net tax benefits of $4.3 billion ($3.05 per share) in 2018. The related deferred tax asset of $4.4
billion is being amortized over a period of 15 years beginning in 2019. Additio nally , the reorganization generated significant net
operating loss carryforwards and related deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized, resulting in the recording of a full
valuation allowance.

In 2018, we recogn ized a non-cash tax benefit of $364 million ($0.26 per share) resulting from the conclusion of certain
international tax audits. Additionally , in 2018, we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $353 million ($0.24 per share) as a result
of our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, including the
associated state impact. The conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS, collectively , resulted in
non-cash tax benefits totaling $717 million ($0.50 per share) in 2018.
Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer
pricing arrangemen ts, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in
determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establi sh reserves when, despite our belief that our tax
return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not
succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the
progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would
usually require the use of cash. Favora ble resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of
resolution.
As of December 26, 2020, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes,  reported in other liabilities, was $1.6 billion. We
accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in
selling, general and administrative expe nses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $338 million
as of Dece mber 26, 2020, of which $93 million of tax expense was recognized in 2020. The gross amount of interest accrued,
reported in other liabilities, was $250 million as of December 28, 2019, of which $84 million of tax expense was recognized in
2019.

Carryforwards and Allowances
Operating loss carryforwards totaling $28.3 billion as of December 26, 2020 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and
state jurisd ictions where we are permitt ed to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These
operating losses will expire as follows: $0.2 billion in 2021, $25.2 billion between 2022 and 2040 and $2.9 billion may be carried
forward indefinitely . We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Undistributed International Earnings
In 2018, we repatriated $20.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held in our foreign subsidiaries without
such funds being subject to further U.S. federal income tax liability , related to the TCJ Act. As of December 26, 2020, we had
approximately $6 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $6 billion of earnings outside
the United States for the
81
Table of Contents
foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense, no deferred
tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have
been recognized. It is not practicable  for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested
international earnings.
Note 6 — Shar e-Based Compensation
Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with
the interests of our shareholders. Peps iCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, PEPunits and long-term cash awards to
employees under the shareholder -approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-T erm Incentive  Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-
term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a
combination thereof . Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise
been grant ed. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34%
long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance tar gets.
The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirem ents resulting from the exercise of stock options
and the vesting of RSUs, PSUs and PEPunits.
As of December 26, 2020, 52 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the L TIP.
The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and
administrative expenses, and excess tax benefits recognized:
2020 2019 2018
Share-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 264 $ 237 $ 256

Income tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation $ 48 $ 39 $ 45 
Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation $ 35 $ 50 $ 48 
As of December 26, 2020, there was $300 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two
years.
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions
The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years. Awards to
employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the
date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition,
we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are
expected to vest.
We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively . Repricing of awards would require
shareholder approval under the L TIP.

Table of Contents
Stock Options
A stock option perm its the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee
stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense
at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date
of grant and generally have a 10-year term.
Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:
2020 2019 2018
Expected life 6 years 5 years 5 years
Risk-free interest rate 0.9 % 2.4 % 2.6 %
Expected volatility 14 % 14 % 12 %
Expected dividend yield 3.4 % 3.1 % 2.7 %
The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical
experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life.
Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical  period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend
yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and
stock price.

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units
Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end
of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end
of the service period based on PepsiCo’ s performance against specified financial performance metrics. The number of shares may
be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in
accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend
equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable.
The fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Company’ s stock on the date of grant.(a) (a)

Note 7 — Pension, Retir ee Medical and Savings Plans
In 2020, lump sum distributions exceede d the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in
Plan A of $205 million ($158 million after -tax or $0.1 1 per share).
In 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants,
effective December 31, 2025. Since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the
effective date, all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of
service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee
contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment, pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected to decrease by
approximately $70 million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.
In 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of
certain participants from Plan A to Plan I and to a newly created plan, Plan H, effective January 1, 2021. The benefits offered to
the plans’ participants were unchanged . The reorganization will facilitate a more targeted investment strategy and provide
additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility . No material impact to pension benefit pre-tax
expense is expected from this reor ganization.
In 2020, we adopted  an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan
H. As a result of this amendment, pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected  to increase approximately $45 million in 2021,
primarily impacting service cost expense.
In 2019, Plan A purchased a group annu ity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and
administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $220
million ($170 million after -tax or $0.12 per share).
Also in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were of fered the option
of receivin g a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’ s pension benefit. This transaction
triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million ($41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). Collectively , the group
annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement
charges in 2019 of $273 million ($21 1 million after -tax or $0.15 per share).
Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual
return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets, as well as chan ges in our assumptions, are determined at each
measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
If this net accumula ted gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a
portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year
based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 10 years) and retiree medical
(approximately 8 years), or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 23 years). In 2021, we expect
the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A to be approximately 9 years, the remaining life expectancy for
participants in Plan I to be approxima tely 27 years and the average remaining service life for participants in Plan H to be
approximately 1 1 years.
The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior  employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is
included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining
service life for participants in both Plan A and Plan H, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the
freeze will be amortized on a

Table of Contents
The amount we report in operating profi t as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the value of benefits earned
by employees for working during the year .
The amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:
•Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.
•Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will
be used to settle future benefit obligations.
•Amortization of prior service cost/(cred it) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting
from plan amendments.
•Amortization of net loss/(gain) represen ts the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets
and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.
•Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related
projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan
due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are
irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Lump sum payouts
are generally higher when interest rates  are lower . Curtailments are due to events such as plant closures or the sale of a
business resulting in a reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses  are recognized when an event is probable
and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate
or an amendment is adopted).
•Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as
restructuring.
The components of total pension and retiree medical benefit costs are as follows:

(a) The decrease in U.S. pension plans in 2020 primarily reflects the approved reorganization of the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans, resulting in the transfer of
obligations and plan assets relating to certain participants from Plan A to Plan I and Plan H.
Of the total projecte d pension benefit obligation as of December 26, 2020, appro ximately $854 million relates to plans that we do
not fund because the funding of such plans does not receive favorable tax treatment.
Future Benefit Payments    
Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 - 2030
Pension $ 925 $ 1,080 $ 915 $ 960 $ 990 $ 5,270 
Retiree medical $ 95 $ 95 $ 90 $ 85 $ 80 $ 370 
(a) Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies
are expected to be approximately $1 million for each of the years from 2021 through 2025 and approximately $4 million in total for 2026 through 2030.
These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans.(a)

(a) Includes $325 million contribution in 2020, $400 million contribution in 2019 and $1.4 billion contribution in 2018 to fund Plan A in the United States.
In Novem ber 2020, we received approva l from our Board of Directors to make discretionary contributions of $500 million to our
U.S. quali fied defin ed benefit plans. We contributed $300 million of the approved amount in January 2021; we expect to
contribute the remaining $200 million in the third quarter of 2021. In addition , in 2021, we expect to make non-discretionary
contributions of approximately $160 million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans and approximately $50 million
for retiree medical benefits.
We contin ue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions and uncertainty on the net
unfunded status of our pension and retiree medical plans. We regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility
associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.
Plan Assets
Our pensio n plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction
with plan obligation s, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This
strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are
available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Asset s contributed to our pension plans are no longer
controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However , we are indirectly impacted by changes in
these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan
assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return
expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to
reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future
date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards.
For 2021 and 2020 , our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 6.4% and 6.8%, respectively . Our target
investment allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows:
2021 2020
Fixed income 51 % 50 %
U.S. equity 24 % 25 %
International equity 21 % 21 %
Real estate 4 % 4 %
Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly
review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.
The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset
class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current
levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the(a)
90
Table of Contents
reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable.
To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all
other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference
between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the effect of
reducing year -to-year volatility .
Plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2020 and 2019 are categorized  consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both
years and are as follows:

(b)Invested in U.S. and international common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock
investments. The common stock is based on quoted prices in active markets. The commingled funds are based on the published price of the fund and include one large-cap fund
that represents 13% and 16% of total U.S. plan assets for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The preferred stock investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities
in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. The international portfolio includes Level 1 assets of $2,119 million and $1,941 million for 2020 and 2019,
respectively, and Level 2 assets of $32 million for 2019.
(c)These investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. Corporate bonds of U.S.-based

Savings Plan
Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. The
plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement and we make Company matching contributions for certain
employees on a portion of employee contributions based on years of service.
Certain U.S. salaried employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined  benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive
an employer contribution based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.
In 2020, 2019 and 2018, our total Company contributions were $225 million, $197 million and $180 million, respectively .

In 2020, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreemen t (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on
May 31, 2021. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion in U.S.
dollars and/or euros, subject to custom ary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be
increased up to $4.5 billion in U.S dollars and/or euros. We may request renewa l of this facility for an additional 364-day period
or convert any amou nts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than
the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $3.75 billion 364-day credit
agreement, dated as of June 3, 2019. The 364-Day Credit Agreement is in addition to the five-year unsecured revolving credit
agreement (Five-Y ear Credit Agreement) we entered into in 2019, and which  expires on June 3, 2024. The Five-Y ear Credit
Agreement enables us and our borrowi ng subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a
$0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted  to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to
customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion in U.S.
dollars and/or euros. Additionally , we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period.
Funds borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement and Five-Y ear Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate
purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow , prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of
December 26, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Agreement or the Five-Y ear Credit
Agreement.
In 2020, one of our international consolidated subsidiaries borrowed 21.7 billion South African rand, or approximately
$1.3 billion, from our two unsecured bridge loan facilities (Bridge Loan Facilities) to fund(a)
93
Table of Contents
our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. These borrowings were fully repaid in April 2020 and no further borrowings under these Bridge
Loan Facilities are permitted.
In 2020, we paid $1.1 billion to redeem  all $1.1 billion outstanding principal amount of our 2.15% senior notes due 2020 and
terminated associated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $0.8 billion.
In 2019, we paid $1.0 billion to redeem all $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of our 4.50% senior notes due 2020.
In 2018, we comple ted a cash tender offer to redeem $1.3 billion of certain notes issued by PepsiCo and predecessors to a
PepsiCo subsidiary for $1.6 billion in cash. Also in 2018, we completed an exchange offer for certain notes issued by
predecessors to a PepsiCo subsidiary for newly issued PepsiCo notes. These notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount
of $732 million, equal to the exchanged notes. As a result of the above transactions, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $253 million
($191 million after-tax or $0.13 per share) to interest expense in 2018, primarily representing the tender price paid over the
carrying value of the tendered notes.
Note 9 — Financial Instruments
Derivatives and Hedging
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal cours e of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of
strategies, including  productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve
the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of
derivatives. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our global purchasing programs include
fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.
Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain
derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not
qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging
instrument’ s fair value to offset corresp onding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item
impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable
that the hedged transaction will not occur , we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains
or losses reclassified during the year ended December 26, 2020 were not material.
Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating
activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with
the underlying hedged item.
Credit Risk
We perform assessments of our counterp arty credit risk regularly , including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of
credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty . Based on our most recent assessment of
our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to
94
Table of Contents
be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financia l institutions that we believe are creditworthy in
order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.
Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full colla teral on derivative instruments in a net liability
position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’ s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on
credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments
with credi t-risk-related contingent featu res that were in a net liability position as of December 26, 2020 was $283 million. We
have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contin gent features were triggered as of December 26,
2020.
Commodity Prices
We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increase d costs through higher pricing may be limited in
the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed throu gh the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase
orders, pricing agreements and derivativ e instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply
of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms
of no more than three years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for
agricultural products, energy and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated
expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These
gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the division s recognize the cost of the underlying commodity
in operating profit.
Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019.
Foreign Exchange
We are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed
or sold. Additionally , we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency
purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through
sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currenci es with foreign suppliers and through the use of
derivatives, primarily forward contracts  with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign
currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. We also use net
investment hedges to partially of fset the ef fects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.9 billion as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. The
total notional amount of our debt instrum ents designated as net investment hedg es was $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020 and
$2.5 billio n as of December 28, 2019. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains
and losses were of fset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings.
Inter est Rates
We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and
overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps,
cross-currency interest rate swaps, T reasury locks and
95
Table of Contents
swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest
rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. The
notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the
principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our cross-cur rency interest rate swaps have terms of no more
than twelv e years. Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating
to forecasted debt transactions.
Our intere st rate derivatives had a total notional value of $3.0 billion as of December 26, 2020 and $5.0 billion as of
December 28, 2019.
As of December 26, 2020, approximately 3% of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was
subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 9% as of December 28, 2019.
Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities
Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity .
Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. Our held-to-
maturity debt securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper . As of December 26, 2020, we had $2.1 billion
of investments in U.S. Treasury securities with $2.0 billion recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $0.1 billion in short-term
investments. We had no investments in U.S. Treasury securities as of December 28, 2019. As of December 26, 2020, we had
$260 million of investments in commercial paper with $75 million recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $185 million in
short-term investme nts. As of December  28, 2019, we had $130 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and
cash equivalents. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized
gains or losses are reported in earnings. Our investments mature in less than one year. As of December 26, 2020 and December
28, 2019, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material.

(a) Fair value hierarchy levels  are defined in Note 7. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current
assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities.
(b) Based on the price of index  funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred
compensation liability .
(c) Based primarily on the price of our common stock.
(d) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections.
(e) In connection  with our acquisition of Rockstar , we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years, with an option to accelerate
all remaining payments, with estimated maximum payments of approximately $1.1 billion, using curren t tax rates. The fair value of the liability is estimated using
probability-weighted, discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used to estimate the fair value include the
expected future tax benefits associated with the acquisition, the probability that the option to accelerate all remaining payments will be exercised and discount rates.
The expected annual future  tax benefits range from approximately $40 million to $110 million, with an average of $70 million. The probability , in any given year, that
the option to accelerate will be exercised ranges from  3 to 25 percent, with a weighted-average payment period of approximately 4 years. The discount rates range from
less than 1 percent to 5 percent, with a weighted average of 3 percent. The contingent consideration measured at fair value using unobservable inputs as of December
26, 2020 is $861 million, comprised of an $882 million liability recognized at the acquisition date of Rockstar and a fair value decrease of $21 million in the year ended
December 26, 2020, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.
(f) Based on London Interbank Offered Rate forward rates. As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was
$0.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively , and classified on our balance sheet within short-term and long-term debt obligations. As of December 26, 2020 and
December 28, 2019, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was a $2 million gain and $5 million loss, respectively . As of
December 26, 2020, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $19 million loss, which is being amortized over the
remaining life of the related debt obligations.(a) (a) (a) (a) (a)

Note 13 — Leases
Lessee
We determine whether an arrangement  is a lease at inception. We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution
centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally
have rema ining lease terms of up to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years, and
some of which inclu de options to terminate the lease within one year. We consider these options in determining the lease term
used to establish our right-of-use assets  and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value
guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available
at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
We have lease agreements that contai n both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease
components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
PepsiCo, Inc.:
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of
December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash
Flows, and Equity for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2020 and the related notes
(collectively , the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Or ganizations of the T readway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the financial position
of the Com pany as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2020, in confo rmity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Or ganizations of the T readway Commission.
As permit ted by SEC guidance, the scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting as of December 26, 2020 excluded Pioneer Food Group Ltd. and its subsidiaries (Pioneer Foods) and Hangzhou
Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries (Be & Cheery), both of which the Company acquired in 2020. Pioneer Foods’ total
assets and net revenue represented approximately 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively , of the consolidated total assets and net revenue of
the Comp any as of and for the year ended December 26, 2020. Be & Cheery’ s total assets and net revenue represented
approximately 1.1% and 0.4%, respectively , of the consolidated total assets and net revenue of the Company as of and for the
year ended December 26, 2020. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation
of the internal control over financial reporting of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery .
Basis for Opinions
The Company’ s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financi al Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’ s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’ s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCA OB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Thos e standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedu res to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
107
Table of Contents
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. W e believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting  principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provid e reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding preventi on or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s
assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below , providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Sales incentive accruals
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through
various programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the
need to accrue for the expected liability . These incentives are accrued for in the “Accounts payable and other current
liabilities” line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding
customer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends.
We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’ s sales incentive accrua ls as a critical audit matter . Subjective and
complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference
between when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer
and consumer participation
108
Table of Contents
and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical experience and trends.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critica l audit matter . We evaluated the design and
tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter . This included controls
related to the Company’ s sales incentive process, including (1) the accrual meth odology , (2) assumptions around forecasted
customer and consumer participation, (3) performance levels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred
compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical periods. T o evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued
sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales
incentives that may require additional testing, (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis, based on
volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Company’ s ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive
accrual by comparing previously establi shed accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims
that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual.
Carrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain juice and dairy brands
As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing of its
indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and
changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. The carrying value
of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 26, 2020 was $36.4 billion  which represents 39% of total assets, and
includes PepsiCo Beverages North Ame rica’s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value
of $8.6 billion as of December 26, 2020.
We identi fied the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA ’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain of
Europe’ s juice and dairy brands in Russ ia as a critical audit matter . Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the
impact of competitiv e operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The
impairment analysis  of these indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the
Company’ s forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of
the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critica l audit matter . We evaluated the design and
tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter . This included controls
related to the Comp any’s indefinite-live d assets impairment process to develop  the forecasted revenue, profitability levels,
and expected long-term growth rates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. We also
evaluated the sensitivity of the Company’ s conclusion to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in
assumptions from prior periods. To assess the Company’ s ability to accurately forecast, we compared the Company’ s
historical forecasted  results to actual results. We compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with
available external industry data and other internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills
and knowledge who assisted in evaluatin g (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against
economic data and information specific  to the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic
Product growth in the respective local countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them
against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly availabl e market data, including that of comparable
companies.

Unrecognized tax benefits
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’ s global operating model gives rise to income
tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which  it operates. As of December 26, 2020, the
Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.6 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes
that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though
the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well
as the related intere st, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court
rulings or tax authority settlements.
We identified the evaluation of the Company’ s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of
tax law and interpretation of a tax authority’ s settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment. Such
judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring
liabilities for positions taken in prior years’ tax returns in light of new information.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critica l audit matter . We evaluated the design and
tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter . This included controls
related to the Company’ s unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax
positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority’ s settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and
(3) monito r for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of
a tax exam ination, new tax law or tax authority settlements. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized
skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Company’ s tax structure
and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Company’ s interpretation of existing tax law
as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated extern al counsel opinions, information from tax
examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements.

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON ST OCK
The following description of our common stock is based upon our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation,
effective as of May 1, 2019 (“Articles of Incorporation”), our By-Laws, as amended and restated, effective as of April 15, 2020
(“By-Laws”) and applicable provisions of law. We have summarized certain portions of the Articles of Incorporation and By-
Laws below. The summary is not complete. The Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws are incorporated by reference as exhibits
to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this exhibit is a part. Y ou should read the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws for
the provisions that are important to you.
General
Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 3,600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value one and two-thirds
cents (1-2/ 3 cents) per share. As of February 4, 2021, there were 1,379,608,641 shares of common stock outstanding which were
held of record by 105,807 shareholders.
Voting Rights.  Each holder of a share of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held of record on the
applicable record date on each matter submitted to a vote of
    
shareholders. Action on a matter generally requires that the votes cast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast in opposition. A
plurality vote is required in an election of the Board of Directors where the number of director nominees exceeds the number of
directors to be elected.
Dividend Rights.  Hold ers of our common stock are entitl ed to receive dividends as may be declared from time to time by
PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor .
Rights Upon Liquidation.  Holders of our common stock are entitled to share pro rata, upon any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of Pepsi Co, in all remaining assets available for distribution to share holders after payment or providing for PepsiCo’ s
liabilities.
Preemptive Rights.  Holders of our common stock do not have the right to subscribe for, purchase or receive new or
additional common stock or other securities.
Transfer Agent and Registrar
Computershare T rust Company , N.A. is the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock.
Stock Exchange Listing
The Nasdaq Global Select Market is the principal market for our common stock, where it is listed under the symbol
“PEP ,” and our common stock is also listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange.
Certain Pr ovisions of PepsiCo’ s Articles of Incorporation and By -Laws; Dir ector Indemnification Agr eements
Advance Notice of Proposals and Nom inations.  Our By-Laws provide that shareholders must provide timely written
notice to bring busin ess before an annual meeting of shareholders or to nominat e candidates for election as directors at an annual
meeting of shareholders. Notice for an annual meeting is generally timely if it is received at our principal office not less than
90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. However , if the date of the
annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed more than 60 days from this anniversary date, or if no annual
meeting was held in the preceding year, such notice by the shareholder must be delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to
the annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth
day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting was first made. Shareholders utilizing
“proxy access” must meet separate deadlines. The By-Laws also specify the form and content of a shareholder ’s notice. These
2
provisions may prevent shareholders from bringing matters before an annua l meeting of shareholders or from nominating
candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of shareholders.
Proxy Access.  Our By-Laws conta in “proxy access” provisions which give an eligible shareho lder (or a group of up to 20
shareholders aggreg ating their shares) that has owned 3% or more of the outstanding common stock continuously for at least
three years the right to nominate the greater of two nominees and 20% of the number of directors to be elected at the applicable
annual general meeting, and to have those nominees included in our proxy materials, subject to the other terms and conditions of
our By-Laws.
Special Meetings.  A special meeting of the shareholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board, by resolution of the
Board or by our corporate secretary upon written request of one or more share holders holding shares of record representing at
least 20% in the aggregate of our outsta nding common stock entitled to vote at such meeting. Any such special meeting called at
the reques t of our shareholders will be held at such date, time and place (if any) as may be fixed by our Board, provided that the
date of such special meeting may not be more than 90 days from the receipt of such request by the corporate secretary . The By-
Laws specify the form and content of a shareholder ’s request for a special meeting.
Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees.  Our By-L aws provi de that unless the Board determines otherwise,
we shall indemnify , to the full extent permitted by law, any person who was or is, or who is threatened to be made, a party to an
action, suit or proceeding (including appeals), whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or arbitrative, by reason of the
fact that such person, such person’ s testator or intestate, is or was one of our directors, officers or employees, or is or was serving
at our request as a director , officer or employee of another enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding. Pursuant to our By-Laws this indemnification may, at the Board’ s discretion, also include advancement of expenses
prior to the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding.
In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, pursuant to which
we have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each director against any and all liabilities
and assessments (including attorneys’ fees and other costs, expenses and obligations) arising out of or related to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or other ,
including, but not limited to, judgments,  fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (whether with or without court approval),
and any interest, assessments, excise taxes or other char ges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any
3
    
of the foregoing, incurred by the independent director and arising out of his status as a director or member of a committee of our
Board, or by reason of anything done or not done by the director in such capaci ties. After receipt of an appropriate request by an
independent director , we will also advance all expenses, costs and other obligations (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or
related to such matters. We will not be liable for payment of any liability or expense incurred by an independent director on
account of acts which, at the time taken, were known or believed by such director to be clearly in conflict with our best interests.
Certain Anti -Takeover Effects of North Car olina Law
The North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act generally requires the affirmative vote of 95% of a public corporation’ s
voting shares to approve a “business combination” with any entity that a majority of continuing directors determines beneficially
owns, directly or indirectly , more than 20% of the voting shares of the corporation (or ever owned, directly or indirectly , more
than 20% and is still an “affiliate” of the corporation) unless the fair price provisions and the procedural provisions of the North
Carolina Shareholder Protection Act are satisfied.
“Business combination” is defined by the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act as (i) any merger, consolidation or
conversion of a corporation with or into any other entity , or (ii) any sale or lease  of all or any substantial part of the corporation’ s
assets to any other entity, or (iii) any payment, sale or lease to the corporation or any subsidiary thereof in exchange for securities
of the corporation of any assets having an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than $5,000,000 of any other entity .
The North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act contains provisions that allowed a corporation to “opt out” of the
applicability of the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act’s voting provisions within specified time periods that generally
have expired. The Act applies to PepsiCo since we did not opt out within these time periods.
This statu te could discourage a third party from making a partial tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain a
substantial position in our equity securi ties or seeking to obtain control of us. It also might limit the price that certain investors
might be willing to pay in the future for our shares of common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change
of control of us.
DESCRIPTION OF NOTES
We have previously filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-177307), which was filed with the Securities

complete. The indenture has been incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this
exhibit is a part. You should read the indenture for the provisions which may be important to you. The indenture is subject to and

Ranking . The notes rank equally and pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of PepsiCo.
No Sinking Fund . No series of notes is subject to any sinking fund.
Additional Notes . We may, without the consent of the existing holders of the notes of a series, issue additional notes of
such serie s having the same terms (except issue date, date from which intere st accrues and, in some cases, the first interest
payment date) so that the existing notes of such series and the new notes of such series form a single series under the indenture.
As of February 4, 2021, no such additional notes have been issued.
Minimum Denominations . The sterling notes were issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples
of £1,000 in excess thereof. The euro notes were issued in minimum denominat ions of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000
in excess thereof.
Global Notes . The notes of each series are in the form of one or more global notes that we deposited with or on behalf of a
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V ., or its successor , as operator of the Euroclear System
(“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) and are registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary .
Paying Agent . We have  initially appointed The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch to act as paying agent and
transfer agent in connection with the notes as well as to serve as the common depositary for the notes. The Bank of New York
Mellon, London Branch is an affiliate of the trustee. The term “paying agent ” shall include The Bank of New York Mellon,
London Branch and any successors appointed from time to time in accordance with the provisions of the indenture.
Curr ency of Payment of Sterling Notes . The princ ipal and interest payments in respect of the sterling notes are payable in
sterling. If the United Kingdom adopts euro, in lieu of sterling, as its lawful currency , the sterling notes will be redenominated in
euro on a date determined by us, in our sole discretion, with a principal amount for each sterling note equal to the principal
amount of that note in sterling, converted into euro at the rate established by the applicable law; provided that, if we determine
after consultation with the paying agent that the then current market practice in respect of redenomination into euro of
internationally offered securities is different from the provisions specified abov e, such provisions will be deemed to be amended
so as to comply with such market practice and we will promptly notify the trustee and the paying
7
    
agent of such deem ed amendment. We will give 30 days’ notice of the redenomination date to the paying agent, the trustee,
Euroclear and Clearstream.
If sterling or, in the event the sterling notes are redenominated in euro, euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of
exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control (other than, with respect to sterling, due to the circumstances
described in the preceding paragraph but including the dissolution of the euro, if applicable), then all payments in respect of the
sterling notes will be made in U.S. dollars until sterling or euro, as the case may be, is again available to us. The amount payable
on any date in sterling or, in the event the sterling notes are redenominated in euro, euro will be converted to U.S. dollars on the
basis of the then most recently available market exchange rate for sterling or euro, as the case may be, as determined by us in our
sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the sterling notes so made in euro or U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default
under the sterling notes or the indenture governing the sterling notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall be responsible
for obtaining exchange rates, ef fecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations.
Curr ency of Payment of Euro Notes . The principal and interest payments in respect of the euro notes, including payments
made upon any redemption of any series of the euro notes, are payable in euro. If the euro is unavailable to us due to the
imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then
member states of the European Monetar y Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions
by public institution s of or within the international banking community , then all payments in respect of the euro notes will be
made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us and so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in
euro will be conver ted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the then most recently available market exchange rate for euro, as
determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the euro notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an
event of default under the euro notes or the indenture governing the euro notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall
have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing.
Definition of Business Day. The term “business day” with respect to the sterling notes means any day other than a
Saturday or Sunday or a day on which  banking institutions in the City of New York or the City of London are authorized or
required by law or executive order to close.
The term “business day” with respect to the euro notes means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday , (1) which is not a
day on which banking institutions in the City of New York or the City of Londo n are authorized or required by law or executive
order to close and (2) on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the
TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, operates. If any interest payment date,
8
maturity date or redemption date is not a business day, then the related paymen t for such interest payment date, maturity date or
redemption date shall be paid on the next succeeding business day with the same force and effect as if made on such interest
payment date, maturity date or redemption date, as the case may be, and no further interest shall accrue as a result of such delay .
Inter est Payments . Each series of notes will bear interest at the per annum rate stated in its title. Interest on the notes will
be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number
of days from and including the date from which interest begins to accrue for the period to, but excluding, the next scheduled
interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/AC TUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the
International Capital Markets Association.
Optional Redemption
Sterling Notes
We have the right at our option to redeem any of the sterling notes in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time
prior to their maturit y, on at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior notice mailed (or otherwise transmitted in accordance
with the procedures of the depositary) to the registered address of each holder of the sterling notes, at a redemption price
(calculated by us) equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such notes and (ii) the sum of the present values of
the Remaining Scheduled Payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusiv e of interest accrued to the date of redemption),
discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the Comparable Government Bond
Rate plus 13 basis points plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the date of redemption.
Definitions
“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places,
0.0005 being rounded upwards), at whic h the gross redemption yield on the sterling notes, if they were to be purchased at such
price on the third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such
business day of the Comparable Government Bond (as defined below) on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable
Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as determined by an independent investment
bank selected by us.
“Comparable Gover nment Bond” means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the
discretion of an independent investmen t bank selected by us, a United Kingdo m government bond whose maturity is closest to
the maturity of the sterling notes, or if such independent investment bank in its discretion considers that such similar bond is not
in
9
    
issue, such other United Kingdom government bond as such independent inves tment bank may, with the advice of three brokers
of, and/or market makers in, United Kingdom government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the
Comparable Government Bond Rate.
“Remaining Scheduled Payments” means, with respect to each sterling note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled
payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such
redemption; provided, however , that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such sterling note,
the amoun t of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of interest
accrued thereon to such redemption date.

Definitions
“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means, with respect to any redemption date for each series of euro notes, the price,
expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption
yield on such euro notes to be redeemed, if they were to be purchased at such price on the third business day prior to the date
fixed for redemption , would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such business day of the Comparable Government Bond
(as define d below) on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m.
(London time) on such business day as determined by an independent investment bank selected by us.
13
    
“Comparable Government Bond” means, with respect to each series of euro notes, in relation to any Comparable
Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent investment bank selected by us, a German government
bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the euro notes to be redeeme d, or if such independent investment bank in its
discretion considers  that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as such independent investment
bank may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to
be appropriate for determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.
“Remaining Schedu led Payments” means, with respect to each euro note of each series to be redeemed, the remaining
scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such
redemption; provide d, however , that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such euro note, the
amount of the next succeeding schedu led interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of interest
accrued thereon to such redemption date.
General
On and after the applicable redemption date with respect to a series of notes, interest will cease to accrue on such notes or
any portio n of such notes called for redemption (unless we default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest).
On or before the redemption date, we will deposit with the trustee or its agent  money sufficient to pay the redemption price of
and (unles s the redemption date shall be an interest payment date) accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date on the notes
to be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the notes of a series are to be redeemed, the notes of such series to be redeemed
shall be selected in accordance with applicable depositary procedures. Addition ally, we may at any time repurchase notes in the
open market and may hold or surrender such notes to the trustee for cancellation.
Notice of redemptio n will be transmitted at least 30 days (or 15 days with respect to the 2039 notes, or 10 days with
respect to the 2024  notes, May 2028 notes, 2032 notes and 2050 notes) but not more than 60 days before the applicable
redemption date to each holder of notes to be redeemed. We will be responsible  for calculating the redemption price of the notes

notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an event of default, will have happened and be continuing; and
•    we will have delivered to the truste e an opinion of counsel, stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance or
transfer complies with the indenture.
In the event of any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, any such successor will succeed to and be
substituted for us as obligor on the notes with the same effect as if it had been named in the indenture as obligor , and we will be
released from all obligations under the indenture and under the notes.

“Principal property” means any single manufacturing or processing plant, office building or warehouse owned or leased
by us or any of our restricted subsidiari es other than a plant, warehouse, office building or portion thereof which, in the opinion
of our Board of Directors, is not of material importance to the business conducted by us and our restricted subsidiaries taken as
an entirety .
“Restricted subsidiary” means, at any time, any subsidiary which at the time is not an unrestricted subsidiary of ours.
“Subsidiary” means any entity , at least a majority of the outstanding voting stock of which shall at the time be owned,
directly or indirectly , by us or by one or more of our subsidiaries, or both.
“Unrestricted subsid iary” means any subsidiary of ours (not at the time designated as our restricted subsidiary) (1) the
major part of whose business consists of finance, banking, credit, leasing, insurance, financial services or other similar
operations, or any combination thereof, (2) substantially all the assets of which consist of the capital stock of one or more
subsidiaries engaged  in the operations referred to in the preceding clause (1), or (3) designated as an unrestricted subsidiary by
our Board of Directors.
Events of Default
An “Event of Default” under the notes of a given series means:
(1)    default in paying interest on the notes when it becomes due and the default continues for a period of 30 days or
more;
(2)    default in paying principal, or premium, if any , on the notes when due;
(3)    default is made in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund or analogous obligation when the same becomes due,
and such default continues for 30 days or more;
(4)    default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of PepsiCo in the indenture (other than defaults
specified in clause (1), (2) or (3) above) and the
24
default or breach continues for a period  of 90 days or more after we receive written notice from the trustee or we
and the trustee receive notice from the holders of at least 51% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
notes of the series;
(5)    certain events of bankruptcy , insolvency , reorganization, administration or similar proceedings with respect to
PepsiCo have occurred; or
(6)    any other Events of Default set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5) with respect to PepsiCo) under the indenture
occurs with respect to the notes of any series and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least 51% in principal amount
of the outstanding notes of that series may by written notice require us to repay immediately the entire principal amount of the
outstanding notes of that series (or such lesser amount as may be provided in the terms of the notes), together with all accrued
and unpaid interest and premium, if any .
If an Event of Defau lt under the indentu re specified in clause (5) with respect to PepsiCo occurs and is continuing, then
the entire principal amount of the outstanding notes (or such lesser amount as may be provided in the terms of the notes) will
automatically become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder .
After a declaration of acceleration, the holders of not less than 51% in aggregate  principal amount of outstanding notes of
any series may rescind this accelerated payment requirement if all existing Events of Default, except for nonpayment of the
principal and interes t on the notes of that series that has become due solely as a result of the accelerated payment requirement,
have been  cured or waived and if the rescission of acceleration would not confl ict with any judgment or decree. The holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of any series also have the right to waive past defaults, except a default in
paying principal, premium or interest on any outstanding note, or in respect of a covenant or a provision that cannot be modified
or amended without the consent of all holders of the notes of that series.
Holders of at least 51% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of a serie s may seek to institute a proceeding only
after they have notif ied the trustee of a continuing Event of Default in writing and made a written request, and offered reasonable
indemnity , to the trustee to institute a proceeding and the trustee has failed to do so within 60 days after it received this notice. In
addition, within this 60 day period the trustee must not have received directions inconsistent with this written request by holders
of a majo rity in principal amount of the outstanding notes of that series. These limitations do not apply , however , to a suit
instituted by a holder of a note for the
25
    
enforcement of the payment of principal, interest or any premium on or after the due dates for such payment.
During the existence of an Event of Default, the trustee is required to exercise the rights and powers vested in it under the
indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent man would under the circumstances in the conduct
of that person’ s own affairs. If an Even t of Default has occurred and is conti nuing, the trustee is not under any obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers at the request or direction of any of the holders unless the holders have offered to the trustee
reasonable security or indemnity . Subject to certain provisions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
notes of any series have the right to direct the time, method and place of condu cting any proceeding for any remedy available to
the trustee, or exercising any trust, or power conferred on the trustee.
The trustee will, within 90 days after any default occurs, give notice of the default to the holders of the notes of that
series, unless the default was already cured or waived. Unless there is a default in paying principal, interest or any premium when
due, the trustee can withhold giving notice to the holders if it determines in good faith that the withholding of notice is in the
interest of the holders.
Modification and W aiver
The indenture may be amended or modified without the consent of any holder of notes in order to:
•    evidence a succession to the trustee;
•    cure ambiguities, defects or inconsistencies;
•    provide for the assumption of our obligations in the case of a merger or consolidation or transfer of all or substantially
all of our assets;
•    make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of the notes of a series;
•    add guarantors with respect to the notes of any series;
•    secure the notes of a series;
•    establish the form or forms of notes of any series;
•    maintain the qualification of the indenture under the T rust Indenture Act; or
26
•    make any change that does not adversely af fect in any material respect the interests of any holder .
Other amendments and modifications of the indenture or the notes issued may be made with the consent of the holders of
not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of each series affected by the amendment or
modification. However , no modification or amendment may , without the consent of the holder of each outstanding note af fected:
•    reduce the principal amount, interest or premium payable, or extend the fixed maturity , of the notes;
•    alter or waive the redemption provisions of the notes;
•    change the currency in which principal, any premium or interest is paid;
•    reduce  the percentage in principal amount outstanding of notes of any series which must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver or consent to take any action;
•    impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on the notes;
•    waive a payment default with respect to the notes or any guarantor;
•    reduce the interest rate or extend the time for payment of interest on the notes;
•    adversely af fect the ranking of the notes of any series; or
•    release  any guarantor from any of its obligations under its guarantee or the indenture, except in compliance with the
terms of the indenture.
Satisfaction, Discharge and Covenant Defeasance
We may terminate our obligations under the indenture, when:
•    either:
•    all the notes of any series issued that have been authenticated and delivered  have been delivered to the trustee
for cancellation; or
•    all the notes of any series issued that have not been delivered to the trustee  for cancellation have become due
and payable, will become due and payable within one year, or are to be called for redemption within one year
and we have made arrangements satisfactory to the trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by such
trustee in our name and at our expense, and in each case,
27
    
we have irrevocably deposited or caused  to be deposited with the trustee sufficient funds to pay and dischar ge
the entire indebtedness on the series of notes to pay principal, interest and any premium; and
•    we have paid or caused to be paid all other sums then due and payable under the indenture; and
•    we have delivered to the trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent under the indenture relating to the satisfaction and dischar ge of the indenture have been complied with.
We may elect to have our obligations under the indenture dischar ged with respect to the outstanding notes of any series
(“legal defeasance”). Legal defeasance means that we will be deemed to have paid and dischar ged the entire indebtedness
represented by the outstanding notes of such series under the indenture, except for:
•    the rights of holders of the notes to receive principal, interest and any premium when due;
•    our obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary notes, registration of transfer of the notes,
mutilated, destroyed , lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment for security
payments held in trust;
•    the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee; and
•    the defeasance provisions of the indenture.
In addition, we may elect to have our obligations released with respect to certa in covenants in the indenture (“covenant
defeasance”). Any omission to comply with these obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to
the notes of any series. In the event covenant defeasance occurs, certain events, not including non-payment, bankruptcy and
insolvency events, described under “Events of Default” above will no longer constitute an event of default for that series.
In order to exercise either legal defeasance or covenant defeasance with respect to outstanding notes of any series:
•    we must irrevoca bly have deposited or caused to be deposited with the truste e as trust funds for the purpose of making
the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to the benefit of the holders of the
notes of a series:
•    money in an amount;
28
•    U.S. government obligations (or equivalent government obligations in the case of notes denominated in other
than U.S. dollars or a specified currency) that will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any
payment, money in an amount; or
•    a combination of money and U.S. government obligations (or equivalent government obligations, as
applicable),
in each case sufficient, in the written  opinion (with respect to U.S. or equivalent government obligations or a
combination of money and U.S. or equivalent government obligations, as applicable) of a nationally recognized firm
of independent registered public accoun tants, to pay and dischar ge, and which shall be applied by the trustee to pay
and dischar ge, all of the principal (including mandatory sinking fund payments ), interest and any premium at the due
date or maturity;
•    in the case of legal defeasance, we must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that, under then
applicable federal income tax law, the holders of the notes of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, defeasance and dischar ge to be effected and will be subject to
the same federal income tax as would be the case if the deposit, defeasance and dischar ge did not occur;
•    in the case of covenant defeasance, we must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the
holders of the notes of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of the deposit  and covenant defeasance to be effected and will be subject to the same federal income tax as
would be the case if the deposit and covenant defeasance did not occur;
•    no event of default or default with respect to the outstanding notes of that series has occurred and is continuing at the
time of such depos it after giving effect to the deposit or, in the case of legal defeasance, no default relating to
bankruptcy or insolvency has occurred and is continuing at any time on or before the 91st day after the date of such
deposit, it being understood that this condition is not deemed satisfied until after the 91st day;
•    the legal defeasa nce or covenant defeasance will not cause the trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning
of the T rust Indenture Act, assuming all notes of a series were in default within the meaning of such Act;
29
    
•    the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under ,
any other agreement or instrument to which we are a party;
•    the legal defea sance or covenant defeasance will not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an
investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, unless the trust is
registered under such Act or exempt from registration; and
•    we must have delivered to the trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel stating that all conditions
precedent with respect to the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance have been complied with.
Book-Entry , Delivery and Settlement
We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream and Euroclear and their book-entry systems and
procedures from sources that we believe  to be reliable. We take no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In
addition, the description of the clearin g systems in this section reflects our understanding of the rules and procedures of
Clearstream and Euroclear as they are currently in effect. Those clearing system s could change their rules and procedures at any
time.
The notes of each series were initially represented by one or more fully registered global notes. Each such global note was
deposited with, or on behalf of, a comm on depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for
the accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear . Except as set forth below , the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in
part, only to Eurocl ear or Clearstream or their respective nominees. You may hold your interests in the global notes in Europe
through Clearstream or Euroclear , either as a participant in such systems or indirectly through organizations which are
participants in such systems. Clearstrea m and Euroclear will hold interests in the global notes on behalf of their respective
participating organiz ations or customers through customers’ securities accoun ts in Clearstream’ s or Euroclear ’s names on the
books of their respe ctive depositaries. Book-entry interests in the notes and all transfers relating to the notes will be reflected in
the book-entry records of Clearstream and Euroclear . The address of Clearstream is 42 A venue JF Kennedy , L-1855 Luxembour g,
Luxembour g and the address of Euroclear is 1 Boulevard Roi Albert II, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium.
The distribution of the notes was cleared through Clearstream and Euroclear . Any secondary market trading of book-entry
interests in the notes  will take place through Clearstream and Euroclear particip ants and will settle in same-day funds. Owners of
book-entry interests in
30
the notes will receiv e payments relating to their notes in sterling with respect to the sterling notes and euro with respect to the
euro notes, except as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.
Clearstream and Euroclear have estab lished electronic securities and payment transfer , processing, depositary and
custodial links among themselves and others, either directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links allow the notes to
be issued,  held and transferred among the clearing systems without the physical transfer of certificates. Special procedures to
facilitate clearance and settlement have been established among these clearing  systems to trade securities across borders in the
secondary market.
The policies of Clearstream and Euroclear govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to the
investor ’s interest in the notes held by them. We have no responsibility for any aspect of the records kept by Clearstream or
Euroclear or any of their direct or indirect participants. W e also do not supervise these systems in any way .
Clearstream and Euroclear and their participants perform these clearance and settlement functions under agreements they
have made with one another or with their customers. You should be aware that they are not obligated to perform or continue to
perform these procedures and may modify them or discontinue them at any time.
Except as provided otherwise, owners of beneficial interests in the notes will not be entitled to have the notes registered in
their name s, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the notes in definitive form and will not be considered
the owners or holde rs of the notes under the indenture, including for purposes  of receiving any reports delivered by us or the
trustee pursuant to the indenture. Accordingly , each person owning a beneficial interest in a note must rely on the procedures of
the depositary and, if such person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its
interest, in order to exercise any rights of a holder of notes.
Certificated Notes . Subject to certain  conditions, the notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for
certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor in minimum denominations of £100,000 principal amount and integral multiples
of £1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the sterling notes and €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof with respect to the euro notes if:
(1)    the common depositary provides notification that it is unwilling, unab le or no longer qualified to continue as
depositary for the global notes and a successor is not appointed within 90 days;
31
    
(2)    we in our discretion at any time determine not to have all the notes of any series represented by the global note; or
(3)    default entitling the holders of the applicable notes of any series to accelerate the maturity thereof has occurred and
is continuing.
Any note of any series that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes of such series issuable in
authorized denominations and registered  in such names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a global
note is not exchang eable, except for a global note of the same aggregate denomination to be registered in the name of the
common depositary (or its nominee).
Same-day Payment . Payments (including principal, interes t and any additional amounts) and transfers with respect to
notes of any series in certificated form may be executed at the office or agency maintained for such purpose within the City of
London (initially the office of the paying agent maintained for such purpose) or, at our option, by check mailed to the holders
thereof at the respective addresses set forth in the register of holders of the applicable notes of such series, provided that all
payments (including principal, interest and any additional amounts) on notes in certificated form, for which the holders thereof
have given  wire transfer instructions, will be required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
specified by the holders thereof. No service charge will be made for any registr ation of transfer , but payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or governmental char ge payable in connection with that registration may be required.

ARTICLE I - HIST ORY AND GENERAL INFORMA TION
    The Plan came into operation on and took ef fect from September 1, 1980, and was comprised of the “PepsiCo International
Retirement Plan T rust Indenture” and the “Plan Rules”, and was later amended and restated in its entirety , effective September 2,
1982.
The Plan was further amended and restated in its entirety , effective October 1, 2003, whereupon the Plan Rules became
the “Plan A Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation’ s contributions to the trust established by the PepsiCo
International Retirement Plan T rust Indenture) and the “Plan B Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation as they
arise) took ef fect.
The Plan was further amended ef fective January 1, 2005, so that no person subject to taxation in the United States of
America may in any way have their right to a benefit from the Plan come into existence, increase or in any way be enhanced, but
instead will be determined as if they had left the Corporation and any Associated Company permanently before becoming subject
to U.S. taxation.
Effective January 1, 2010, the Plan A Rules and Plan B Rules were amended and restated in their entirety to form a single
governing legal document, as set forth herein. The terms of the Plan set forth in this amended and restated governing legal
document are known as the “DB Program” (also known as “PIRP-DB”). This amended and restated governing legal document
shall apply to Members who are in Membership from and after January 1, 2010, as well as any others who claim rights from and
after January 1, 2010 that are derived from current or former Membership, including former Members and the Dependants and
Eligible Spouses of Members and former Members. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the amendment and
restatement of this Plan, the supersession of the prior documents by this Plan, and the prior existence of separate Plan A and Plan
B Rules shall not at any time result in any duplication of benefits (nor shall duplication of benefits result from any other factor or
circumstance related to this Plan or any prior version of this Plan).
    Ef fective January 1, 201 1, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit
selected international employees for whom it has been determined to be appropriate (i.e., employees on assignments outside of
their home countries for whom it is judged to be impracticable to have them participate in their home country retirement plans
and employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages). The terms of the
DC Program are set forth in a separate governing legal document. Together , the DC Program and the DB Program set forth the
terms of a single Plan.
    The DB Program was previously amended and restated, ef fective January 1, 2016. The DB Program was again amended
and restated, ef fective January 1, 2019. The DB Program is hereby amended and restated ef fective January 1, 2021 (the
“Restatement Date”) to freeze the DB Program ef fective as of the end of the day on December 31, 2025. As a result, ef fective on
and after January 1, 2026, all accruals under the DB Program, as well as all Pensionable Service,
1
Salary and other compensation that are recognized under the Plan, are treated as ending no later than at the end of the day on
December 31, 2025, and where the DB Program requires that Salary or other compensation be averaged over a period of service,
service after December 31, 2025 is not taken into account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in accordance with the DB Program’ s
usual rules that would apply in the absence of the DB Program freeze, a Member shall continue to earn Service (for purposes of
determining whether the Member has a vested right to a Pension) and entitlement Service (for purposes of applying more
favorable early retirement factors under the DB Program) and shall be permitted to meet any related age threshold relevant to
qualify for such early retirement factors while still an Employee, even after December 31, 2025. In addition, the portion of the
formula that requires projecting and prorating a Member ’s benefit, the denominator of the applicable fraction is projected to
include service after December 31, 2025 as if the DB Program were not going to freeze while the numerator of the fraction is
calculated taking into account the December 31, 2025 freeze, and then the resulting fraction is frozen as of December 31, 2025; a
Member shall continue to earn Service and shall be permitted to meet any related age threshold while still an Employee that
would result in the inapplicability of the projecting and prorating formula even after December 31, 2025.
At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the United States Internal Revenue Code and Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that
executive’ s individual employer . With respect to his employer , the executive has the rights of an unsecured general creditor . The
Plan is also intended to be exempt from ERISA as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of
persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States.

Member's Single Life Annuity benefit determined in accordance with T able A (or for Annuity Starting Dates
before January 1, 2019, the T able A amount reduced by 5 percent, subject to subsection (f) below).
(c) Lump Sum Payment : Subject to Section 5.04, a Member who elects not to receive benefits in the normal form
may elect to receive payment of his Pension in the form of a single lump sum payment. The amount of the single lump
sum payment shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Single Life Annuity , determined in accordance with T able A,
utilizing the lump sum equivalent factors applicable to lump sum distributions under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan
(disregarding transition factors), calculated as of the date payments would have commenced under the normal form of
benefit or other optional benefit. The lump sum payment shall be made in one taxable year of the Member and shall be
paid as soon as practicable after the date specified by the Member in his written election. Effective for lump sum
payments due to be paid on or after January 1, 2010, interest will be added to late lump sum payments in accordance with
the administrative practices of the PepsiCo Salaried Plan. No interest shall be payable on such sum during any such
deferred period specified by the Member .
(d) Combination Lump Sum/Monthly Benefit : Subject to Section 5.04, a married or unmarried Member who elects
not to receive his Pension in the normal form may elect to receive payment of his Pension in the form of a combination
lump sum/monthly benefit option. If elected, the Member shall receive a portion of his benefit in the form of
17
a lump sum payment, and the remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits described in Sections 5.02 and
5.03. The benefit shall be divided between the two forms of payment based on the whole number percentages designated
by the Member on a form provided for this purpose. To be ef fective, the two percentages designated by the Member must
add to 100 percent.
(1) The amount of the benefit paid in the form of a lump sum is determined by multiplying: (A) the amount
determined under Section 5.03(c) by (B) the percentage that the Member has designated for receipt in the form of
a lump sum.
(2) The amount of the benefit paid in the form of a monthly benefit is determined by multiplying: (A) the
amount of the monthly benefit elected by the Member , determined in accordance with Sections 5.03(a) or (b), by
(B) the percentage that the Member has designated for receipt in the form of a monthly benefit.
(e) Death Prior to Pension Becoming Payable : If a Member who is entitled to an immediate Pension under Article
IV elects an optional form of payment under this Section 5.03, if such election meets all requirements to be ef fective
(other than the Member ’s survival, but including the time for making the election and any necessary Eligible Spouse’ s
consent), and thereafter the Member dies after leaving employment but before such Pension becomes payable, then on the
first day of the month next following his death such optional form of payment shall be deemed to be in ef fect. Such
deemed ef fectiveness may only apply once and only to the initial election made by a Member (except as permitted by a
decision of the V ice President that is made prior to the Member ’s submission of a subsequent purported election).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of the option under Section 5.03(b), if the Member ’s specified Dependant has
died or shall die before the date on which the first installment of the Member ’s Pension was prospectively payable in
accordance with the optional form of payment elected by the Member , the Member ’s election of such optional form shall
not be given ef fect.
(f) Reduction for Certain Y ounger Dependants : Notwithstanding the reduction factors specified in Sections 5.02(b)
and 5.03, in the case of Annuity Starting Dates before January 1, 2019, a Member electing a form of payment that
includes a survivor option shall have his Pension reduced in accordance with this subsection (f) in the event the
Dependant under such survivor option is more than 10 years younger than the Member .
(1) Not More than 20 Y ears Y ounger : In the event the Dependant is more than 10 years younger than the
Member , but not more than 20 years younger , the percentage reduction that otherwise would apply shall be
increased by 5 percentage points.
18
(2) More than 20 Y ears Y ounger : In the event the Dependant is more than 20 years younger than the
Member , the 5 percentage point increase in the reduction provided in (1) above shall be further increased by an
additional 0.2 percent for each full year over 20.
5.04    Applicability of Certain Options.
    Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article V , the availability of certain distribution options shall be restricted in
accordance with the terms of this Section 5.04.
    (a) Pre-1990 Distributions : The form of payment described in Section 5.03(d) above shall not be available unless the
Member's Annuity Starting Date is after 1989.
(b) Deferred V ested Pensions : Deferred V ested Pensions under Section 4.04 shall be eligible for payment only
under the Single Life Annuity , the 50 Percent Survivor Option or the 75 Percent Survivor Option, except as provided in
the next sentence. Effective as of January 1, 2015, Deferred V ested Pensions under Section 4.04 shall also be eligible for
the Lump Sum Payment option, but only to the limited extent that such option is available on an on-going basis with
respect to deferred vested pensions under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan (except that unlike participants in the PepsiCo
Salaried Plan, participants in this Plan with a benefit under the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan shall not be excluded
from the Lump Sum Payment option).
(c) Simplified Actuarial Factors : In the case of a Member who became entitled to a Pension prior to January 1,
1990, the actuarial equivalencies described in the preceding provisions of this Article V shall be adjusted as provided by
the V ice President from time to time to reflect the value of any subsidized survivor benefit to which the Member is
entitled under the last sentence of Section 5.02(b) (regarding the availability on favorable terms of the survivor benefit
described in Section 5.02(b)).
5.05    Cashout of Certain Benefits.
        (a) Cashout of Small Benefits . Where the total Pension payable to any person under the DB Program is, in the opinion of the
Vice President, of an amount that is relatively trivial (when considered by itself or in relation to the potential
administrative burden of continuing to keep track of such Pension under the DB Program), he may commute the whole of
such Pension to a lump sum payable following (i) the relevant Member ’s termination of employment from both his
Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization, or (ii) a Member ’s transfer within the PepsiCo Or ganization that results in the
Member ceasing to actively accrue all benefits under the DB Program, on a date determined in the discretion of the V ice
President, without the consent of the Member .
(b) Discretionary Cashout After Benefit Commencement . Effective January 1, 2019, the V ice President shall have
the discretion to make a lump-sum payment to any Member whose benefit payments have commenced (in a form other
than a lump-sum), if
19
the present value of the Member ’s remaining stream of payments is less than on equal to $75,000 on the payment date.
The amount of the lump sum payment shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Member ’s remaining stream of payments,
determined utilizing the lump sum equivalent factors specified in Section 5.03(c) calculated as of the a payment date
determined in the discretion of the V ice President.
5.06    Designation of Dependant.
A Member who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor option shall
designate a Dependant who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death. A Member shall have the right to change or
revoke his Dependant designation at any time prior to the ef fective date of his election. If the Member is married at the time he
designates a Dependant, any designation under this section of a Dependant who is not the Member ’s Eligible Spouse shall require
the written consent of the Member ’s Eligible Spouse. A revocation of a Dependant does not require consent by the Member ’s
Eligible Spouse. The designation of any Dependant, and any change or revocation thereof, and any written consent of a
Member ’s Eligible Spouse required by this Section shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the V ice President, shall be
made in writing on forms provided by the V ice President, and shall not be ef fective unless and until filed with the V ice President.
In the case of the survivor option described in Section 5.03(b)(4), the following shall apply: (i) the Member shall be entitled to
name both a primary Dependant and a contingent Dependant, and (ii) if no Dependant is properly designated, then a Member ’s
election of such option will not be given ef fect.
20
ARTICLE VI - DEA TH BENEFITS
The surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as applicable, of a Member who dies shall be entitled to
certain survivor benefits if the requirements of this Article VI are satisfied. Except as provided in Sections 6.02 and 6.03, the
amount of any such benefit shall be determined in accordance with Section II of T able A.
6.01    Active and Retir ement-Eligible Members.
    In the event of the death of an Active Member , a Member in Service after his Normal Retirement Date who had at his death
completed at least 5 years of Service, or a Member entitled to an Early Retirement Pension under Section 4.02 or Special Early
Retirement Pension under Section 4.03, if such Member is survived by an Eligible Spouse or an Eligible Domestic Partner and is
not entitled at the time of death to the protection provided by Section 5.03(e), there shall be a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or
Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension payable to the Member ’s surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner (as
applicable), calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section II of T able A.
6.02    Vested Members.
    In the event of the death of a Member who is not described in Section 6.01 above, who is vested under Section 4.06 or Section
4.07 and who has not yet commenced or received the Member ’s Pension, if such Member is survived by an Eligible Spouse or an
Eligible Domestic Partner and is not entitled at the time of death to the protections provided by Section 5.03(e), there shall be
payable a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension (as applicable), which shall be
calculated based on the Member ’s Salary and Pensionable Service as of the earlier of the Member ’s death or termination of
employment. The benefit shall be calculated as if the Member lived until the earliest date the Member ’s vested benefit could have
started, after having elected to start his benefit at that time in the form of a 50 Percent Survivor Annuity , and died that same day .
    Coverage for this Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension shall be paid for with a
reduction to the monthly benefit otherwise payable to the Member . The reduction char ged to the Member ’s benefit shall be
calculated in accordance with the methodology , and based on the same factors, provided for under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan, as
in effect from time to time. The Member may only waive this Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension coverage or Pre-Retirement
Domestic Partner ’s Coverage (as applicable) with the approval of the V ice President.
6.03    Form and T ime of Payment of Death Benefits.
(a) Form of Payment:  Any Pension payable pursuant to this Article VI shall be payable for the surviving Eligible
Spouse’ s or surviving Domestic Partner ’s life only;
21
however , in the case of a Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse or surviving Domestic Partner where the
Member was eligible for a Normal, Early or Special Early Retirement Pension at death, the Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner may elect to receive the Pension in the form of a single lump sum payment in lieu of the annuity
payment.
(b) Time of Payment:  Subject to Section 6.04, any Pension payable to the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic
Partner under this Article VI shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the
Member ’s death, or if later , the date on which the Member would have attained age 55. In the event a Pension payable to a
Member ’s Eligible Spouse commences before the Member would have reached Normal Retirement Age, the benefit will
be reduced as set forth in Section 4.02, 4.03 or 4.04, as applicable based on the Pension to which the Member was
entitled, to reflect early commencement.
6.04    Disposition of Death Benefits.
    Any benefit expressed to be subject to disposition in accordance with the provision of this Article VI shall be held by the V ice
President with power to pay or apply the same to or for the benefit of such one or more of the Member ’s Dependants, as the V ice
President shall think fit and if more than one in such shares as they shall likewise think fit. Notwithstanding any other provision
of the DC Program, the V ice President may direct that such benefit shall commence or be paid in a lump sum as soon as
practicable after the Member ’s date of death.
22
ARTICLE VII - ADMINISTRA TION
7.01    Authority to Administer Plan.
(a) Administration by the V ice President:  The Plan shall be administered by the V ice President, who shall have the
authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as he deems appropriate. All actions by the V ice President
hereunder may be taken in his sole discretion, and all interpretations, determinations and regulations made or issued by
the V ice President shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned.
(b) Authority to Delegate:  The V ice President may delegate any of his responsibilities under the Plan to other
persons or entities, or designate or employ other persons to carry out any of his duties, responsibilities or other functions
under the Plan. Any reference in the Plan to an action by the V ice President shall, to the extent applicable, refer to such
action by the V ice President’ s delegate or other designated person.
7.02    Facility of Payment.
Whenever , in the opinion of the V ice President, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit or installment
thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the
Vice President may direct that payments from the Plan be made to such person’ s legal representative for his benefit, or that the
payment be applied for the benefit of such person in such manner as the V ice President considers advisable. Any payment of a
benefit or installment thereof in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete dischar ge of any liability for
the making of such payment under the provisions of the Plan.
7.03    Claims Pr ocedur e.
    The V ice President shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions
of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits, and his decisions on such matters are final and conclusive.
As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the V ice President decides in his discretion that the person claiming such
benefits is entitled to them. This discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case where the extent of this
discretion is in question, the V ice President is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary
authority shall be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the abuse of
discretion standard). If, pursuant to this discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Member
or Dependant (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the V ice President, or a party designated by the V ice President, will
provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the V ice President, a comprehensible written
notice setting forth:
23
(1) The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
(2) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(3) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the claim
and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
(4) A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process).
If the V ice President determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim he may
extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the V ice President will notify the claimant before the end of the
initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President
expects to make the final decision. Upon review , the V ice President shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim,
including the opportunity to submit to the V ice President comments, document, records and other information relevant to the
claim and the V ice President’ s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of
whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after
receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this
occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special
circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President expects to make the final decision. The final
decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the
decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to
receive, upon request and free of char ge, copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his or her claim for
benefits.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis
of the record before the V ice President at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on
the claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this section.
7.04    Limitations on Actions.
Any claim filed under Article VII and any action filed in any court or other tribunal by or on behalf of a former or current
Employee, Member , Dependant or any other individual, person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful
denial of Plan benefits must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of
this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than
earlier of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action; (ii)
the date identified to the Petitioner by the V ice President on which payments shall commence; or (iii) when he has actual
24
or constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within
this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of
action. Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals process described above shall have no ef fect
on this two-year time frame.
7.05    Restriction of V enue.
Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner shall
only be brought or filed in the state or federal courts of New Y ork, specifically the state or federal court, whichever applies,
located nearest the Corporation’ s headquarters.
7.06    Effect of Specific Refer ences.
Specific references in the Plan to the V ice President’ s discretion shall create no inference that the V ice President’ s
discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.
25
ARTICLE VIII - AMENDMENT AND TERMINA TION
8.01    Continuation of the Plan.
While the Corporation intends to continue the Plan indefinitely , it assumes no contractual obligation as to its continuance.
The Corporation hereby reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any time
provided, however , that no such amendment or termination shall adversely af fect the amount of benefit to which a Member or his
Dependant is entitled under the Plan on the date of such amendment or termination, unless the Member becomes entitled to an
amount equal to such benefit under another plan or practice adopted by the Corporation. Specific forms of payment are not
protected under the preceding sentence.
8.02    Amendment.
The Corporation may , in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to the Plan from time to time, with or
without retroactive ef fect, subject to Section 8.01. An Employer (other than the Corporation) shall not have the right to amend the
Plan.
8.03    Termination.
The Corporation may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as to the participation of one or more Employers.
If the Plan is terminated with respect to fewer than all of the Employers, the Plan shall continue in ef fect for the benefit of the
employees of the remaining Employers.
26
ARTICLE IX - MISCELLANEOUS
9.01    Unfunded Plan.
The Employers’ obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Employer payable
when due out of the Employer ’s general funds. To the extent a Member or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits
under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Employer .
9.02    Costs of the Plan.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Corporation, all costs, char ges and expenses of or incidental to the administration and
management of the Plan shall be the costs, char ges and expenses of the Employers and shall be paid by each Employer based on
the proportion of Members who are employed by such Employer as compared to the total number of Members at the time the cost
or expense is incurred.
9.03    Temporary Absence of Member .
If a Member is absent from duty by reason other than death, dischar ge, retirement or quitting ( e.g., sickness, accident,
layof f, vacation), he shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that is 12 months after the date on which he is
absent, unless the V ice President determines otherwise. If the Member ’s absence from duty is by reason of his service as a full-
time member of the armed forces of any country or of any or ganization engaged in national service of any such country , he shall
not be deemed to have terminated employment so long as he is regarded by the Employer as remaining in employment or until he
shall resign permanently from employment, whichever shall first occur .
9.04    Taxes, Etc.
In the event any tax or assessment or other duty is determined by the V ice President to be owing in respect of any benefit
payable from the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to withhold an amount not exceeding the amount of any such tax or assessment
or other duty from the benefit payable and shall apply the same in satisfaction of said tax or assessment or other duty .
9.05    Nonguarantee of Employment.
Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any of its employees, or as
a right of any such employee to continue in the employment of the Employer , or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to
dischar ge any of its employees, with or without cause.
27
9.06    No Right to Benefits.
No person, whether or not being a Member , shall have any claim, right or interest under the Plan except as provided by
the terms of the Plan. In the event of a Member ’s termination of employment by an Employer , the resulting cessation of his
Active Membership shall not be grounds for any damages or any increase in damages in any action brought against the Employer
or any member of the PepsiCo Or ganization with respect to such termination.
9.07    Charges on Benefits and Recovery of Excess Payments.
All benefits in respect of a Member under the Plan shall stand char ged with and be subject to deductions therefrom of all
sums in respect of losses to a member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer or otherwise caused by misdemeanor of the
Member and on production by the member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer of proof satisfactory to the V ice President
that any such loss ought to be made good by a Member . The relevant amount shall be deductible from the Member ’s benefits and
be payable to the Employer or member of the PepsiCo Or ganization whose receipt shall be a valid dischar ge for the same.
Payments to, for or in connection with a Member that are made (as of a point in time and to any person or entity) may not
exceed the exact amount of payments that are due as of such time and to such person, as provided by the terms of the Plan that
specify the amounts that are payable, the time as of which they are payable, and the person to whom they are payable.
Accordingly , any such excess payment or any other overpayment, premature payment or misdirected payment (one or more of
which are hereafter referred to as an “Excess Payment”) may not be retained by the party receiving it, but must be restored
promptly to the Plan. In exchange for Member or Dependant status hereunder (or for having any other direct or indirect right or
claim of right from the Plan, or solely as a result of having received an Excess Payment), any party receiving an Excess Payment
grants to the Plan the following nonexclusive rights –
(1)    A constructive trust and first priority equitable lien on any payment that is received directly or
indirectly from the Plan and that is, in whole or part, an Excess Payment (such trust and lien shall be equal to the
amount of the Excess Payment increased by appropriate interest) or upon the proceeds or substitutes for such
payment, and any transfer shall be subject to such constructive trust and equitable lien (including a transfer to a
person, trust fund or entity).
(2)    The right to of fset (as necessary to recover the Excess Payment with appropriate interest)
other payments that are properly payable by the Plan to the recipient of the Excess Payment; however , reliance on
this right is in the discretion of the V ice President, and the existence of an opportunity to apply it shall not
diminish the Plan’ s rights under paragraph (1) above.
(3)    The right to bring any equitable or legal action or proceeding with respect to the enforcement
of any rights in this Section in any court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect, and following receipt of
an
28
Excess Payment the Member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving any and all rights that may
correspond to such party’ s present or future residence.
Any party receiving an Excess Payment shall promptly take all actions requested by the V ice President that are in
furtherance of the Plan’ s recovery of the Excess Payment with appropriate interest. In all cases, this subsection shall
maximize the rights of the Plan to recover improper payments and shall not restrict the rights of the Plan in any way ,
including with respect to any improper payment that is not addressed above.
9.08    Termination for Cause; Pr ohibited Misconduct.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the V ice President determines that a
Member has been terminated for cause or engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary
of the date his or her employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization terminates, the Member shall forfeit his Pension
(whether paid previously , being paid currently or payable in the future), and his or her Pension shall be adjusted to reflect
such forfeiture and any previously paid Pension payments shall be recovered. As a condition to Membership in this Plan,
each Member agrees to this, and each Member agrees to repay PepsiCo the amounts it seeks to recover under this Section
9.08.
(b) Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly , by a Member shall constitute Prohibited
Misconduct:
(1) The Member accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility , or acquiring any
ownership interest, which involves the Member ’s “Participation” (as defined below) in a business entity that
markets, sells, distributes or produces “Covered Products” (as defined below), unless such business entity makes
retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
(2) The Member , directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Member ’s
recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Or ganization employee to leave the
PepsiCo Or ganization’ s employment or to accept any position with any other entity .
(3) The Member using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo
Organization other than as necessary in his or her position with the PepsiCo Or ganization. Such confidential

PepsiCo Or ganization’ s customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition tar gets; its business operations
and structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes,
29
machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.
(4) The Member engaging in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the PepsiCo Or ganization’ s best
interests, including violating the Corporation’ s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of
the Corporation or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his or her employment with
the PepsiCo Or ganization, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
(5) The Member engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Member from
communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the Corporation,
participating in government investigations, and/or receiving any applicable award for providing information to
government authorities. The Corporation nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any
information appropriately protected by the privilege. Further , pursuant to the Defend T rade Secrets Act, an individual
shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret

attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a
complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who
files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the
attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any
document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order .
For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director , officer,
employee, consultant or contractor with respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or
suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or testimonial on behalf of such a business

9.09    Notices.
Any notice which under the Plan is required to be given to or served upon the Plan shall be deemed to be suf ficiently
given to or served upon the Plan if it is in writing and delivered to the V ice President. In any case where under the Plan any
notice shall be required to be given to Members, it shall be suf ficient if such notice is delivered to the Member ’s last known
address on file in the records of the Employer or delivered to the Member pursuant to any other method ( e.g., electronically) that
the V ice President determines is reasonably available to the Member .
9.10    Plan Documentation.

to time.
9.12    Governing Law .
The Plan shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New Y ork.
9.13    Exemption fr om ERISA.
The Plan is intended to be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”),
as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident
aliens of the United States. In order to preserve this exemption from ERISA, both Active Membership in the Plan and the
opportunity to increase Highest A verage Monthly Earnings after ceasing to be an Active Member , in accordance with Section
4.04(b), shall be limited to individuals who are nonresident aliens of the United States and whose assigned work locations are
outside the United States, and it is intended that all permanent records and documentation relating to the administration of the
Plan shall be kept at a location that is outside of the United States.
9.14    Exemption fr om Section 409A.
In order to permit this Plan to be completely exempt from United States Internal Revenue Code section 409A (“Section
409A”), this Plan shall be subject to the special operating rules and limitations in this Section 9.14, ef fective for any period to
which Section 409A applies. It is the
31
intent of the Plan that no Member who is a U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit from the Plan vest, increase or in any
way be enhanced (collectively , a “Benefit Enhancement”) as a result of their compensation or service while a U.S. Person.
Accordingly , no Member shall become entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a calendar year until it is determined,
following the close of such year , that the Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such year . Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, in the calendar year a Member ’s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence, the V ice President may authorize a
Benefit Enhancement for the calendar year of benefit commencement to the extent the V ice President determines satisfactorily
that the Member will not be a U.S. Person for such year . In other cases, the Member ’s benefit will commence under this Plan
without any Benefit Enhancement related to the calendar year of commencement, and appropriate adjustments will be made to
the Member ’s benefit in the following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person in such calendar year of
commencement. This Section 9.14 shall at all times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the overriding requirement that
benefits and any other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A, and the V ice President shall have
such unrestricted authority as is necessary to ensure that it is applied in accordance with this requirement.

TABLE A - CALCULA TION OF PENSIONS
    This section sets forth the formulas for calculating the Pension payable to a Member under Article IV or the Death Benefit
payable to a Member ’s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as applicable, under Article VI, but subject in all cases to
the freeze of the Plan described in Article I. Any benefits accrued under the DB Program by a Member while a part-time
employee, following such Member ’s designation by the V ice President as an Eligible Employee pursuant to the last sentence of
the definition of Eligible Employee in Section 2.01, shall be prorated as determined by the V ice President to reflect the
approximate ratio of the Member ’s level of services during such part-time status to the level required for full-time status at the
Member ’s work location.
(I)    Member ’s Pension
(a)    The Pension payable (as a Single Life Annuity benefit) on retirement at Normal Retirement Date for Members who
became members of the Plan before January 1, 1976 shall be the larger of the Pension calculated under this paragraph (a) or
under paragraph (b) below . The Pension under this paragraph (a) shall be the greater  of (1) or (2) below:
    (1)    1.5 percent of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the number of
years of Pensionable Service; or
    (2)    3 percent of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary , multiplied by the number of years of his Pensionable
Service but not exceeding 15 years.
(b)    The Pension payable (as a Single Life Annuity benefit) on retirement at Normal Retirement Date (i) for Members
who became members of the Plan on or after January 1, 1976, and (ii) for persons (other than those in (i)) who became Members
on or after September 1, 1980, and (iii) for persons (other than in (i) or (ii)) who became Members after November 12, 1998,
shall be the Pension calculated under this paragraph (b). The pension calculated under this paragraph (b) shall be the aggregate
of:
(1)    For up to the first 10 years of Pensionable Service, the product of (i) 3 percent of the Member ’s Highest
Average Monthly Salary , multiplied by (ii) the number of years of Pensionable Service, but not exceeding 10 such years;
plus
(2)    For any years of Pensionable Service in excess of 10, the product of (i) 1 percent of the Member ’s Highest
Average Monthly Salary , multiplied by (ii) the number of years of Pensionable Service in excess of 10.
(c)    At the discretion of the V ice President, the Pension calculated as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be
reduced by some or all of the following:
34
(1)    All state pension and social security benefits receivable by the Member attributable to Service other than
those derived from unmatched and unreimbursed voluntary contributions made by the Member;
(2)    The annuity equivalent of a like portion of all capital sum benefits receivable by the Member on or by reason
of his retirement either from a state source or from the Employer in consequence of a requirement of local legislation,
including, but not limited to, termination indemnities;
(3)    Any benefits payable to the Member (or in respect of him) from other retirement benefit plans (or cash
allowance received in lieu of Employer contributions to a retirement benefit plan) of the Employers in respect of any
period of employment which qualifies as Pensionable Service both under the DB Program and under such other
retirement benefit plans of the Employers;
(4)    Any other payment made by the Employer at the time of termination of the Member that arises from any
severance agreement made between the Employer and Member , for whatsoever reason;
    (5)    The value (as determined in accordance with methodology approved by the V ice President) of any benefits paid to
the Member prior to his retirement from any plan in respect of any period of employment which qualifies as Pensionable
Service both under the DB Program and under such other retirement benefit plans of the Employers;
(6)    Any deductions, reductions or forfeiture of a Member's benefits resulting from a Member's misdemeanor ,
misconduct or dischar ge for cause pursuant to Section 9.08 hereof.
No such deduction shall be made in respect of any such benefits as are derived from unmatched and unreimbursed
voluntary contributions made by the Member . The value of all such deductions shall be subject to adjustment to reflect the form
and timing of payment. All deductions set out in this paragraph (c) shall be calculated as of the Member ’s termination date and in
accordance with methodology approved by the V ice President from time to time.
(d)    If the Pension payable to or on behalf of a Member is reduced under paragraph (c) above, an alternative calculation
of the Pension for such Member shall apply unless the V ice President determines that the alternative calculation would be
unnecessary or impractical or would not serve the purposes of the DB Program. Under this alternative calculation, only the
Member ’s Pensionable Service under this DB Program, which does not include any employment that is taken into account in
determining benefits under paragraph (c)(1) - (5), shall be considered, and the reductions under paragraph (c)(1) - (5) shall be
disregarded (however , the reduction under paragraph (c)(6) shall be taken into account). If this alternative calculation applies, the
Pension payable under this alternative calculation shall be compared to the Pension payable under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)
above, and whichever provides the greater Pension amount will be payable to or on behalf of the Member , subject to the
remaining provisions of this
35
paragraph (d). The alternative calculation set forth in this paragraph (d) is intended to provide a calculation methodology that
replicates the ef fect of the “extended wearaway” calculation methodology , as it is in ef fect from time to time under the PepsiCo
Salaried Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this paragraph (d), any benefit increase provided as a result of this
paragraph (d) will be limited so that in the judgment of the V ice President it is not in excess of what should be available given the
intent described in the preceding sentence.
(e)    For purposes of this T able A, "Highest A verage Monthly Salary" means one twelfth of the yearly average of the
Member ’s Salary over any 5 consecutive calendar years of Service in which such Salary was highest (or over such lesser period
as the Member has been in Service). For purposes of determining a Member's Highest A verage Monthly Salary , the following
shall apply:
    (1)    A calendar year with no Salary shall be disregarded, and the calendar years preceding and following such calendar
year (or years) shall be considered consecutive.
(2)    If in a calendar year there is an unpaid authorised leave of absence, or other absence from paid service, that
results in less than a complete year of Salary , such calendar year shall be disregarded and the next preceding or
succeeding year or years shall be taken into account if it results in a higher average.
(f)    In determining the amount of a Deferred V ested Pension for the purposes of Section 4.04, the Pension shall be equal
to the greatest of the amounts determined under subsection (1), (2) or (3) below:
(1)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would
have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Age (subject to a maximum of 35 years) and
Highest A verage Monthly Salary as of September 30, 2003, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Member ’s actual years of Pensionable Service prior to October 1, 2003 (subject to a maximum of 35 years) and the
denominator of which is the years of Pensionable Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until
his Normal Retirement Age.
(2)    The aggregate of:
(i)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member
would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date and Highest A verage
Monthly Salary as of September 30, 2003, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Member ’s actual
years of Pensionable Service prior to October 1, 2003 and the denominator of which is the years of Pensionable
Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date; and
36
(ii)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member
would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date and the Highest A verage
Monthly Salary at the date the Member ceases to be in Service, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the Member ’s actual years of Pensionable Service after September 30, 2003 and the denominator of which is the
years of Pensionable Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal
Retirement Date.
(3)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would
have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date  and the Highest A verage Monthly
Salary at the date the Member ceases to be in Service, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Member ’s
actual years of Pensionable Service and the denominator of which is the years of Pensionable Service he would have
earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date.
For Members who became Members of the Plan before January 1, 1976, the Deferred V ested Pension shall be the
larger of 1½ percent of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary multiplied by the Member ’s number of years of
Pensionable Service at termination or the amount determined by the V ice President based on actuarial information
provided to the V ice President.
All deductions set out in (c) above that are applicable to a Member entitled to a Deferred V ested Pension shall be
calculated as of the time such Member ceases to be in Service and in accordance with methodology approved by the V ice
President.
(II)    Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension
    If a Member covered by Section 6.01 dies after the date he would have been entitled to retire early under Section 4.02, the Pre-
Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension, as applicable, shall be 50 percent of the Pension to
which the Member would have been entitled if he had retired on the day preceding his death (having elected a 50 Percent
Survivor Annuity calculated in accordance with Section 5.02(b)) and reduced in accordance with Section 4.02 if the Eligible
Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner commences the Pre-Retirement Souse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s
Pension, as applicable, prior to the date the Member would have attained age 62. If a Member covered by Section 6.01 dies
before the date he would have been entitled to retire early under Section 4.02, the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-
Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension, as applicable, shall be 50 percent of the Pension to which the Member would have been
entitled if he had attained the right to receive a 50 Percent Survivor Annuity calculated in accordance with Section 5.02(b)),
payable as of the first of the month following the later of death or the date the Member would have attained age 55, and reduced
in accordance with Section 4.04(c) if the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner commences the Pre-Retirement Souse’ s
Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension, as applicable, prior to the date the Member would have attained age 65.

ii
ARTICLE I – HIST ORY AND GENERAL INFORMA TION
    PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Corporation”) first established the PepsiCo International Retirement Plan ef fective as of September 1,
1980. The Plan at that time was comprised of the “PepsiCo International Retirement Plan T rust Indenture” and the “Plan Rules.”
The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety , effective September 2, 1982.
    The Plan was again amended and restated ef fective October 1, 2003, whereupon the Plan Rules became the “Plan A Rules”
(applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation’ s contributions to the trust established by the PepsiCo International Retirement
Plan T rust Indenture) and the “Plan B Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation as they arise) took ef fect.
    The Plan was further amended ef fective January 1, 2005, to provide that no person subject to taxation in the United States of
America may in any way have their right to a benefit from the Plan come into existence, increase or in any way be enhanced, but
instead will be determined as if they had left the Corporation and any Associated Company permanently before becoming subject
to U.S. taxation.
    Ef fective January 1, 2010, the Plan A Rules and Plan B Rules were amended and restated in their entirety to form one Plan
document. The amendment and restatement referred to in the prior sentence remains in ef fect, and it sets forth the terms of the
“DB Program.”
    Ef fective January 1, 201 1, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit
selected international employees for whom it has been determined to be appropriate ( i.e., employees on assignments outside of
their home countries for whom it is judged to be impractical to have them participate in their home country retirement plans, and
employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages). The terms of the DC
Program are set forth in this document, which is the governing legal document for the DC Program. Together , the DC Program
and the DB Program set forth the terms of a single Plan. The DC Program is also sometimes referred to in employee
communications as the PepsiCo International Pension Plan or “PIPP .”
    The DC Program was previously amended and restated, ef fective as of January 1, 2016. As part of that amendment and
restatement, the Corporation modified the DC Program to also benefit selected employees: (i) who are localized to a country
outside of their home country , (ii) were participating in a defined benefit or defined contribution retirement program sponsored
immediately prior to their localization and (iii) for whom no company-provided retirement program is available.
    The DC Program was again amended and restated ef fective as of January 1, 2019. As part of that amendment and restatement,
the Corporation modified the DC Program to recognize same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners for certain purposes for
participants actively employed or on authorized leave of absence on and after January 1, 2019.
1
    The DC Program is hereby amended and restated ef fective as of January 1, 2021.
    At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the United States Internal Revenue Code and Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that
executive’ s individual employer . With respect to his employer , the executive has the rights of an unsecured general creditor . The
Plan is also intended to be exempt from ERISA as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of
persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States.

Year to which an Interest Credit relates. The V ice President shall have the discretion to change from time to time the basis
for determining the Interest Rate as necessary to ensure that the Interest Rate is readily determinable and administrable,

Members as of the last day of each Plan Y ear. In addition, to the extent provided in Section 4.02, the DC Program shall
have a special V aluation Date prior to the end of a Plan Y ear for Active Members who have an Approved T ransfer (and
for certain Active Members who have a Status Change) as described in Section 4.02. In accordance with procedures that
may be adopted by the V ice President, any current V aluation Date may be changed (but in such case adjustments shall
apply in the operation of the DC Program as necessary to prevent duplicate or disproportionate benefits, as determined by
the V ice President). Values are determined as of the close of a V aluation Date or , if such date is not a business day , as of
the close of the preceding business day .

(b) Determining Periods of Y ears:  For the purposes of the DC Program, any period of 365 consecutive days (or of
366 consecutive days, if the period includes 29  February) shall be deemed to constitute a year , but not so that in the
calculation of a number of years any day is counted more than once. Where the amount of a benefit depends upon the
calculation of a number of years or months without expressly requiring that these should be complete years or months, a
proportionate amount ( i.e., a number of days) may be given for any part of a year or month which would not otherwise be
included in the calculation. Where this document makes reference to months or parts of a year , or to any other period of
time except a day , week or year the V ice President may authorize the period to be counted in days or complete calendar
months with each calendar month counted as 1/12th of a year .
(c) Compounds of the W ord “Here”:  The words “hereof” and “hereunder” and other similar compounds of the
word “here” shall mean and refer to the entire DC Program, not to any particular provision or section.     
(d) Examples:  Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item
or items, or there is a passage having a similar ef fect, such passages of the document shall be construed as if the phrase
“without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids
limitation on its breadth of application).
(e) Subdivisions of this Document:  This document is divided and subdivided using the following progression:
articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs and clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals.
Sections are designated by Arabic numerals containing a decimal point. Subsections are designated by lower -case letters
in parentheses. Paragraphs are designated by Arabic numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower -case
roman numerals in parentheses. Clauses are designated by upper -case letters in parentheses. Any reference in a section to
a subsection (with no accompanying section reference) shall be read as a reference to the subsection with the specified
designation contained in that same section. A similar rule shall apply with respect to paragraph references within a
subsection and subparagraph references within a paragraph.th

ARTICLE III – MEMBERSHIP
3.01    Eligibility for Membership.
    Every person who the V ice President determines is an Eligible Employee shall be eligible for Membership.
3.02    Admission to Membership.
    Every person who the V ice President determines is an Eligible Employee, and who is not during the relevant time a U.S.
Person, shall, following the approval of his Membership by the V ice President, be admitted to Membership ef fective as of his
Entry Date. For this purpose, the relevant time includes a suf ficient period before the Eligible Employee’ s Proposed Entry Date as
is necessary to avoid PIRP-DC Accounts being considered deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A of the United
States Internal Revenue Code. No Eligible Employee or any other person shall be admitted to Membership without the approval
of the V ice President.
3.03    Active and Inactive Membership.
    A Member shall be an Active Member during the period that he is – (a) employed as an Eligible Employee, (b) not a U.S.
Person, and (c) currently approved for status as an Active Member by the V ice President. A Member shall be an Inactive Member
during any period that he does not currently meet all of the requirements to be an Active Member .
10
ARTICLE IV – CONTRIBUTIONS
4.01    Contributions.
To the extent provided in subsections (a) and (b) below , the Employer shall allocate Pay Credits and Interest Credits to a
Member ’s PIRP-DC Account, each determined by the V ice President as follows –
(a) Pay Credit . To receive a Pay Credit for a Plan Y ear, an individual must be an Active Member during such year .
The amount of an Active Member ’s Pay Credit for a Plan Y ear shall be determined by multiplying the Active Member ’s
annualized Salary in ef fect as of that year ’s Valuation Date by the Active Member ’s applicable percentage, which shall be
one of the following: 5%, 8%, 10%, 12% or 18%. Effective for any Eligible Employee who becomes an Active Member
on or after January 1, 2021, the amount of the Active Member ’s Pay Credits shall be determined by the number of
“points” attributed to the Active Member in accordance with the following:
Points Amount of Pay Credit
Less than 35 5% of Eligible Pay
35-39 6% of Eligible Pay
40-44 7% of Eligible Pay
45-49 8% of Eligible Pay
50-54 9% of Eligible Pay
55-59 10% of Eligible Pay
60-64 11% of Eligible Pay
65 or more 12% of Eligible Pay
An Active Member ’s points shall be determined by the sum of the Active Member ’s age and years of Service, with each
expressed in whole years and days.
The V ice President shall specify the Active Member ’s applicable percentage as of the Active Member ’s Entry
Date. For each subsequent Plan Y ear that the individual is an Active Member , the V ice President may specify a new
applicable percentage that shall apply to the Active Member for such Plan Y ear. An Active Member shall cease receiving
Pay Credits during any Plan Y ear as necessary to ensure that the Active Member ’s Pay Credits do not exceed the Internal
Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) limit in ef fect for such Plan Y ear.
(b) Interest Credit . To receive an Interest Credit for a Plan Y ear, an individual must be either an Active Member or
Inactive Member during such year , and the individual must have had a balance in his PIRP-DC Account as of the prior
Plan Y ear’s Valuation Date. The amount of a Member ’s Interest Credit shall be determined by the
11
Vice President by multiplying the Interest Rate for the period since the last V aluation Date by the balance of the
Member ’s PIRP-DC Account as of such last V aluation Date.
A Member ’s Pay Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined by the V ice President as soon as administratively practicable after
each V aluation Date. If a Member has less than one full year of Active Membership since such last V aluation Date ( e.g., as may
apply in the Member ’s first and last year of Membership), the Member ’s Pay Credit as otherwise determined under subsection (a)
above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member ’s fractional year of Active Membership. If a Member has less
than one full year of Membership since such last V aluation Date, any Interest Credit as otherwise available and determined under
subsection (b) above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member ’s fractional year of Membership ( e.g., as may
apply in the Member ’s last year of Membership). A fractional year shall be computed by dividing the Member ’s days of
Membership or Active Membership (as applicable) during the Plan Y ear by the total number of days in such Plan Y ear. A period
of paid leave of absence during a Plan Y ear shall be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a
Member ’s Pay Credit for the Plan Y ear in accordance with the prior sentence. However , a period of unpaid leave of absence
during a Plan Y ear shall not be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a Member ’s Pay Credit
for the Plan Y ear in accordance with the prior sentence (and as a result, the Pay Credit for the Plan Y ear containing the unpaid
leave shall be prorated, or there shall be no Pay Credit, all as necessary to limit Pay Credits to the Member ’s period of Active
Membership during the Plan Y ear). In the event a prorated Pay Credit and Interest Credit relate to the Member ’s final year of
Membership, the Pay Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined as of the Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date (with
proration based upon the Member ’s fractional final year of Membership). The calculation of the Pay Credit and Interest Credit by
the V ice President shall be conclusive and binding on all Members (and their Dependants).
4.02    Offsets.
Notwithstanding Section 4.01, the Corporation may reduce the amount of any payment or benefit that is or would become
payable to or on behalf of a Member by the amount of any obligation of the Member to the Corporation or by the amount of –
(a) Any material benefits accrued by the Member under a retirement plan sponsored by the Corporation or by any
country , state, province or other political subdivision or locality , to the extent the V ice President determines that the
benefit amount under such retirement plan is for Service or Salary that is taken into account in providing Pay Credits
under the DC Program, and
(b) Any termination indemnity or other payment to the Member by the Employer or PepsiCo Or ganization related
to the Member ’s termination of employment, to the extent the V ice President determines that the payment is reasonably
related to Service that is taken into account in providing Pay Credits under the DC Program.
12
Consistent with the foregoing, appropriate reductions may be made in the Pay Credits and Interest Credits that otherwise would
be provided to the Member under Sections 4.01 and 4.02, the balance in the Member ’s PIRP-DC Account under Article V , or the
Member ’s distributions under Article VI. The determination of whether a benefit is material and all other aspects of the
application of this Section 4.02 is solely in the independent discretion of the V ice President.
13
ARTICLE V – MEMBER ACCOUNTS
5.01    Accounting for Members’ Inter ests.
Pay Credits and Interest Credits shall be credited to a Member ’s PIRP-DC Account as of the V aluation Date to which such
credits relate (or , in the case of Pay Credits and Interest Credits that relate to the Member ’s final year of Membership, as of the
Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date) or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter . A Member ’s PIRP-DC Account is a
bookkeeping device to track the notional value of the Member ’s Pay Credits and Interest Credits (and his Employer ’s liability for
such credits). No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with any PIRP-DC Account, and no PIRP-DC Account
shall be funded, insured or otherwise secured.
5.02    Vesting.
Subject to Sections 4.02 and 9.14, a Member shall be fully vested in, and have a nonforfeitable right to, his PIRP-DC
Account upon completing 3 years of Service, or if earlier , upon the death or disability of the Member while employed by the
Employer or PepsiCo Or ganization. The determination of whether a Member has become disabled for this purpose shall be made
by the V ice President in accordance with such standards as the V ice President deems to be appropriate as of the time in question.
5.03    Special V esting for Appr oved T ransfers and Status Changes.
(a) Automatic Special V esting for Approved T ransfers.  Notwithstanding Section 5.02 above, in the case of an
Active Member who will have an Approved T ransfer during a Plan Y ear, the Active Member shall automatically have
special vesting apply as of the last business day before the earlier of – (a) the Active Member ’s Approved T ransfer , or (b)
the day the Active Member would become a U.S. Person in connection with the Approved T ransfer .
(b) Special V esting for Status Changes . Also notwithstanding Section 5.02 above, in the case of an Active Member
who will have a Status Change, the Active Member may request that the V ice President apply special vesting to him as of
the last business day before the Active Member ’s Status Change. In order for special vesting related to a Status Change to
be valid and ef fective under the DC Program, the Active Member ’s request and the V ice President’ s approval of the
request must both be completely final and in place prior to the date that the special vesting applies.
Subject to the next sentence, the ef fect of special vesting applying to a Member in accordance with either subsection (a) or (b)
above is that the Member will become vested, to the same extent as could apply under Section 5.02 if the Member vested under
that Section, as of the date that the special vesting applies. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 5.03, rights
under this Section 5.03 are subject to the overriding requirement that allocations, benefits and
14
other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and this
Section 5.03 shall not apply to the extent inconsistent with this requirement.
15
ARTICLE VI – DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS
6.01    Distribution Rules Generally .
A Member ’s PIRP-DC Account shall be distributed based upon first to occur of the Member ’s termination of employment

6.02    Distributions Upon T ermination of Employment.
If a Member ’s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his termination of employment with the PepsiCo

Member is disabled and the date on which such Member ’s termination of employment is considered to occur shall be made by the
Vice President.
6.03    Distributions Upon Death.
If a Member ’s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his death, such distribution shall be made in a single
lump sum payment on the first day of the month that immediately follows the Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date. Amounts

is in ef fect at the time of the Member ’s death (as determined by the V ice President), or if all persons designated as Dependants
have predeceased the Member , then the payments to be made pursuant to this Section shall be distributed to the Member ’s
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as applicable, or , if the Member does not have an Eligible Spouse or an Eligible
Domestic Partner at the time of his death, to his estate.
6.04    Valuation.
In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article, the Member ’s PIRP-DC Account shall

Valuation Date.
6.05    Designation of Dependant.
A Member shall designate one or more Dependants who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death. A Member
shall have the right to change or revoke his Dependant designation at any time prior to the ef fective date of such election. If the
Member is married at the time he or she designates a Dependant(s), any designation under this section of a Dependant(s) who is
not the Member ’s Eligible Spouse shall require the written consent of the Member ’s Eligible Spouse. A revocation of a
Dependant(s) does not require consent by the
16
Member ’s Eligible Spouse. The designation of any Dependant(s), and any change or revocation thereof, and any written consent
of a Member ’s Eligible Spouse required by this Section shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the V ice President,

ARTICLE VII – ADMINISTRA TION
7.01    Authority to Administer Plan.
(a) Administration by the V ice President:  The Plan shall be administered by the V ice President, who shall have the
authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as he deems appropriate. All actions by the V ice President
hereunder may be taken in his sole discretion, and all interpretations, determinations and regulations made or issued by
the V ice President shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned.
(b) Authority to Delegate:  The V ice President may delegate any of his responsibilities under the Plan to other
persons or entities, or designate or employ other persons to carry out any of his duties, responsibilities or other functions
under the Plan. Any reference in the Plan to an action by the V ice President shall, to the extent applicable, refer to such
action by the V ice President’ s delegate or other designated person.
7.02    Facility of Payment.
Whenever , in the opinion of the V ice President, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit hereunder is under a
legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the V ice President may direct that
payments from the Plan be made to such person’ s legal representative for his benefit, or that the payment be applied for the
benefit of such person in such manner as the V ice President considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall be a complete dischar ge of any liability for the making of such payment under the provisions of
the Plan.
7.03    Claims Pr ocedur e.
    The V ice President shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions
of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits, and his decisions on such matters are final and conclusive.
As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the V ice President decides in his discretion that the person claiming such
benefits is entitled to them. This discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case where the extent of this
discretion is in question, the V ice President is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary
authority shall be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the abuse of
discretion standard). If, pursuant to this discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Member
or Dependant (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the V ice President, or a party designated by the V ice President, will
provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the V ice President, a comprehensible written
notice setting forth:
18
(a) The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
(b) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(c) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the
claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
(d) A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process).
If the V ice President determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim he may
extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the V ice President will notify the claimant before the end of the
initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President
expects to make the final decision. Upon review , the V ice President shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim,
including the opportunity to submit to the V ice President comments, document, records and other information relevant to the
claim and the V ice President’ s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of
whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after
receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this
occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special
circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President expects to make the final decision. The final
decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the
decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to
receive, upon request and free of char ge, copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his claim for
benefits.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis
of the record before the V ice President at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on
the claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this section.
7.04    Limitations on Actions.
Any claim filed under Article VII and any action filed in any court or other tribunal by or on behalf of a former or current
Employee, Member , Dependant or any other individual, person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful
denial of Plan benefits must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of
this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than
earlier of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action; (ii)
the date identified to the Petitioner by the V ice President on which payment shall be made; or (ii) when he has actual or
19
constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this
two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of action.
Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals process described above shall have no ef fect on this
two-year time frame.
7.05    Restriction of V enue.

located nearest the Corporation’ s headquarters.
7.06    Effect of Specific Refer ences.
Specific references in the Plan to the V ice President’ s discretion shall create no inference that the V ice President’ s
discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.
20
ARTICLE VIII – AMENDMENT AND TERMINA TION
8.01    Continuation of the Plan.
While the Corporation intends to continue the Plan indefinitely , it assumes no contractual obligation as to its continuance.
The Corporation hereby reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any time
provided, however , that no such amendment or termination shall reduce the balance (determined as of the date of such
amendment or termination) in the Plan account maintained for the benefit of a Member or his Dependant, except to the extent the
Member becomes entitled to an amount under another plan or practice maintained by an Employer . Specific forms (including
times) of payment are not protected under the preceding sentence.
8.02    Amendment.
The Corporation may , in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to this Plan from time to time, with or
without retroactive ef fect, subject to Section 8.01. An Employer (other than the Corporation) shall not have the right to amend the
Plan.
8.03    Termination.
The Corporation may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as to the participation of one or more Employers.
If the Plan is terminated with respect to fewer than all of the Employers, the Plan shall continue in ef fect for the benefit of the
employees of the remaining Employers.
21
ARTICLE IX – MISCELLANEOUS
9.01    Unfunded Plan.
The Employers’ obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Employer payable
when due out of the Employer ’s general funds. To the extent a Member or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits
under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Employer .
9.02    Costs of the Plan.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Corporation, all costs, char ges and expenses of or incidental to the administration and
management of the Plan shall be the costs, char ges and expenses of the Employers and shall be paid by each Employer based on
the proportion of Members who are employed by such Employer as compared to the total number of Members at the time the cost
or expense is incurred.
9.03    Temporary Absence of Member .
If a Member is absent from duty by reason other than death, dischar ge, retirement or quitting ( e.g., sickness, accident,
layof f, vacation), he shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that is 12 months after the date on which he is
absent, unless the V ice President determines otherwise. If the Member ’s absence from duty is by reason of his service as a full-
time member of the armed forces of any country or of any or ganization engaged in national service of any such country , he shall
not be deemed to have terminated employment so long as he is regarded by the Employer as remaining in employment or until he
shall resign permanently from employment, whichever shall first occur .
9.04    Taxes, Etc.
In the event any tax or assessment or other duty is determined by the V ice President to be owing in respect of any benefit
payable from the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to withhold an amount not exceeding the amount of any such tax or assessment
or other duty from the benefit payable and shall apply the same in satisfaction of said tax or assessment or other duty .
9.05    Nonguarantee of Employment.
Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any of its employees, or as
a right of any such employee to continue in the employment of the Employer , or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to
dischar ge any of its employees, with or without cause.
22
9.06    No Right to Benefits.
No person, whether or not being a Member , shall have any claim, right or interest under the Plan except as provided by
the terms of the Plan. In the event of a Member ’s termination of employment by an Employer , the resulting cessation of his
Membership shall not be grounds for any damages or any increase in damages in any action brought against the Employer or any
member of the PepsiCo Or ganization with respect to such termination.
9.07    Charges on Benefits and Recovery of Excess Payments.
All benefits in respect of a Member under the Plan shall stand char ged with and be subject to deductions therefrom of all
sums in respect of losses to a member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer or otherwise caused by misdemeanor of the
Member and on production by the member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer of proof satisfactory to the V ice President
that any such loss ought to be made good by a Member . The relevant amount shall be deductible from the Member ’s benefits and
be payable to the Employer or member of the PepsiCo Or ganization whose receipt shall be a valid dischar ge for the same.
Payments to, for or in connection with a Member that are made (as of a point in time and to any person or entity) may not
exceed the exact amount of payments that are due as of such time and to such person, as provided by the terms of the Plan that
specify the amounts that are payable, the time as of which they are payable, and the person to whom they are payable.
Accordingly , any such excess payment or any other overpayment, premature payment or misdirected payment (one or more of
which are hereafter referred to as an “Excess Payment”) may not be retained by the party receiving it, but must be restored
promptly to the Plan. In exchange for Member or beneficiary status hereunder (or for having any other direct or indirect right or
claim of right from the Plan, or solely as a result of having received an Excess Payment), any party receiving an Excess Payment
grants to the Plan the following nonexclusive rights –
(1)    A constructive trust and first priority equitable lien on any payment that is received directly or
indirectly from the Plan and that is, in whole or part, an Excess Payment (such trust and lien shall be equal to the
amount of the Excess Payment increased by appropriate interest) or upon the proceeds or substitutes for such
payment, and any transfer shall be subject to such constructive trust and equitable lien (including a transfer to a
person, trust fund or entity).
(2)    The right to of fset (as necessary to recover the Excess Payment with appropriate interest)
other payments that are properly payable by the Plan to the recipient of the Excess Payment; however , reliance on
this right is in the discretion of the V ice President, and the existence of an opportunity to apply it shall not
diminish the Plan’ s rights under paragraph (1) above.
(3)    The right to bring any equitable or legal action or proceeding with respect to the enforcement
of any rights in this Section in any court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect, and following receipt of
an
23
Excess Payment the Member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving any and all rights that may
correspond to such party’ s present or future residence.
Any party receiving an Excess Payment shall promptly take all actions requested by the V ice President that are in
furtherance of the Plan’ s recovery of the Excess Payment with appropriate interest. In all cases, this subsection shall
maximize the rights of the Plan to recover improper payments and shall not restrict the rights of the Plan in any way ,
including with respect to any improper payment that is not addressed above.
9.08    Pr ohibited Misconduct.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the V ice President determines that a
Member has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of his termination of
employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization, the Member shall forfeit all Pay Credits and Interest Credits (whether paid
previously , being paid currently or payable in the future), and his PIRP-DC Account shall be adjusted to reflect such
forfeiture and previously paid Pay Credits and Interest Credits shall be recovered. As a condition to Membership in this
Plan, each Member agrees to this and each Member agrees to repay PepsiCo the amounts it seeks to recover under this
Section 9.08.
(b) Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly , by a Member shall constitute Prohibited
Misconduct:
(1) The Member accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility , or acquiring any
ownership interest, which involves the Member ’s “Participation” (as defined below) in a business entity that
markets, sells, distributes or produces “Covered Products” (as defined below), unless such business entity makes
retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
(2) The Member , directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Member ’s
recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Or ganization employee to leave the
PepsiCo Or ganization’ s employment or to accept any position with any other entity .
(3) The Member using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo
Organization other than as necessary in his position with the PepsiCo Or ganization. Such confidential information
shall include all non-public information the Member acquired as a result of his positions with the PepsiCo
Organization. Examples of such confidential information include non-public information about the PepsiCo
Organization’ s customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition tar gets; its business operations and
structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes,
24
machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.
(4) The Member engaging in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the PepsiCo Or ganization’ s best
interests, including violating the Corporation’ s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of
the Corporation or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his employment with the
PepsiCo Or ganization, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
(5) The Member engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Member from
communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the Corporation,
participating in government investigations, and/or receiving any applicable award for providing information to
government authorities. The Corporation nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any
information appropriately protected by the privilege. Further , pursuant to the Defend T rade Secrets Act, an individual
shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret
that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government of ficial, either directly or indirectly , or to an
attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a
complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who
files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the
attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any
document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order .
For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director , officer,
employee, consultant or contractor with respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or
suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or testimonial on behalf of such a business
entity or one or more products it produces. For purposes of this subsection, “Covered Products” shall mean any product
that falls into one or more of the following categories, so long as the PepsiCo Or ganization is producing, marketing,
selling or licensing such product anywhere in the world – beverages, including without limitation carbonated soft drinks,
tea, water , juice drinks, sports drinks, cof fee drinks, ener gy drinks, and value-added dairy drinks; juices and juice
products; dairy products; snacks, including salty snacks, sweet snacks meat snacks, granola and cereal bars, and cookies;
hot cereals; pancake mixes; value-added rice products; pancake syrups; value-added pasta products; ready-to-eat cereals;
dry pasta products; or any product or service that the Member had reason to know was under development by the PepsiCo
Organization during the Member ’s employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
25
9.09    Notices.
Any notice which under the Plan is required to be given to or served upon the Plan shall be deemed to be suf ficiently
given to or served upon the Plan if it is in writing and delivered to the V ice President. In any case where under the Plan any
notice shall be required to be given to Members, it shall be suf ficient if such notice is delivered to the Member ’s last known
address on file in the records of the Employer or delivered to the Member pursuant to any other method ( e.g., electronically) that
the V ice President determines is reasonably available to the Member .
9.10    Plan Documentation.
Every Member shall on demand be entitled to a copy of the Plan.
9.11    Curr ency of Payment.
Payment of benefits under the Plan shall be made in United States dollars, or other "eligible currency ," as approved by the
Vice President. The amount otherwise payable in United States dollars would be converted to the selected currency using the
exchange rate, based on the methodology approved by the V ice President from time to time.
9.12    Governing Law .
The Plan shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New Y ork.
9.13    Exemption fr om ERISA.
The Plan is intended to be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”),
as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident
aliens of the United States. In order to preserve this exemption from ERISA, Active Membership in the Plan shall be limited to
individuals who are nonresident aliens of the United States and whose assigned work locations are outside the United States, and
it is intended that all permanent records and documentation relating to the administration of the Plan shall be kept at a location
that is outside of the United States.
9.14    Exemption fr om Section 409A.
In order to permit this Plan to be completely exempt from United States Internal Revenue Code section 409A (“Section
409A”), this Plan shall be subject to the special operating rules and limitations in this Section 9.14, ef fective for any period to
which Section 409A applies. It is the intent of the Plan that no Member who is a U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit
from the Plan vest, increase or in any way be enhanced (collectively , a “Benefit Enhancement”) as a result of their compensation
or service while a U.S. Person. However , Interest Credits may be
26
provided on the PIRP-DC Account of a Member who is a U.S. Person, but only to the extent the balance in the PIRP-DC Account
is derived from Pay Credits that relate to Service completed while the Member was not a U.S. Person (and Interest Credits on
such Pay Credits). Accordingly , no Member shall become entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a calendar year until
it is determined, following the close of such year , that the Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such year .
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the calendar year a Member ’s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence, the
Vice President may authorize a Benefit Enhancement for the calendar year of benefit commencement to the extent the V ice
President determines satisfactorily that the Member will not be a U.S. Person for such year . In other cases, the Member ’s benefit
will commence under this Plan without any Benefit Enhancement related to the calendar year of commencement, and appropriate
adjustments will be made to the Member ’s benefit in the following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person
in such calendar year of commencement. This Section 9.14 shall at all times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the
overriding requirement that allocations, benefits and rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A, and
the V ice President shall have such unrestricted authority as is necessary to ensure that it is applied in accordance with this
requirement.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Article I.
Foreword
The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PepsiCo for the
benefit of salaried employees of the PepsiCo Organization who participate in the PepsiCo Salaried Employees
Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the
Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP
provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula.
1989 Document . The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety ef fective as of January 1, 1989.
The provisions of the Plan in ef fect prior to January 1, 1989 govern the rights and benefits of employees whose
Credited Service ended before that date (and as necessary , before the ef fective date of any provision with a dif ferent
pre-1989 ef fective date).
2005 Document . This document (the “Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document”) was first ef fective as of
January 1, 2005 (the “Ef fective Date”) and was restated to reflect amendments through December 31, 2008. It
generally retained without modification the provisions of the 1989 restatement. However , it was clarified to reflect that
it set forth the terms of the Plan applicable to benefits that were grandfathered under Section 409A, i.e., generally ,
benefits that were both earned and vested on or before December 31, 2004 (the “Pre-409A Program”).
2016 Restatement . The previous restatement of the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document was ef fective as
of April 1, 2016. There were no material modifications made to the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document as a result of
the 2016 restatement. The Pre-409A PepsiCo
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
PEP Document continues generally to retain without modification the provisions of the 1989 restatement.
The 2016 restatement reflected amendments through April 1, 2016, including amendments to reflect the
merger into this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PBG PEP”), ef fective at the end of the day on
December 31, 2011. The PBG PEP document that was in ef fect on October 3, 2004 as amended through January 1,
2011 (“Pre-409A PBG PEP Document”) and as subsequently amended from time to time is attached hereto as
Appendix Article PBG Pre-409A; it continues to govern PBG PEP benefits that were grandfathered under Section
409A and that were subject to the Pre-409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger , except for certain
administrative provisions now governed by the main portion of the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document as is explained
in Appendix Article PBG Pre-409A. There has been no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are
subject to Section 409A under either the PepsiCo PEP Program or the PBG PEP Program that would constitute a
material modification within the meaning of T reas. Reg.§ 1.409A-6(a)(4) as a result of the merger or the revisions to
the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document and Pre-409A PBG PEP document.
2021 Restatement . This restatement reflects amendments through January 1, 2021, including
provisions that (i) reflect updates to the Salaried Plan’ s actuarial factors that became ef fective January 1, 2019, and
(ii) provide related nonqualified enhancements with respect to Participants’ 409A and Pre-409A accruals.
409A Program . All benefits under the Plan that are earned or vested after January 1, 1989 shall be
governed by the Plan Document for the Section 409A Program (the “409A Program”). Together , this document (the
Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document) and the Plan Document for the Section 409A Program describe the terms of a
single plan.
- 2 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Preservation of Pre-409A Program Within PEP Plan . This document (the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP
Document) has been modified to clarify (without any material modification) the integration of the Pre-409A Program
with the 409A Program. However , amounts subject to the terms of this Pre-409A Program and amounts subject to the
terms of the 409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A
Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A
Program amounts are intended to be suf ficient to permit the Pre-409A Program to remain exempt from Section 409A
as a program of grandfathered benefits.

Article II.
Definitions and Construction
2.1    Definitions : This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases. Where the following
words and phrases, in boldface and underlined, appear in this Plan with initial capitals they shall have the meaning
set forth below , unless a dif ferent meaning is plainly required by the context.
Accrued Benefit : The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance
with Article V , based on the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Credited Service at the date
of determination.
Actuarial Equivalent : Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to
the Plan with respect to a specific benefit determination, a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of
the factors set forth below . The application of the following assumptions to the computation of benefits payable
under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner . In the event the Plan is amended to provide
new rights, features or benefits, the following actuarial factors shall not apply to these new elements unless
specifically adopted by the amendment.
(1) Annuities and Inflation Protection :
(i)     Annuity Starting Dates After December 31, 2018 : To determine the amount of
a Pension payable as of an Annuity Starting Date after December 31, 2018 (A) in the form of a Qualified
Joint and Survivor Annuity or other form of survivor annuity , (B) as an annuity with inflation protection, or
(C) as a period certain and life annuity or other death benefit annuity , the Plan Administrator shall
specify the factors that are to be used. Effective January 1,
- 4 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
2019, the factors specified by the Plan Administrator are set forth in Schedule 1 below . Subsequently ,
the Plan Administrator may specify new factors for these and other forms of payment, in its sole and
absolute discretion, by a resolution adopted by the Plan Administrator . A Participant’ s benefit under the
Pre-409A Program shall be determined under the actuarial factors specified and in ef fect as of the
Annuity Starting Date of the Participant’ s benefit. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly intended
and binding upon Participants that any actuarial factors for forms of payment specified by the Plan
Administrator may be applied retroactively to previously accrued benefits, and without regard to the
factors that previously applied for such purpose. In particular , in adjusting benefits under the Plan using
the factors in Schedule 1 (below), the right to a benefit that is not less than would have applied under
the prior basis for this adjustment shall not apply (even when, for example, it would apply under the
Salaried Plan with respect to the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors). For this purpose, the phrase “2019
Salaried Plan Factors” refers to the new factors that appear in the Salaried Plan’ s definition of “Actuarial

*As this term is defined in the Salaried Plan’ s definition of “Actuarial Equivalent”
(ii)    Annuity Starting Dates Before January 1, 2019 : To determine the amount of a
Pension payable as of an Annuity Starting Date before January 1, 2019, and in the form of a Qualified
Joint and Survivor Annuity or other form of survivor annuity , or as an annuity with inflation protection,
the factors applicable as of such time for such purposes under the Salaried Plan shall apply . However ,
in determining a Pre-409A Pension payable as of an Annuity Starting Date before January 1, 2019, no
change in such factors occurring on or after the Ef fective Date in the basis for determining the amount
of an annuity form of payment from that in ef fect as of December 31, 2004 shall be taken into account to
the extent it would result in a larger annuity (but this sentence shall not apply for purposes of Section
5.1(b)(3), relating to the “Limit on the Pre-409A Pension Benefit”).
(2) Lump Sums : To determine the lump sum value of a Pension, or a Pre-
Retirement Spouse’ s Pension under Section 4.6, the factors applicable for such purposes under the
Salaried Plan shall apply , except that when the term “PBGC Rate” is used in the Salaried Plan in this
context it shall mean “PBGC Rate” as defined in this Plan. However , in determining a Pre-409A
- 6 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Pension, no amendment, which is ef fective on or after the Ef fective Date, to the Salaried Plan’ s
provisions for determining lump sums from those in ef fect as of December 31, 2004 shall be taken into
account to the extent that doing so is expected to result in a larger lump sum (or in the case of a
Salaried Plan amendment that becomes ef fective on or after January 1, 2015, a dif ferent lump sum,
unless this Pre-409A Program document is amended to expressly apply the Salaried Plan amendment
in determining a Pre-409A Pension), but this sentence shall not apply for purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3),
relating to the “Limit on the Pre-409A Pension Benefit.” For example, therefore, the Salaried Plan
amendment that adopted Pension Protection Act factors for lump sums ef fective January 1, 2008 is
generally taken into account under the Pre-409A Program, but the Salaried Plan amendment that
changed the “lookback period” and “stability period” for lump sums ef fective January 1, 2015 is not
taken account under the Pre-409A Program, except for purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3).
(3) Other Cases : To determine the adjustment to be made in the Pension payable
to or on behalf of a Participant in other cases (including to reduce a V ested Pension for early
commencement), the factors are those applicable for such purpose under the Salaried Plan. However ,
in determining a Pre-409A Pension, no change occurring on or after the Ef fective Date in such factors
from those in ef fect as of December 31, 2004 shall be taken into account to the extent that it would
result in a larger pension (but this sentence shall not apply for purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3), relating to
the “Limit on the Pre-409A Pension Benefit”).

as of that date is too great to make the distribution, but the lump sum value is not too great as of his
Annuity Starting Date under the terms of this Pre-409A
- 24 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Program, such Annuity Starting Date shall be the applicable commencement date); and
(2)     Beginning as of December 1, 2012, the first of the month following the
Participant’ s termination of employment date (however , if the lump sum value as of that date is too great
to make the distribution, but the lump sum value is not too great as of his Annuity Starting Date under
the terms of this Pre-409A Program, such Annuity Starting Date shall be the applicable commencement
date).
(b)    Distribution of Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pre-409A Pension Benefit : If on the Eligible
Spouse’ s applicable benefit commencement date, the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value of the PEP Pre-
Retirement Spouse’ s Pre-409A Pension to be paid is equal to or less than the Cashout Limit, the Plan
Administrator shall distribute to the Eligible Spouse such lump sum value of the PEP Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s
Pre-409A Pension. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for commencement dates prior to December 1,
2012, an Eligible Spouse shall be cashed out under this subsection if the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value
of the Eligible Spouse’ s PEP Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension is equal to or less than $15,000 ($10,000 in
the case of a Pre-2005 Participant). Such lump sum (or portion thereof) representing the Eligible Spouse’ s

Pension, the first of the month following the Participant’ s death (however , if the lump sum value as of
that date is too great to make the distribution, but the lump sum value is not too great as of the date that

such benefit commencement date shall be the applicable commencement date); and
(2)     Beginning as of December 1, 2012, the first of the month following the
Participant’ s death (however , if the lump sum value as of that date is too great to make the distribution,
but the lump sum value is not too great as of the date that would be the Eligible Spouse’ s benefit
commencement date under the terms of this Pre-409A Program, such benefit commencement date
shall be the applicable commencement date).
(c)    Special Cashout of Pre-409A V ested Pensions : Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the
Plan Administrator shall have discretion under this subsection to cash out a Pre-409A V ested Pension in a
single lump sum prior to the date that would apply under subsection (a).
(1)    The Plan Administrator shall have discretion under this subsection to cash out
in a single lump sum any Pre-409A V ested Pension that, as of December 1, 2012 – (i) has not
otherwise had its Annuity Starting Date occur , (ii) has an Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value that is
equal to or less than the Cashout Limit as of such date, and (iii) is practicable to calculate and
- 26 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
distribute (as determined pursuant to the exercise of the Plan Administrator ’s discretion), with such
cashout being made on December 1, 2012.
(2)    The Plan Administrator shall also have discretion under this subsection to
cash out in a single lump sum any Pre-409A V ested Pension that, as of the first day of any month in
2013 or 2014 specified by the Plan Administrator pursuant to the exercise of its discretion – (i) has not
otherwise had its Annuity Starting Date occur , (ii) has an Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value that is
equal to or less than the Cashout Limit as of such date, and (iii) is practicable to calculate and distribute
(as determined pursuant to the exercise of the Plan Administrator ’s discretion), with such cashout being
made on the first day of the month specified.
Not later than November 30, the Plan Administrator shall memorialize in writing the exercise of its discretion
under this subsection to select V ested Pensions for cashout on December 1, 2012, through the creation of a
written list (in either hard copy or electronic form) of Participants with Pre-409A V ested Pensions who will be
cashed out. In addition, not later than the day before the date specified pursuant to paragraph (2) above, the
Plan Administrator shall memorialize in writing the exercise of its discretion under this subsection to select
Vested Pensions for cashout on the specified date, through the creation of a written list (in either hard copy or
electronic form) of Participants with Pre-409A V ested Pensions who will be cashed out.
Any lump sum distributed under this section shall be in lieu of the Pension that otherwise would be distributable to the
Participant or Eligible Spouse hereunder . To the extent necessary to preserve the grandfathered status of Pre-409A
Pensions, the cashout provisions described in
- 27 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
subsections (a) through (c) above are intended to operate in conformance with the rules for “limited cashout” features
within the meaning of T reasury Regulation sections 1.409A-3(j)(4)(v) and 1.409A-6(a)(4)(i)(E), and they shall be
interpreted and applied consistently with this regulation. No Participant or Eligible Spouse shall be given a direct or
indirect election with respect to whether the Participant’ s Vested Pension or the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension will
be cashed out under this section.
4.10    Reemployment of Certain Participants : In the case of a current or former Participant who is
reemployed and is eligible to reparticipate in the Salaried Plan after his Annuity Starting Date, payment of his Pre-
409A Pension will be suspended if payment of his Salaried Plan pension is suspended (or if payment would have
been suspended pursuant to such provisions if (i) it were already in pay status, and (ii) changes in the Salaried Plan
terms that occur after December 31, 2004 were disregarded). Thereafter , his Pre-409A Pension shall recommence at
the time determined under Section 6.1 (even if the suspension of his Salaried Plan pension ceases earlier).

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Article V .
Amount of Retirement Pension
When a Pension becomes payable to or on behalf of a Post-2004 Participant under this Plan, the
amount of such Pre-409A Pension shall be determined under Section 5.1 or 5.3 (whichever is applicable), subject to
any adjustments required under Sections 4.6(b), 5.4 and 5.5. In the case of a Pre-2005 Participant, the amount of
such Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension (or a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pre-409A Pension payable on his behalf) shall
be determined as provided in Article B of the Appendix.
5.1    Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension
(a) Calculating the Pre-409A Pension:  In the case of a Post-2004 Participant, such Participant’ s
Pre-409A Pension shall be calculated as follows (on the basis specified in subsection (b) below and using the
definitions appearing in subsection (c) below):
(1)     His T otal Pension, reduced by
(2)     His Salaried Plan Pension.
(b) Basis for Determining : The Pre-409A Pension Benefit amount in subsection (a) above shall
be the greater of the amount determined on the basis set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) below , but never more
than the limitation specified in paragraph (3) below:
(1)    Present V alue Method : The Pre-409A Pension Benefit amount under this
paragraph shall be determined initially as a present value of the Participant’ s benefit under subsection
(a) as of December 31, 2004 (determined as if the Participant voluntarily terminated on that date without
- 29 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
cause, received a payment on the earliest possible commencement date (“Earliest Date”) thereafter ,
and such payment was in the form with the maximum value available to the Participant in connection
with a termination at such time), using the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum factors in ef fect on such date
(“2004 Lump Sum Factors”) to determine the present value. Such present value amount shall then be
increased, if the Participant had not yet attained the Participant’ s Earliest Date as of December 31,
2004, for both interest and survivorship through such Earliest Date, using the 2004 Lump Sum Factors.
(2)     Accrued Benefit Method : The Pre-409A Pension Benefit amount under this
paragraph shall be based on the Participant’ s Accrued Benefit as of December 31, 2004, but with such
Accrued Benefit amount reduced for early commencement (where applicable based on the Participant’ s
actual Annuity Starting Date for his Pre-409A Pension), based upon the reduction factors for early
commencement applicable to the Participant’ s status as eligible for a retirement benefit (under Section
4.2) or a vested benefit (under Section 4.3), whichever applies.
(3)    Limit on the Pre-409A Pension Benefit : Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or (2)
above, a Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension Benefit amount shall never exceed the Participant’ s Total
Pension reduced by his Salaried Plan Pension, with each calculated as of the actual Annuity Starting
Date of Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension. For purposes of this paragraph (3), the provisions of Article IV
that freeze the Participant’ s status as of December 31, 2004 (or consider only the status on such date),
and the provisions of this
- 30 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
document that bar taking into account Plan changes that are ef fective after December 31, 2004 shall
not be taken into account.
(c) Definitions : The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1) A Participant’ s “Total Pension” means the greater of:
(i) The amount of the Participant’ s pension determined under the terms of the
Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the
Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial
adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of Part B of the Salaried Plan (relating to benefits that are deferred
beyond the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date); or
(ii) The amount (if any) of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under Section 5.2.
For purposes of subsection (b)(1) and (2), the determination in clause (i) and (ii) above shall be made
(except, in the case of subsection (b)(2), with respect to early commencement reductions, which shall be
made as of the Annuity Starting Date) as of December 31, 2004, and (except to the extent the provisions
of the Plan specifically authorize taking into account subsequent changes) shall be made on the basis of
the terms of the Salaried Plan without taking into account changes after December 31, 2004. As
necessary to ensure the Participant’ s receipt of a “greater of” benefit, the foregoing comparison between
clause (i) and clause (ii) shall be made by reflecting, as applicable, the relative value of forms of
payment.
- 31 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(2) A Participant’ s “Salaried Plan Pension” means the amount of the Participant’ s
pension determined under the terms of the Salaried Plan. For purposes of subsection (b)(1) and (2), the
determination of a Participant’ s Salaried Plan Pension shall be made (except, in the case of subsection
(b)(2), with respect to early commencement reductions, which shall be made as of the Annuity Starting
Date) as of December 31, 2004, and (except to the extent the provisions of the Plan specifically
authorize taking into account subsequent changes) shall be made on the basis of the terms of the
Salaried Plan without taking into account changes after December 31, 2004.
5.2    PEP Guarantee : A Post-2004 Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be
entitled to a PEP Guarantee benefit determined under subsection (b) below . In the case of Participants who are not
eligible under subsection (a), the PEP Guarantee shall not apply .
(a) Eligibility : A Participant shall be covered by this section if the Participant has 1988
pensionable earnings from an Employer of at least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable
earnings” means the Participant’ s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year , within the meaning of the Salaried
Plan as in ef fect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include remuneration from an entity
attributable to any period when that entity was not an Employer .
(b) PEP Guarantee Formula : The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee shall be determined
under the applicable formula in paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).
(1) Formulas : The amount of a Participant’ s Pension under this paragraph shall be
determined in accordance with subparagraph (i)
- 32 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
below . However , if the Participant was actively employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification
eligible for the Salaried Plan prior to July 1, 1975, the amount of his Pension under this paragraph shall
be the greater of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (i) and (ii), provided that subparagraph
(ii)(B) shall not apply in determining the amount of a V ested Pension.
(i) Formula A : The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be:
(A) 3 percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for the
first 10 years of Credited Service, plus
(B) 1 percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for each
year of Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less
(C) 1-2/3 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount
multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.
In determining the amount of a V ested Pension under this Formula A, the Pension shall first be
calculated on the basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he
remained in the employ of the Employer until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest
Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at his Severance from Service
Date, and then shall be reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Participant’ s actual
- 33 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
years of Credited Service on his Severance from Service Date (or December 31, 2004, if earlier)
and the denominator of which is the years of Credited Service he would have earned had he
remained in the employ of an Employer until his Normal Retirement Age.
(ii)    Formula B : The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be the greater
of (A) or (B) below:
(A)    1-1/2 percent of Highest A verage Monthly Earnings times the number
of years of Credited Service, less 50 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount,
or
(B)    3 percent of Highest A verage Monthly Earnings times the number of
years of Credited Service up to 15 years, less 50 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social
Security Amount.
In determining the amount of a Disability Pension under Formula A or B above, the Pension shall be
calculated on the basis of the Participant’ s Credited Service (determined in accordance with
Section 3.3(d)(3) of the Salaried Plan, as in ef fect on December 31, 2004), and his Highest A verage
Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at the date of disability (or as of such earlier date
as may apply under Section 5.1(b)).
(2) Calculation : The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to
paragraph (1) above, subject to the following special rules:
(i) Surviving Eligible Spouse’ s Annuity : Subject to subparagraph (iii) below and the
last sentence of this subparagraph, if the
- 34 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Participant has an Eligible Spouse, the Participant’ s Eligible Spouse shall be entitled to receive a
survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the Participant’ s Annuity under this section, with no
corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving Eligible
Spouse shall begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’ s death and
shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to the Eligible Spouse’ s death. If the Eligible Spouse
is more than 10 years younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable under this
subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided below .
(A) For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving
Eligible Spouse is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall
be reduced by 0.8 percent.
(B) For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse is
younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall be reduced by an
additional 0.4 percent.
(ii) Reductions : The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’ s
PEP Guarantee.
(A) If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment
amount shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit
commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal Retirement Date.
- 35 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(B) If the Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment amount
shall be reduced to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement
Date (if payment commences before such date), and the Section 4.6(b) reductions for any Pre-
Retirement Spouse’ s coverage shall apply .
(C) This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form
that provides an Eligible Spouse benefit, continuing for the life of the surviving spouse, that is
greater than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’ s Pension
under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the
Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the Pension otherwise payable under the
foregoing provisions of this section.
(D) This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form
that provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse. In this instance,
the Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit
payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of a Single Life Annuity for the
Participant’ s life.
(E) This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in an
Annuity form that includes inflation protection described in Section 6.2(b). In this instance, the
Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit
- 36 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the elected Annuity without such
protection.
(iii) Lump Sum Conversion : The amount of the Retirement Pension determined
under this section for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a lump
sum shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under this section,
taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and any early
retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
5.3    Amount of Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pre-409A Pension : The monthly amount of the Pre-
Retirement Spouse’ s Pre-409A Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse of a Post-2004 Participant under
Section 4.6 shall be determined under subsection (a) below .
(a) Calculation : An Eligible Spouse’ s Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pre-409A Pension shall be equal
to:
(1)     The Eligible Spouse’ s Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension, reduced by
(2)     The Eligible Spouse’ s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension.
(b) Definitions : The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1) An Eligible Spouse’ s “Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension” means the
greater of:
(i) The amount of the Eligible Spouse’ s pre-retirement spouse’ s pension determined
under the principles and limitations of
- 37 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Section 5.1(b) and under the terms of the Salaried Plan in ef fect on December 31, 2004 (except
as otherwise applicable under Section 5.1(b)), but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed
by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied
under the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of the Salaried
Plan (relating to benefits that are deferred beyond the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date); or
(ii) The amount (if any) of the Eligible Spouse’ s PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement
Spouse’ s Pension determined under the principles and limitations of Section 5.1(b) and under
subsection (c).
In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated
with reference to the specific time of payment applicable to the Eligible Spouse.
(2)    An “Eligible Spouse’ s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension” means
the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension that would be payable to the Eligible Spouse under the principles
and limitations of Section 5.1(b) under the terms of the Salaried Plan in ef fect on December 31, 2004
(except as otherwise applicable under Section 5.1(b)).
(c) PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension : An Eligible Spouse’ s PEP Guarantee Pre-
Retirement Spouse’ s Pension shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below , whichever is
applicable, with reference to the PEP Guarantee (if any) that would have been available to the Participant
under Section 5.2.
- 38 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(1) Normal Rule : The Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension payable under this
paragraph shall be equal to the amount that would be payable as a survivor annuity , under a Qualified
Joint and Survivor Annuity , if the Participant had:
(i) Separated from service on the earliest of the date of death, his actual
Severance from Service Date;
(ii) Commenced a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the same date
payments of the Qualified Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension are to commence; and
(iii) Died on the day immediately following such commencement.
If payment of a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension under this paragraph commences or is deemed to
commence prior to the date which would have been the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date,
appropriate reductions for early commencement shall be applied to the Qualified Joint and Survivor
Annuity upon which the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension is based.
(2) Special Rule for Active and Disabled Employees : Notwithstanding paragraph (1)
above, the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension paid on behalf of a Participant described in Section 4.6(a)
shall not be less than an amount equal to 25 percent of such Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined
under Section 5.2 in accordance with the principles and limitations of Section 5.1(b) (if a comparable 25
percent benefit is available on behalf of the Participant
- 39 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
under the Salaried Plan). A Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension under this paragraph is not reduced for
early commencement.
5.4    Certain Adjustments : Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are
subject to adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the
Salaried Plan or a nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it
is sponsored by a member of the PepsiCo Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals.
(a) Adjustments for Rehired Participants : This subsection shall apply to a current or former
Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is
recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service. In the event of any such recalculation, the
Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension shall also be recalculated hereunder . For this purpose, the PEP Guarantee
under Section 5.2 is adjusted for in-service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits
are adjusted under the Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified
plans.
(b) Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans : If the benefit paid under a specified
plan on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether
the increase is by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise),
the PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment
hereunder , the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is
specifically intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.
- 40 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
5.5    Excludable Employment : Effective for periods of employment on or after June 30, 1997, an
executive classified as level 22 or above (or the equivalent) whose employment by an Employer is for a limited
duration assignment shall not become entitled to a benefit or to any increase in benefits in connection with such
employment. In addition, in the case of agreements entered into after January 1, 2009, an executive who has signed

employment (whichever applies). Written agreements may be entered into either before or after the executive
becomes eligible for or begins participation in the Plan, and such written agreement may take any form that is
deemed ef fective by the Company . All written agreements under this section 5.5 shall be irrevocable by the individual
once executed.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Article VI.
Distribution Options
The terms of this Article govern (i) the distribution of benefits to a Participant who becomes entitled to a
Pre-409A Pension, and (ii) the continuation of benefits (if any) to such Participant’ s beneficiary following the
Participant’ s death. Other than as set forth in section 4.9 (cashout distributions), a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension
derived from the Pre-409A Program shall be payable as an Annuity for the life of the Eligible Spouse (except as
provided in Article VI of Part B of the Salaried Plan). The distribution of a 409A Pension is governed by the terms of
the 409A Program.
6.1    Form and T iming of Distributions : This section shall govern the form and timing of distributions of
Pre-409A Pensions that begin on or after March 1, 1992. Plan distributions that begin before that date shall be
governed by the prior terms of the Plan. The provisions of this Section 6.1 are in all cases subject to the cashout rules
set forth in Section 4.9.
(a) No Advance Election : This subsection shall apply to a Participant: (i) who does not have an
Advance Election in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, or (ii) who
terminates employment prior to Retirement. Subject to the next sentence, a Participant described in this
subsection shall be paid his Pre-409A Pension in the same form and at the same time as he is paid his
Pension under the Salaried Plan. If a Participant’ s Salaried Plan Annuity Starting Date occurs while he is still
an employee of the PepsiCo Organization (because of the time of payment provisions in Code section 401(a)
(9)), payment under the Plan shall not begin until the first of the month next following the Participant’ s
Severance from Service Date. In this instance, the form of payment under this Plan shall remain that
applicable under the
- 42 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Salaried Plan. If the Participant will be paid his pension under the Salaried Plan in a form of payment that is
not available to the Participant under this Pre-409A Program ( e.g., because the Participant attains Retirement
status under the Salaried Plan but does not attain Retirement status under this Pre-409A Program, based on
applying the terms of the Salaried Plan in ef fect on December 31, 2004), the principles of subsection (b)(2)
below will govern the determination of the Participant’ s form of payment.
(b) Advance Election in Ef fect: This subsection shall apply to a Participant who has an Advance
Election in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date. To be in ef fect, an
Advance Election must meet the advance receipt and other requirements of Section 6.3(b).
(1) Lump Sum Election : If a Participant covered by this subsection has an Advance
Election to receive a Single Lump Sum in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his
Retirement Date, the Participant’ s Pre-409A Retirement Pension under the Plan shall be paid as a
Single Lump Sum as of the first of the month coincident with or next following his Retirement Date.
(2) Annuity Election : If a Participant covered by this subsection has an Advance Election
to receive an Annuity in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, the
Participant’ s Pre-409A Retirement Pension under the Plan shall be paid in an Annuity beginning on the
first of the month coincident with or next following his Retirement Date. The following provisions of this
paragraph govern the form of Annuity payable in the case of a Participant described in this paragraph.
- 43 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(i) Salaried Plan Election : A Participant who has a qualifying Salaried Plan election
shall receive his distribution in the same form of Annuity the Participant selected in such
qualifying Salaried Plan election. For this purpose, a “qualifying Salaried Plan election” is a
written election of a form of payment by the Participant that: (A) is currently in ef fect under the
Salaried Plan as of the close of business on the day before the Participant’ s Retirement Date,
and (B) specifies an Annuity as the form of payment for all or part of the Participant’ s
Retirement Pension under the Salaried Plan. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a
Participant who elects a combination lump sum and Annuity under the Salaried Plan is
considered to have specified an Annuity for part of his Salaried Plan Pension.
(ii) PEP Election : A Participant who is not covered by subparagraph (i) and who has
a PEP Election in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date shall
receive his distribution in the form of Annuity the Participant selects in such PEP Election.
(iii) No PEP Election : A Participant who is not covered by subparagraph (i) or (ii)
above shall receive his distribution in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity if he is

the beneficiary’ s death.

- 46 -

(4) Combination Lump Sum/Monthly Benefit Option : A Participant who does not have an
Advance Election in ef fect may receive a portion of his Pre-409A Pension in the form of a lump sum
payment, and the remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits described in paragraphs
(1) and (2) above. The Pre-409A Pension is divided between the two forms of payment based on the
whole number percentages designated by the Participant on a form provided for this purpose by the
Plan Administrator . For the election to be ef fective, the sum of the two percentages designated by the
Participant must equal 100 percent.
(i) The amount of the Pre-409A Pension paid in the form of a lump sum is

percentage that the Participant has designated for receipt in the form of a lump sum.
(ii) The amount of the Pre-409A Pension paid in the form of a monthly benefit is

Participant has designated for receipt in the form of a monthly benefit.
(b) Inflation Protection : The following levels of inflation protection may be provided to any
Participant who is entitled to a Pre-409A Retirement Pension (except to the extent such Pre-409A Pension is
paid as a lump sum).
(1) 5 Percent Inflation Protection : A Participant’ s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced,
but thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 5 percent. The amount of the
increase shall be the dif ference between inflation in the prior year and 5 percent.
(2) 7 Percent Inflation Protection : A Participant’ s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced,
but thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 7 percent. The amount of the
increase shall be the dif ference between inflation in the prior year and 7 percent.
Benefits shall be subject to increase in accordance with this subsection each January 1, beginning with the
second January 1 following the Participant’ s Annuity Starting Date. The amount of inflation in the prior year
shall be determined based on inflation in the 12-month period ending on September 30 of such year , with
inflation measured in the same manner as applies on the Ef fective Date for adjusting Social Security benefits
for changes in the cost of living. Inflation protection that is in ef fect shall carry over to any survivor benefit
payable on behalf of a Participant, and shall increase the otherwise applicable survivor benefit as provided
above. Any election by a Participant to receive inflation protection shall be irrevocable by such Participant or
his surviving beneficiary .

Any Advance Election by a Participant shall be void if the Participant is not entitled to a Pre-409A Retirement
Pension.
(c) PEP Election : A PEP Election may only be made by a Participant who has an Advance
Election to receive an Annuity in ef fect at the time his PEP Election is received by the Plan Administrator . In

subsection (b)(2) shall be considered met if it will be met by the Participant’ s proposed Retirement Date.
(1) Election : The Participant shall designate on the PEP Election form the Annuity form of
benefit the Participant selects from those described in Section 6.2, including the Participant’ s choice of
inflation protection, subject to the provisions of this Article VI. The forms of payment described in

(2) Receipt by the Plan Administrator : The PEP Election must be received by the Plan
Administrator no earlier than 180 days (90 days prior to January 1, 2007) before the Participant’ s

any form of payment which is subject to reduction in accordance with subsection 6.2(c) above.
A Participant may change his PEP Election by filing a new Election with the Plan Administrator that meets the
foregoing requirements. The Participant’ s PEP Election shall become ef fective at the close of business on the

does not have an Advance Election in ef fect at such time.
(d) Elections Rules for Annuity Starting Dates : When amounts become payable to a Participant
in accordance with Article IV , they shall be payable as of the Participant’ s Annuity Starting Date and the
election procedures (in this section and Sections 6.1 and 6.5) shall apply to all of the Participant’ s unpaid
accruals under this Pre-409A Program as of such Annuity Starting Date, with the following exception. In the
case of a Participant who is rehired after his initial Annuity Starting Date and who (i) is currently receiving an
Annuity that remained in pay status upon rehire, or (ii) was previously paid a lump sum distribution (other than
a cashout distribution described in Section 4.9(a)), the Participant’ s subsequent Annuity Starting Date (as a
result of his termination of reemployment), and the election procedures at such subsequent Annuity Starting
Date, shall apply only to the portion of his benefit that accrues after his rehire. Any prior accruals that remain to
be paid as of the Participant’ s subsequent Annuity Starting Date shall continue to be payable in accordance

For purposes of this section, an election shall be treated as received on a particular day if it is: (A) postmarked that
day, or (B) actually received by the Plan Administrator on that day . Delivery under clause (B) must be made by the
close of business, which time is to be determined by the Plan Administrator .
6.4    Special Rules for Survivor Options :
(a) Effect of Certain Deaths : If a Participant makes a PEP Election for a form of payment
described in Section 6.2(a)(2) and the Participant or his beneficiary (beneficiaries in the case of Section 6.2(a)
(2)(iv)) dies before the PEP Election becomes ef fective, the election shall be disregarded. If the Participant
dies after such PEP Election becomes ef fective but before his Pre-409A Retirement Pension actually
commences, the election shall be given ef fect and the amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse or other
beneficiary shall commence on the first day of the month following his death (any back payments due the
Participant shall be payable to his estate). In the case of a Participant who has elected the form of payment
described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), if such Participant dies: (i) after the PEP Election has become ef fective, (ii)
without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary , and (iii) before receiving 120 payments under the form of
payment, then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to the Participant’ s
estate. If payments have commenced under such form of payment to a Participant’ s primary or contingent
beneficiary and such beneficiary dies before payments are completed, then the remaining payments due under
such form of payment shall be paid to such beneficiary’ s estate.
- 52 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(b) Nonspouse Beneficiaries : If a Participant’ s beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse, he may not
elect:
(i) The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(i) if his
nonspouse beneficiary is more than 10 years younger than he is, or
(ii) The 75 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(ii) if his nonspouse
beneficiary is more than 19 years younger than he is.
6.5    Designation of Beneficiary : A Participant who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a
form of payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a beneficiary who will be entitled to any amounts
payable on his death. Such designation shall be made on a PEP Election Form or an approved election form filed
under the Salaried Plan, whichever is applicable. In the case of the survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv),
the Participant shall be entitled to name both a primary beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary . A Participant
(whether active or former) shall have the right to change or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to
when his election is finally ef fective. The designation of any beneficiary , and any change or revocation thereof, shall
be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator . A beneficiary designation shall not be ef fective
unless and until filed with the Plan Administrator . If no beneficiary is properly designated, then a Participant’ s election
of a survivor ’s option described in Section 6.2(a)(2) shall not be given ef fect. A Participant entitled to a Pre-409A
Vested Pension does not have the right or ability to name a beneficiary; if the Participant is permitted under Section
6.2 to elect an optional form of payment, then his beneficiary shall be his Eligible Spouse on his Annuity Starting
Date.

Participant’ s FICA Amount and the related withholding of income tax at source on wages (imposed under Code
Section 3401 or the corresponding withholding provisions of the applicable state, local or foreign tax laws as a result
of the payment of the FICA Amount) and the additional withholding of income tax at source on wages that is
attributable to the pyramiding of wages and taxes (all such amounts due are referred to collectively as “Employment
Taxes”). To the extent that a Participant’ s 409A Pension, if any , is insuf ficient to pay the Employment T axes when due
(including if the Participant’ s 409A Pension has not commenced at the time the Employment T axes are due), a
portion of the Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension, if any , shall be paid as a single lump sum and remitted directly to the
applicable tax authority in satisfaction of any amounts necessary to satisfy fully the Employment T axes.

Article VII.
Administration
7.1    Authority to Administer Plan : The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator , which shall
have the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as it deems appropriate. The Plan Administrator
shall maintain Plan records and make benefit calculations, and may rely upon information furnished it by the
Participant in writing, including the Participant’ s current mailing address, age and marital status. The Plan
Administrator ’s interpretations, determinations, regulations and calculations shall be final and binding on all persons
and parties concerned. Neither the Company nor the Plan Administrator shall be a fiduciary of the Plan, and any
restrictions that might apply to a party in interest under section 406 of ERISA shall not apply under the Plan, including
with respect to the Company or the Plan Administrator .
7.2    Facility of Payment : Whenever , in the Plan Administrator ’s opinion, a person entitled to receive
any payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so
as to be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the Plan Administrator may make payments to such person or to the
legal representative of such person for his benefit, or the Plan Administrator may apply the payment for the benefit of
such person in such manner as it considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance
with the provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under
the provisions of the Plan.
7.3    Claims Procedure : The Plan Administrator shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to
construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of
such benefits, and its decisions on such matters
- 55 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
are final and conclusive. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its
discretion that the person claiming such benefits is entitled to them. This discretionary authority is intended to be
absolute, and in any case where the extent of this discretion is in question, the Plan Administrator is to be accorded
the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court, arbitrator
or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the abuse of discretion standard). If, pursuant to this
discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Participant or beneficiary (a
“claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator , or a party designated by the Plan Administrator , will
provide such claimant the claims review process described in this Section. The Plan Administrator has the
discretionary right to modify the claims process described in this Section in any manner so long as the claims review
process, as modified, includes the steps described below . Within a 90-day response period following the receipt of
the claim by the Plan Administrator , the Plan Administrator will notice the claimant of:
(a) The specific reason or reasons for the denial;
(b) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(c) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit
to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
(d) A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to
such process and a statement of the claimant’ s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following a further
denial on review).
- 56 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances required an extension of time for processing the claim
it may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant
before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date
by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decision. Further review of a claim is available upon written
request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the claimant receives written notice of the
denial of the claim. Upon review , the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim,
including the opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments, documents, records and other information
relevant to the claim and the Plan Administrator ’s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records
and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on
review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances warrant an extension
of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant
before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date
by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decisions. The final decision shall be in writing and drafted
in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and include specific reasons for the decision with references
to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator , or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely
on the basis of the record before the Plan Administrator at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such
review shall be conditioned on the claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this Section as is more fully
explained in Section 7.5. Any
- 57 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
notice or other notification that is required to be sent to a claimant under this Section may be sent pursuant to any
method approved under Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1 or other applicable guidance.
7.4    Effect of Specific References : Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator ’s discretion shall
create no inference that the Plan Administrator ’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other
provision, is less complete or broad.
7.5    Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’ s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court . Before filing any Claim
(including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’ s
rights under the claims procedures of Section 7.3.
(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 is
intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps
necessary to clarify or ef fect this intent may be taken).
(b)    In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion
of the Plan’ s claims procedure as described in this Section 7.5, the subsequent action or consideration shall be
limited, to the maximum extent permissible, to the record that was before the Plan Administrator in the claims
procedure.
(c)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other
Disputes that are not Claims (including those that a court might consider at the same time) are of greater
significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Plan Administrator may choose to provide in connection with
novel Disputes
- 58 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential and (iv) even if the Plan
Administrator has not previously defined or established specific claims procedures that directly apply to the
submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the Plan Administrator (upon notice of the Claim)
shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act by analogy to) the claims
procedures of Section 7.5 that apply to claims for benefits).
(d)    The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class
basis or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be
made as are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.
(e)    For purposes of this Section 7.5, the following definitions apply .
(i)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, action or other matter .
(ii)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of the
following –
(A)    The interpretation of the Plan;
(B)    The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan;
(C)     The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light of
applicable law;
(D)    Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been validly
adopted or put into ef fect;
(E)    The administration of the Plan;
- 59 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(F)    Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms, conditions or
requirements of ERISA or other applicable law or regulation, regardless of whether such terms,
conditions or requirements are, in whole or in part, incorporated into the terms, conditions or
requirements of the Plan;
(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;
(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any fiduciary duty; or
(I)    Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the Plan
Administrator , or (ii) relates to the Plan in any way .
(iii)    A “Claimant” is any Employee, former Employee, Participant, former Participant,
Beneficiary (or the spouse, former spouse, estate, heir or representative of any of the foregoing
individuals), or any other individual, person, entity with a relationship to any of the foregoing individuals
or the Plan, as well as any group of one or more of the foregoing, who has a Claim.
7.6    Limitations on Actions . Effective for claims and actions filed on or after January 1, 2011, any claim
filed under Article VII and any action filed in state or federal court by or on behalf of a former or current Employee,
Participant, beneficiary or any other individual, person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful
denial of Plan benefits or for the alleged interference with or violation of ERISA-protected rights must be brought
within two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of this
- 60 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not
later than the earliest of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the
claim or legal action, (ii) the date identified to the Petitioner by the Plan Administrator on which payments shall
commence, or (iii) when the Petitioner has actual or constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his
claim. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to the alleged interference with ERISA-
protected rights shall be deemed to accrue when the claimant has actual or constructive knowledge of the acts that
are alleged to interfere with ERISA-protected rights. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-
year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of
action. Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals process described in Section 7.3
shall have no ef fect on this two-year time frame.
7.7    Restriction on V enue . Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the
Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner (as defined in Section 7.6 above) shall only be brought or filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New Y ork, ef fective for claims or actions filed on or after January 1,
2011.

Article VIII.
Miscellaneous
8.1    No Guarantee of Employment : Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of
employment between an Employer and any Employee, or as a right of any Employee to be continued in the
employment of an Employer , or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its Employees, with or
without cause.
8.2    Nonalienation of Benefits : Benefits payable under the Plan or the right to receive future benefits
under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer , assignment, pledge,
encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution, or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary , and any attempt to
anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer , assign, pledge, encumber , charge or otherwise dispose of any right to benefits
payable hereunder , including any assignment or alienation in connection with a divorce, separation, child support or
similar arrangement, shall be null and void and not binding on the Company . The Company shall not in any manner
be liable for , or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits
hereunder .
8.3    Unfunded Plan : The Company’ s obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall
constitute liabilities by the Company payable when due out of the Company’ s general funds. To the extent the
Participant or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than
the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Company .
8.4    Action by the Company : Any action by the Company under this Plan, including any amendment
authorized to be made under Section 9.2, may be made by the Board
- 62 -

under this Pre-409A Program as being exempt from Section 409A, i.e., to preserve the grandfathered status of this
Pre-409A Program. In all cases, the provision of the prior sentence shall apply notwithstanding any contrary provision
of the Plan. Accordingly , in determining rights and benefits under this Pre-409A Program, changes in the Salaried
Plan that are ef fective after December 31, 2004 shall be disregarded to the extent necessary to avoid a modification
of this Pre-409A Program that would constitute a material modification for purposes of Section 409A.
8.7    Authorized T ransfers : If a Participant transfers to an entity that is not part of the PepsiCo
Organization, the liability for any benefits accrued while the Participant was employed by the PepsiCo Organization

Article IX.
Amendment and T ermination
This Article governs the Company’ s right to amend and or terminate the Plan. The Company’ s
amendment and termination powers under this Article shall be subject, in all cases, to the restrictions on amendment
and termination in Section 409A and shall be exercised in accordance with such restrictions to ensure continued
exemption from Section 409A in accordance with Section 8.6.
9.1    Continuation of the Plan : While the Company and the Employers intend to continue the Plan
indefinitely , they assume no contractual obligation as to its continuance. In accordance with Section 8.4, the
Company hereby reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any
time provided, however , that no such amendment or termination shall adversely af fect the amount of benefit to which
a Participant or his beneficiary is entitled under Article IV on the date of such amendment or termination, unless the

Company (except as necessary to preserve the exemption from Section 409A of this Pre-409A Program). Specific
forms of payment are not protected under the preceding sentence.
9.2    Amendments : The Company may , in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to
this Plan from time to time, with or without retroactive ef fect, including any amendment or amendments to eliminate
available distribution options under Article VI hereof at any time before the earlier of the Participant’ s Annuity Starting
Date under this Plan or under the Salaried Plan; provided, however , that no amendment of the Plan shall be ef fective
to the extent that the amendment would be considered a “material modification” (as
- 64 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

ERISA Plan Structure
This Plan document in conjunction with the plan document(s) for the 409A Program encompasses three
separate plans within the meaning of ERISA, as are set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c). This division into
separate plans shall be ef fective as of July 1, 1996; previously the plans set forth in subsections (b) and (c) were a
single plan within the meaning of ERISA.
(a) Excess Benefit Plan : An excess benefit plan within the meaning of section 3(36) of ERISA,
maintained solely for the purpose of providing benefits for Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations
on benefits imposed by section 415 of the Code.
(b) Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan : A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the
purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees within the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. The plan provides benefits for
Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations imposed by section 401(a)(17) of the Code on benefits
under the Salaried Plan (after taking into account any benefits under the excess benefit plan). For ERISA
reporting purposes, this portion of PEP may be referred to as the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan I.
(c) Preservation T op Hat Plan : A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the purpose of
providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within

benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan and Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan). For ERISA reporting
purposes, this portion of PEP may be referred to as the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan II.
Benefits under this Plan shall be allocated first to the Excess Benefit Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the
purpose indicated in (a) above; then any remaining benefits shall be allocated to the Excess Compensation T op Hat
Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the purpose indicated in (b) above; then any remaining benefits shall be

ARTICLE A
Accruals for 1993 and 1994
This Article A of the Appendix shall be ef fective on the date the Plan is adopted.
A.1 Accruals for 1993 and 1994 : This section shall apply to any individual:
(i) who is a Salaried Plan Participant and employed by the PepsiCo Organization on
December 31, 1993, (ii) whose Salaried Plan Pension is vested during 1993 (or would become vested in 1994 if his
Service included the assumed period of continued service specified in (a)(1) below), and (iii) whose minimum 1993
Pension in subsection (a) below is not derived solely from that portion of the Plan described in (c) of Article X. In
determining the amount of the 1993 and 1994 Pension amounts for any such individual, the provisions set forth in
subsections (a) and (b) below shall apply .
(a) Minimum 1993 Pension : Any individual who is covered by this section shall accrue a
minimum 1993 Pension as of December 31, 1993. In determining the amount of such individual’ s minimum
1993 Pension, the following shall apply .
(1) An individual’ s Service and Credited Service as of the end of 1993 shall be assumed to
equal the respective Service and Credited Service he would have if his Service continued through
December 31, 1994. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the assumed period of continued Service
shall be less to the extent the Corporation’ s human resource records on December 31, 1993 reflect a
scheduled termination date in 1994 for such individual. In this case, the individual’ s assumed period of
continued service shall be the portion of 1994 that ends with such scheduled termination date.
(2) An individual’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings as of the end of 1993 shall be
adjusted by the actuary’ s salary scale assumption which is used under the Salaried Plan, so that they
equal the amount such scale projects for the individual as of the end of 1994. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, the following special rules shall apply .
- 71 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(i) A higher salary scale assumption shall be used for anyone whose projected
1994 earnings as reflected on the “Special PEP Salary Scale” of the PepsiCo Benefits
Department on December 31, 1993 are higher than would be assumed under the first sentence
of this paragraph. In this case, the individual’ s 1993 earnings shall be adjusted using such
higher salary scale.
(ii) In the case of an individual whose assumed period of service under paragraph
(1) above is less than all of 1994, the salary adjustment under the preceding provisions of this
paragraph shall be reduced to the amount that would apply if the individual had no earnings
after his scheduled termination date.
(3) An individual’ s attained age as of the end of 1993 shall be assumed to be the age he
would have at the end of the assumed period of continued service applicable under paragraph (1)
above.
Any individual who is covered by this section, and who is not otherwise vested as of December 31, 1993, shall
be vested as of such date in both his Pension (determined without regard to this subsection) and his minimum
1993 Pension. For purposes of this subsection, Code section 401(a)(17) shall be applied in 1993 by giving
effect to the amendments to such Code section made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Amendments of
1993.
(b) Determination of 1994 Accrual : If a participant in the Salaried Plan accrues a minimum 1993
Pension under subsection (a) above, the amount of any PEP
- 72 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Pension for 1994 that accrues shall be only the amount by which the PEP Pension that would otherwise
accrue for 1994 exceeds his minimum 1993 Pension under
subsection (a).

form and will commence as of the same time as his pension under the Salaried Plan, then his Pension
hereunder shall be the dif ference between:
(1) His T otal Pension expressed in such form and payable as of such time, minus
(2) His Salaried Plan Pension expressed in such form and payable as of such time.
- 74 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(b) Different Form than Salaried Plan : If a Pre-2005 Participant’ s Pension will be paid in a
different form (whether in whole or in part) or will commence as of a dif ferent time than his pension under the

value of his Salaried Plan Pension, and the denominator of which is the value of his T otal Pension (with
value determined on a reasonable and consistent basis, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator , with
respect to similarly situated employees).
(c) Definitions : The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1) A Pre-2005 Participant’ s “Total Pension” means the greater of:
(i) The amount of the Pre-2005 Participant’ s pension determined under the terms of
the Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and

pensionable earnings” means the Pre-2005 Participant’ s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year , within the
meaning of the Salaried Plan as in ef fect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include remuneration
from an entity attributable to any period when that entity was not an Employer .

- 76 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
below . However , if the Pre-2005 Participant was actively employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a
classification eligible for the Salaried Plan prior to July 1, 1975, the amount of his Pension under this
paragraph shall be the greater of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (i) and (ii), provided
that subparagraph (ii)(B) shall not apply in determining the amount of a V ested Pension.
(i) Formula A : The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be:
(A) 3 percent of the Pre-2005 Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly

Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at his Severance from
Service Date, and then shall be reduced by multiplying
- 77 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Pre-2005 Participant’ s actual
years of Credited Service on his Severance from Service Date and the denominator of which is
the years of Credited Service he would have earned had he remained in the employ of an
Employer until his Normal Retirement Age.
(ii)    Formula B : The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be the greater
of (A) or (B) below:
(A)    1-1/2 percent of Highest A verage Monthly Earnings times the number
of years of Credited Service, less 50 percent of the Pre-2005 Participant’ s Primary Social
Security Amount, or
(B)    3 percent of Highest A verage Monthly Earnings times the number of
years of Credited Service up to 15 years, less 50 percent of the Pre-2005 Participant’ s
Primary Social Security Amount.
In determining the amount of a Disability Pension under Formula A or B above, the Pension shall be
calculated on the basis of the Pre-2005 Participant’ s Credited Service (determined in accordance with
Section 3.3(d)(3) of the Salaried Plan), and his Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Primary Social
Security Amount at the date of disability .
(2) Calculation : The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to

- 78 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(i) Surviving Eligible Spouse’ s Annuity : Subject to subparagraph (iii) below and the
last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Pre-2005 Participant has an Eligible Spouse, the Pre-
2005 Participant’ s Eligible Spouse shall be entitled to receive a survivor annuity equal to 50
percent of the Pre-2005 Participant’ s Annuity under this section, with no corresponding
reduction in such Annuity for the Pre-2005 Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving Eligible
Spouse shall begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Pre-2005
Participant’ s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to the Eligible
Spouse’ s death. If the Eligible Spouse is more than 10 years younger than the Pre-2005
Participant, the survivor benefit payable under this subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided
below .

Eligible Spouse is younger than the Pre-2005 Participant, the survivor benefit payable to
such spouse shall be reduced by 0.8 percent.

younger than the Pre-2005 Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall
be reduced by an additional 0.4 percent.
(ii) Reductions : The following reductions shall apply in determining a Pre-2005
Participant’ s PEP Guarantee.

payment amount shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent for each month by which the
benefit commencement date precedes the date the Pre-2005 Participant would attain his
Normal Retirement Date.
(B) If the Pre-2005 Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment
amount shall be reduced to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal
Retirement Date (if payment commences before such date), and the Section 4.6(b)
reductions for any Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s coverage shall apply .
(C) This clause applies if the Pre-2005 Participant will receive his Pension in
a form that provides an Eligible Spouse benefit, continuing for the life of the surviving
spouse, that is greater than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Pre-
2005 Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of
the benefit payable on the Pre-2005 Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the
Pension otherwise payable under the foregoing provisions of this section.
(D) This clause applies if the Pre-2005 Participant will receive his Pension in
a form that provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse. In
this instance,
- 80 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
the Pre-2005 Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total
value of the benefit payable on the Pre-2005 Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial
Equivalent of a Single Life Annuity for the Pre-2005 Participant’ s life.
(E) This clause applies if the Pre-2005 Participant will receive his Pension in
an Annuity form that includes inflation protection described in Section 6.2(b). In this
instance, the Pre-2005 Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that

under this section for a Pre-2005 Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in
the form of a lump sum shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Pre-2005 Participant’ s PEP
Guarantee determined under this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit
under subparagraph (i) above and any early retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A)
above.
5.3 Amount of Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension : The monthly amount of the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s
Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse under Section 4.6 shall be determined under subsection (a) below .

(2) The Eligible Spouse’ s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension.

(i) The amount of the Eligible Spouse’ s pre-retirement spouse’ s pension determined
under the terms of the Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by
sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied under
the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of the Salaried Plan;
or

- 82 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
the PEP Guarantee (if any) that would have been available to the Pre-2005 Participant under Section 5.2.
(1) Normal Rule : The Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension payable under this paragraph
shall be equal to the amount that would be payable as a survivor annuity , under a Qualified Joint and
Survivor Annuity , if the Pre-2005 Participant had:
(i) Separated from service on the date of death (or , if earlier , his actual Severance
from Service Date);
(ii) Commenced a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the same date payments
of the Qualified Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension are to commence; and
(iii) Died on the day immediately following such commencement.
If payment of a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension under this paragraph commences prior to the date
which would have been the Pre-2005 Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date, appropriate reductions for
early commencement shall be applied to the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity upon which the Pre-
Retirement Spouse’ s Pension is based.
(2) Special Rule for Active and Disabled Employees Who Die Prior to June 1, 2009 :
Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension paid on behalf of a Pre-2005
Participant described in Section 4.6(a) who dies prior to June 1, 2009 shall not be less than an amount equal
to 25 percent of such Pre-2005 Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under Section 5.2. For this purpose,

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
ARTICLE I – Foreword
The PEP Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PBG for the benefit of salaried
employees of the PBG Organization who participate in the PBG Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried
Plan”). PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by
the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP provides benefits for certain
eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula.
This Plan is first ef fective April 6, 1999. The Plan is a successor plan to the PepsiCo Pension Equalization
Plan, which was last restated ef fective as of January 1, 1989. The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan covers eligible
employees at the various divisions of PepsiCo, Inc., including eligible employees who are employed at various Pepsi-
Cola Company facilities. On April 6, 1999, when this Plan became ef fective, PBG had its initial public of fering. PBG
employs many of the individuals employed at Pepsi-Cola Company facilities who were covered under the PepsiCo
Pension Equalization Plan. This initial Plan document closely mirrors the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan
document, including its historical provisions which are relevant for eligibility and benefit determinations under this
Plan.

Spouse is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall be
reduced by 0.8 percent.
(B)    For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse is younger
than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall be reduced by an
additional 0.4 percent.
(ii)    Reductions : The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’ s PEP
Guarantee.
(A)    If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment
amount shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent
- 109 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
for each month by which the benefit commencement date precedes the date the Participant
would attain his Normal Retirement Date.
(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment amount shall be
reduced to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date (if
payment commences before such date), and the Section 4.6(b) reductions for any Pre-
Retirement Spouse’ s coverage shall apply .
(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form that
provides an Eligible Spouse benefit, continuing for the life of the surviving spouse, that is greater
than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’ s Pension under this
section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf
is the Actuarial Equivalent of the Pension otherwise payable under the foregoing provisions of
this section.
(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form that
provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse. In this instance, the
Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit
payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of a Single Life Annuity for the
Participant’ s life.
(E)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in an Annuity
form that includes inflation protection described in Section 6.2(b). In this instance, the
Participant’ s Pension under this
- 110 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf
is the Actuarial Equivalent of the elected Annuity without such protection.
(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion : The amount of the Retirement Pension determined under
this section for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a lump sum
shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under this section,
taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and any early
retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
5.3    Amount of Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension : The monthly amount of the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s
Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse under Section 4.6 shall be determined under subsection (a) below .
(a)    Calculation : An Eligible Spouse’ s Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension shall be the dif ference
between:
(1)    The Eligible Spouse’ s Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension, minus
(2)    The Eligible Spouse’ s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension.
(b)    Definitions : The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1)    An Eligible Spouse’ s “Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension” means the greater of:
(i)    The amount of the Eligible Spouse’ s pre-retirement spouse’ s pension determined
under the terms of the Salaried Plan, but without
- 111 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such limitations
are interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial adjustment under Section
5.6(d) of Part C of the Salaried Plan; or (ii)    The amount (if any) of the Eligible Spouse’ s PEP
Guarantee Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension determined under subsection (c).
In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated with reference
to the specific time of payment applicable to the Eligible Spouse.
(c)    PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension : An Eligible Spouse’ s PEP Guarantee Pre-
Retirement Spouse’ s Pension shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below , whichever is
applicable, with reference to the PEP Guarantee (if any) that would have been available to the Participant under
Section 5.2.
(1)    Normal Rule : The Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension payable under this paragraph shall be
equal to the amount that would be payable as a survivor annuity , under a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity ,
if the Participant had:
(i)    Separated from service on the date of death (or , if earlier , his actual Severance from
Service Date);
(ii)    Commenced a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the same date payments of
the Qualified Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension are to commence; and (iii)    Died on the day
immediately following such commencement.
If payment of a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension under this paragraph commences prior to the date which
would have been the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date,
- 112 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
appropriate reductions for early commencement shall be applied to the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity
upon which the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension is based.
(2)    Special Rule for Active and Disabled Employees : Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, the
Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension paid on behalf of a Participant described in Section 4.6(a) shall not be less
than an amount equal to 25 percent of such Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under Section 5.2. For
this purpose, Credited Service shall be determined as provided in Section 3.3(d)(2) of Part C of the Salaried
Plan, and the deceased Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings, Primary Social Security Amount and
Covered Compensation shall be determined as of his date of death. A Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension
under this paragraph is not reduced for early commencement.
5.4    Certain Adjustments : Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject to
adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan or a
nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored by a
member of the PBG Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals (this category of similar
plans includes the PepsiCo Prior Plan).
(a)    Adjustments for Rehired Participants : This subsection shall apply to a current or former Participant
who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is recalculated based
on an additional period of Credited Service. In the event of any such recalculation, the Participant’ s Pre-409A
Pension shall also be recalculated hereunder . For this purpose, the PEP Guarantee under Section 5.2 is adjusted for
in-service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted
- 113 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
under the Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified plans.
(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans : If the benefit paid under a specified plan on
behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the increase is
by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), the PEP benefit for the
Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder , the Plan Administrator shall
take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically intended that there shall be no
duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.
5.5    Excludable Employment : Effective for periods of employment on or after June 30, 1997, an executive
classified as level 22 or above whose employment by an Employer is for a limited duration assignment shall not
become entitled to a benefit or to any increase in benefits in connection with such employment.
ARTICLE VI – Distribution Options
The terms of this Article govern the distribution of benefits to a Participant who becomes entitled to payment of
a Pension under the Plan.
6.1    Form and T iming of Distributions : This section shall govern the form and timing of distributions of Pre-
409A Pensions that begin on or after March 1, 1992. Plan distributions that begin before that date shall be governed
by Prior Plan as in ef fect at the time of the distribution. The provisions of this Section 6.1 are in all cases subject to
the cashout rules set forth in Section 4.9.
(a)    No Advance Election : This subsection shall apply to a Participant: (i) who does not have an
Advance Election in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his

Retirement Date, or (ii) who terminates employment prior to Retirement. Subject to the next sentence, a Participant
described in this subsection shall be paid his Pre-409A Pension in the same form and at the same time as he is paid
his Pension under the Salaried Plan. If a Participant’ s Salaried Plan Annuity Starting Date occurs while he is still an
employee of the PBG Organization (because of the time of payment provisions in Code section 401(a)(9)), payment
under the Plan shall not begin until the first of the month next following the Participant’ s Severance from Service
Date. In this instance, the form of payment under this Plan shall remain that applicable under the Salaried Plan.
(b)    Advance Election in Ef fect: This subsection shall apply to a Participant: (i) who has an Advance
Election in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, and (ii) whose Retirement Date is
after 1993. To be in ef fect, an Advance Election must meet the advance receipt and other requirements of Section
6.3(b).
(1)    Lump Sum Election : If a Participant covered by this subsection has an Advance Election to
receive a Single Lump Sum in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, the
Participant’ s Retirement Pension under the Plan shall be paid as a Single Lump Sum as of the first of the
month coincident with or next following his Retirement Date.
(2)    Annuity Election : If a Participant covered by this subsection has an Advance Election to
receive an Annuity in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, the Participant’ s
Retirement Pension under the Plan shall be paid in an Annuity beginning on the first of the month coincident
with or next following his Retirement Date. The following provisions of this paragraph govern the form of
Annuity payable in the case of a Participant described in this paragraph.
- 115 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(i)    Salaried Plan Election : A Participant who has a qualifying Salaried Plan election shall
receive his distribution in the same form of Annuity the Participant selected in such qualifying Salaried
Plan election. For this purpose, a “qualifying Salaried Plan election” is a written election of a form of
payment by the Participant that: (A) is currently in ef fect under the Salaried Plan as of the close of
business on the day before the Participant’ s Retirement Date, and (B) specifies an Annuity as the form
of payment for all or part of the Participant’ s Retirement Pension under the Salaried Plan. For purposes
of the preceding sentence, a Participant who elects a combination lump sum and Annuity under the
Salaried Plan is considered to have specified an Annuity for part of his Salaried Plan Pension.
(ii)    PEP Election : A Participant who is not covered by subparagraph (i) and who has a
PEP Election in ef fect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date shall receive
his distribution in the form of Annuity the Participant selects in such PEP Election.
(iii)    No PEP Election : A Participant who is not covered by subparagraph (i) or (ii) above
shall receive his distribution in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity if he is married, or in
the form of a Single Life Annuity if he is not married. For purposes of this subparagraph (iii), a
Participant shall be considered married if he is married on the day before his Retirement Date.
6.2    Available Forms of Payment : The forms of payment set forth in subsections (a) and (b) may be provided
to any Participant who is entitled to a Retirement Pension. The forms
- 116 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

Annuity Starting Dates after 1989 and earlier distributions shall be governed by the Prior Plan as in ef fect at the time
of distribution.
(a)    Basic Forms of Payment : A Participant’ s Retirement Pension shall be distributed in one of the
forms of payment listed in this subsection. The particular form of payment applicable to a Participant shall be
determined in accordance with Section 6.1. Payments shall commence on the date specified in Section 6.1 and shall
end on the date specified in this subsection.
(1)    Single Life Annuity Option : A Participant may receive his Pension in the form of a Single
Life Annuity , which provides monthly payments ending with the last payment due prior to his death.
(2)    Survivor Options : A Participant may receive his Pension in accordance with one of the
following survivor options:
(i)    100 percent Survivor Option : The Participant shall receive a reduced Pension payable
for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments in the same reduced
amount shall continue after the Participant’ s death to his beneficiary for life, beginning on the first day of
the month coincident with or following the Participant’ s death and ending with the last monthly payment
due prior to the beneficiary’ s death.
(ii)    75 percent Survivor Option : The Participant shall receive a reduced Pension payable
for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments in the amount of 75

- 117 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
beginning on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’ s death and ending
with the last monthly payment due prior to the beneficiary’ s death.
(iii)    50 percent Survivor Option : The Participant shall receive a reduced Pension payable
for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments in the amount of 50
percent of such reduced Pension shall be continued after the Participant’ s death to his beneficiary for
life, beginning on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’ s death and
ending with the last monthly payment due prior to the beneficiary’ s death. A 50 percent survivor option
under this paragraph shall be a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity if the Participant’ s beneficiary is his
Eligible Spouse.
(iv)    Ten Years Certain and Life Option : The Participant shall receive a reduced Pension
which shall be payable monthly for his lifetime but for not less than 120 months. If the retired Participant
dies before 120 payments have been made, the monthly Pension amount shall be paid for the
remainder of the 120 month period to the Participant’ s primary beneficiary (or if the primary beneficiary
has predeceased the Participant, the Participant’ s contingent beneficiary).
(3)    Single Lump Sum Payment Option : A Participant may receive payment of his Pension in the
form of a Single Lump Sum payment.
(4)    Combination Lump Sum/Monthly Benefit Option : A Participant who does not have an
Advance Election in ef fect may receive a portion of his Pension in
- 118 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
the form of a lump sum payment, and the remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits
described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above. The Pension is divided between the two forms of payment based
on the whole number percentages designated by the Participant on a form provided for this purpose by the
Plan Administrator . For the election to be ef fective, the sum of the two percentages designated by the
Participant must equal 100 percent.
(i)    The amount of the Pension paid in the form of a lump sum is determined by
multiplying: (A) the amount that would be payable to the Participant as a Single Lump Sum payment if
the Participant’ s entire benefit were payable in that form, by (B) the percentage that the Participant has
designated for receipt in the form of a lump sum.
(ii)    The amount of the Pension paid in the form of a monthly benefit is determined by
multiplying: (A) the amount of the monthly benefit elected by the Participant, determined in accordance
with paragraph (1) or (2) above (whichever applies), by (B) the percentage that the Participant has
designated for receipt in the form of a monthly benefit.
(b)    Inflation Protection : The following levels of inflation protection may be provided to any Participant
who is entitled to a Retirement Pension (except to the extent such Pension is paid as a lump sum).
(1)    5 percent Inflation Protection : A Participant’ s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced, but
thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 5 percent. The amount of the increase shall
be the dif ference between inflation in the prior year and 5 percent.
- 119 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
(2)    7 percent Inflation Protection : A Participant’ s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced, but
thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 7 percent. The amount of the increase shall
be the dif ference between inflation in the prior year and 7 percent.
Benefits shall be subject to increase in accordance with this subsection each January 1, beginning with the second
January 1 following the Participant’ s Annuity Starting Date. The amount of inflation in the prior year shall be
determined based on inflation in the 12 month period ending on September 30 of such year , with inflation measured
in the same manner as applies on January 1, 1989 for adjusting Social Security benefits for changes in the cost of
living. Inflation protection that is in ef fect shall carry over to any survivor benefit payable on behalf of a Participant,
and shall increase the otherwise applicable survivor benefit as provided above. Any election by a Participant to
receive inflation protection shall be irrevocable by such Participant or his surviving beneficiary .
(c)    Available Options for V ested Benefits : The forms of payment available for a Participant with a
Vested Pension are a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity for married Participants and a Single Life Annuity for both
married and unmarried Participants. The applicable form of payment shall be determined in accordance with Section
6.1(a).
6.3    Procedures for Elections : This section sets forth the procedures for making Advance Elections and PEP
Elections.
(a)    In General : To qualify as an Advance Election or PEP Election for purposes of Section 6.1, an

have an Advance Election in ef fect at such time.
(d)    Elections Rules for Annuity Starting Dates : When amounts become payable to a Participant in

- 122 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
with the following exception. In the case of a Participant who is rehired after his initial Annuity Starting Date and who
(i) is currently receiving an Annuity that remained in pay status upon rehire, or (ii) was previously paid a lump sum
distribution (other than a cashout distribution described in Section 4.9(a)), the Participant’ s subsequent Annuity
Starting Date (as a result of his termination of reemployment), and the election procedures at such subsequent
Annuity Starting Date, shall apply only to the portion of his benefit that accrues after his rehire. Any prior accruals that
remain to be paid as of the Participant’ s subsequent Annuity Starting Date shall continue to be payable in accordance

Section 6.2(a)(2) and the Participant or his beneficiary (beneficiaries in the case of Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv)) dies before
the PEP Election becomes ef fective, the election shall be disregarded. If the Participant dies after such PEP Election
becomes ef fective but before his Retirement Pension actually commences, the election shall be given ef fect and the
amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse or other beneficiary shall commence on the first day of the month
following his death (any back payments due the Participant shall be payable to his estate). In the case of a Participant
who has elected the form of payment described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), if such Participant dies: (i) after the PEP
Election has become ef fective, (ii)
- 123 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary , and (iii) before receiving 120 payments under the form of
payment, then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to the Participant’ s estate. If
payments have commenced under such form of payment to a Participant’ s primary or contingent beneficiary and
such beneficiary dies before payments are completed, then the remaining payments due under such form of payment
shall be paid to such beneficiary’ s estate.
(b)    Nonspouse Beneficiaries : If a Participant’ s beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse, he may not elect:
(1)    The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(i) if his nonspouse

is more than 19 years younger than he is.
6.5    Designation of Beneficiary : A Participant who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of

his death. Such designation shall be made on a PEP Election Form or an approved election form filed under the
Salaried Plan, whichever is applicable. In the case of the survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), the
Participant shall be entitled to name both a primary beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary . A Participant (whether
active or former) shall have the right to change or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to when his
election is finally ef fective. The designation of any beneficiary , and any change or revocation thereof, shall be made in
accordance with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator . A beneficiary designation shall not be ef fective unless and
until filed with the Plan Administrator (or for periods before the Ef fective Date, the Plan
- 124 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
Administrator under the Prior Plan). If no beneficiary is properly designated, then a Participant’ s election of a
survivor ’s option described in Section 6.2(a)(2) shall not be given ef fect.
APPENDIX
Foreword

A.1    1993 Accruals : This section shall apply to any individual: (i) who was a Salaried Plan Participant and
employed by the PBG Organization on December 31, 1993, (ii) whose Salaried Plan Pension was vested during 1993
(or would have become vested in 1994 if his Service after 1993 included the assumed period of continued service
specified in (a)(1) below), and (iii) whose minimum 1993 Pension in subsection (a) below is not derived solely from
that portion of the Plan described in (c) of Article X of the main portion of this Plan document. In determining the
amount of the 1993 and 1994 Pension amounts for any such individual, the provisions set forth in subsections (a) and
(b) below shall apply .
(a)    Minimum 1993 Pension : Any individual who is covered by this section shall accrue a minimum
1993 Pension as of December 31, 1993. In determining the amount of such individual’ s minimum 1993 Pension, the
following shall apply .

equal the respective Service and Credited Service he would have if
- 125 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program
his Service continued through December 31, 1994. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the assumed
period of continued Service shall be less to the extent PepsiCo, Inc.’ s human resource records on December
31, 1993 reflected a scheduled termination date in 1994 for such individual. In this case, the individual’ s
assumed period of continued service shall be the portion of 1994 that ends with such scheduled termination
date.
(2)    An individual’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings as of the end of 1993 shall be adjusted
by the actuary’ s salary scale assumption which is used under the Salaried Plan, so that they equal the amount
such scale projects for the individual as of the end of 1994. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
following special rules shall apply .
(i)    A higher salary scale assumption shall be used for anyone whose projected 1994
earnings as reflected on the “Special PEP Salary Scale” of the PBG Benefits Department on December
31, 1993 were higher than would be assumed under the first sentence of this paragraph. In this case,
the individual’ s 1993 earnings shall be adjusted using such higher salary scale.
(ii)    In the case of an individual whose assumed period of service under paragraph (1)
above is less than all of 1994, the salary adjustment under the preceding provisions of this paragraph
shall be reduced to the amount that would apply if the individual had no earnings after his scheduled
termination date.

Any individual who is covered by this section, and who is not otherwise vested as of December 31, 1993, shall
be vested as of such date in both his Pension (determined without regard to this subsection) and his minimum
1993 Pension. For purposes of this subsection, Code section 401(a)(17) shall be applied in 1993 by giving
effect to the amendments to such Code section made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Amendments of
1993.
(b)    Determination of Later Accruals : If a participant in the Salaried Plan accrues a minimum 1993
Pension under subsection (a) above, the amount of any Pre-409A Pension that accrues thereafter shall be only the
amount by which the Pre-409A Pension that would otherwise accrue for years after 1993 exceeds his minimum 1993
Pension under subsection (a).

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
ARTICLE I
Foreword
The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PepsiCo for the
benefit of salaried employees of the PepsiCo Organization who participate in the Salaried Plan. PEP provides
benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP provides benefits for certain eligible employees based
on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula (see, for example, Part B thereof).
1989 Restatement . The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety in 1989.
409A Program Document 2005 Restatement . The Plan was last amended and restated in its entirety
effective as of January 1, 2005. The 2005 restatement sets forth the terms of the Plan that are applicable to benefits
that are subject to Section 409A, i.e., generally , benefits that are earned or vested after December 31, 2004 or
materially modified within the meaning of T reas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4) (the “409A Program”).
Amendments to the 2005 Restatement . The 2005 restatement was amended to reflect the merger into
this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PBG PEP”), ef fective at the end of the day on December 31, 2011.
The PBG PEP document that was in ef fect on April 1, 2009, as amended through January 1, 2011 (the “409A PBG
PEP Document”) is attached hereto as Appendix Article PBG 409A and shall continue to govern PBG PEP benefits
that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger , except for certain administrative
provisions that are now governed by the main portion of the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document as is explained in
Appendix Article PBG 409A. There has been no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to
Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (“Section 409A”)
- 1 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP Documents as a result of the merger or the revisions to the 409A
PepsiCo PEP Document and 409A PBG PEP Document.
2017, 2019, and 2021 Restatements . This restatement of the 409A Program Document is ef fective as of
January 1, 2021. Before this restatement, the 409A Program Document was most recently restated ef fective as of
January 1, 2019 and prior to that, ef fective as of January 1, 2017.
Interplay of this 409A Program and Pre-409A Program . All benefits under the Plan that are not subject
to the 409A Program (i.e., generally , benefits that are earned or vested before January 1, 2005 and not materially
modified thereafter within the meaning of T reas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4)) shall be governed by the Plan Document for
the Pre-Section 409 Program (the “Pre-409A Program”). Together , this document and the document for the Pre-409A
Program describe the terms of a single plan. However , amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and
amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of
the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program
amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to be suf ficient to permit the pre-409A Program to remain
exempt from Section 409A as grandfathered benefits.    
    Freeze of the Salaried Plan . In general, the Plan provides benefits that make up for benefits that
would accrue under the Salaried Plan but for certain Code limitations on benefits and compensation that apply to the
Salaried Plan. As a result, a Participant’ s accrual of Plan benefits and a Participant’ s growing into certain benefit
enhancements (such as more favorable early commencement factors) are generally tied to the Participant’ s accrual
of benefits and growing into benefit enhancements under the Salaried Plan. For certain
- 2 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Participants, there are special provisions in Section 5.2 (the “PEP Guarantee”) or the Appendix that provide a benefit
accrual opportunity that goes beyond providing a make up for the application of Code limitations to the Salaried Plan.
Regardless, however , the freeze on accruals under the Salaried Plan that is ef fective as of the end of the day on
December 31, 2025 also freezes all accruals under this Plan ef fective as of that time. In addition, the Salaried Plan’ s
operational rules with respect to the ability to grow into benefit enhancements after December 31, 2025 govern the
ability to grow into benefit enhancements after December 31, 2025 under this Plan.

ARTICLE II
Definitions and Construction
2.1    Definitions : This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases listed below . Where the
following words and phrases, in boldface and underlined, appear in this Plan document (including the Foreword) with
initial capitals they shall have the meaning set forth below , unless a dif ferent meaning is plainly required by the
context.
Accrued Benefit : The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance
with Article V , based on the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Credited Service at the date
of determination.
Actuarial Equivalent : Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to
the Plan with respect to a specific benefit determination, a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of
the factors set forth below . The application of the following assumptions to the computation of benefits payable
under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner . In the event the Plan is amended to provide
new rights, features or benefits, the following actuarial factors shall not apply to these new elements unless
specifically adopted by the amendment.
(1)    Annuities and Inflation Protection : To determine the amount of a Pension payable in
the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or optional form of survivor annuity , as an annuity
with inflation protection, or as a period certain and life annuity , the Plan Administrator shall select the
factors that are to be used. Effective January 1, 2009, the factors selected by the Plan Administrator
are set forth in Schedule 1, below (prior
- 4 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
factors appear in the Appendix). Thereafter , the Plan Administrator shall review such factors for forms
of payment (including for annuities and lump sums) from time to time and shall amend such factors in
its discretion. In general, a Participant shall have no right to have any of the actuarial factors specified
for forms of payment under the Plan from time to time applied to his benefit (or any portion thereof),
except to the extent that a particular factor is currently in ef fect at the time it is to be applied under the
Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly intended and binding upon Participants that any
actuarial factors for forms of payment selected by the Plan Administrator from time-to-time may be
applied retroactively to already accrued benefits, and without regard to the actuarial factors that may
have applied previously for such purpose. However , in adjusting benefits under the Plan using those
factors in Schedule 1 (below) that become ef fective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1,
2019, the right to receive a benefit that is not less than would have applied under the prior basis for this
adjustment shall apply to the same extent (and in the same manner) as applies under the Salaried
Plan with respect to the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors. For this purpose, the phrase “2019 Salaried Plan
Factors” refers to the new factors that appear in the Salaried Plan’ s definition of “Actuarial Equivalent”
effective for annuity starting dates (as defined under the Salaried Plan) on or after January 1, 2019.
Effective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2019, if a Participant elects a survivor , period
certain annuity or other death benefit annuity with inflation protection, Schedule 1(b) shall apply to
adjust the Single Life Annuity for the survivor benefit, period certain or other
- 5 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
death benefit, and Schedule 1(c) or (d) shall apply solely to adjust for the elected inflation protection
(for this purpose and as applies generally when determining an Actuarial Equivalent, the adjustment
resulting from applying these factors from separate Schedules shall be determined using an actuarial
computation method that is reasonable and applied consistently to similarly situated participants).

(2)    Lump Sums : To determine the lump sum value of a Pension, a Pre-Retirement
Spouse’ s Pension under Section 4.6, or a Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension under Section
4.12, the lump sum equivalent factors currently applicable to lump sum distributions under the Salaried
Plan shall apply (disregarding transition factors). These factors are subject to change in accordance
with paragraph (1) above.
(3)    Other Cases : To determine the adjustment to be made in the Pension payable to or
on behalf of a Participant in other cases, the factors are those applicable for such purpose under the
Salaried Plan. In this respect, the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors shall be ef fective hereunder for Annuity
Starting Dates (as defined under this Plan) on or after January 1, 2019. These factors are subject to
change in accordance with paragraph (1) above.

March 31, 2010).
(3)    Rule of Administrative Convenience . Effective beginning with the December 31,

following calendar year (however , from the April 1, 2008 ef fective date through February 25, 2010,
Band IV and above applied in lieu of Leadership Group 6 and above); provided that if this would result
in counting more than 200 individuals as Key Employees as of any such determination date, then the
number treated as Key Employees will be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those
employees otherwise added by this paragraph (3) in order by their base compensation, from the lowest
to the highest.

combining the lists of Key Employees of all members of the PepsiCo Organization as in ef fect

method of identifying specified employees that complies with T reas. Reg. §§ 1.409A-1(i)(5) and -1(i)(8)
and Section VII.C.4.d of the Preamble to the Final Regulations under Section 409A of the Code, which
permits “service recipients to simply combine the pre-transaction separate lists of specified employees
where it is determined that such treatment would be administratively less burdensome.”
(5)    Identification of Key Employees from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2018 .
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the 12-month periodsst
- 13 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

(i)    For the period that begins on April 1, 2010, and ends on March 31, 2011, an
employee shall be a Key Employee (subject to subparagraph (iii) below) if he was classified as at
least a Band IV or its equivalent on December 31, 2009. For this purpose, an employee shall be
considered to be at least a Band IV or its equivalent as of a date if the employee is classified as
one of the following types of employees in the PepsiCo Organization on that date: (i) a Band IV

successor , by applying as of such
- 14 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
December 31 the default rules that apply under such regulation for determining the minimum
number of a service recipient’ s specified employees. If the preceding sentence and the methods
for identifying Key Employees set forth in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, taken together , would
result in more than 200 individuals being counted as Key Employees as of any December 31
determination date, then the number of individuals treated as Key Employees pursuant to
subparagraph (i) or (ii), who are not described in the first sentence of this subparagraph (iii), shall
be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those employees otherwise added by such
subparagraph in order of their base compensation, from the lowest base compensation to the
highest.

division of an employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company
classifies as part of the P AS business; “PBG Business” means each employer , division of an
employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part

and applied consistently with the rules applicable to such alternative arrangements.

- 23 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Plan H (“PERP-H”), as it may be amended from time to time, and as it was set forth prior to January 1, 2017 in

Section 409A : Section 409A of the Code.
Separation from Service : A Participant’ s separation from service with the PepsiCo
Organization, within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i). The term may also be used as a verb ( i.e.,
“Separates from Service”) with no change in meaning. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Participant’ s
transfer to an entity owned 20% or more by the Company will not constitute a Separation of Service to the
extent permitted by Section 409A. A Participant’ s “Final Separation from Service” is the date of his Separation
from Service that most recently precedes his Annuity Starting Date; provided, however , that to the extent a
Participant is reemployed after an Annuity Starting Date, he will have a new Final Separation from Service with
respect to any benefits to which he becomes entitled as a result of his reemployment. The following principles
shall generally apply in determining when a Separation from Service occurs:
(1)    A Participant separates from service with the Company if the Employee dies, retires,
or otherwise has a termination of employment with the Company . Whether a termination of
employment has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and circumstance indicate that the
Company and the Employee reasonably anticipated that no further services would be performed after a
certain date or that the level of bona fide services the Employee would perform after such date (as an
employee or independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the
average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding
- 24 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
36-month period (or the full period in which the Employee provided services to the Company if the
Employee has been providing services for less than 36 months).
(2)    An Employee will not be deemed to have experienced a Separation from Service if
such Employee is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence, to the extent such
leave does not exceed a period of six months or , if longer , such longer period of time during which a
right to re-employment is protected by either statute or contract. If the period of leave exceeds six
months and the individual does not retain a right to re-employment under an applicable statute or by
contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following
such six-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to any
medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be
expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six months, where such impairment causes the
Employee to be unable to perform the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially
similar position of employment, a 29-month period of absence may be substituted for such six-month
period.
(3)    If an Employee provides services both an as employee and as a member of the
Board of Directors of the Company , the services provided as a Director are generally not taken into
account in determining whether the Employee has Separated from Service as an Employee for
purposes of the Plan, in accordance with final regulations under Section 409A.

Equivalent of the Participant’ s 409A Pension as of the Participant’ s Early Retirement Date, in the case of a
Participant who is entitled to an immediate Early 409A Retirement Pension.
Social Security Act : The Social Security Act of the United States, as amended, an enactment
providing governmental benefits in connection with events such as old age, death and disability . Any reference
herein to the Social Security Act (or any of the benefits provided thereunder) shall be taken as a reference to

to the extent the Plan Administrator judges the computation of those benefits to be administratively feasible.
Taxable W age Base : The contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the
Social Security Act) in ef fect for the Plan Y ear.
Vested Pension : The Pension available to a Participant under Section 4.3. The term “409A

- 26 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
shall be used to refer to the portion of a V ested Pension that is derived from the Pre-409A Program.
2.2    Construction : The terms of the Plan shall be construed in accordance with this section.
(a)    Gender and Number : The masculine gender , where appearing in the Plan, shall be deemed
to include the feminine gender , and the singular may include the plural, unless the context clearly indicates to

(b)    Compounds of the W ord “Here” : The words “hereof”, “hereunder” and other similar
compounds of the word “here” shall mean and refer to the entire Plan, not to any particular provision or
section.
(c)    Examples : Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed
by a specific item or items, or there is a passage having a similar ef fect, such passages of the Plan shall be
construed as if the phrase “without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such
passage in a manner that avoids limits on its breadth of application).
(d)    Subdivisions of the Plan Document : This Plan document is divided and subdivided using
the following progression: articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses, and sub-
clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals. Sections are designated by Arabic numerals
containing a decimal point. Subsections are designated by lower-case letters in parentheses. Paragraphs are
designated by Arabic numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower-case roman numerals
in parentheses. Clauses are designated by upper-case letters in parentheses. Sub-clauses are designated by
upper-case roman numerals in
- 27 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

4.11    Forfeiture of Benefits : Effective beginning with benefits accrued after December 31, 2008 (“Post-
2008 Accruals”), and notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the Plan Administrator

Section 5.6).
(b)    Vested Employees : A Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s 409A Pension shall be payable

Partner , any Pension calculated for the Participant under Section 5.2(b) shall be reduced for each year such
coverage is in ef fect by the applicable percentage set forth below (based on the Participant’ s age at the time

ARTICLE V
Amount of Retirement Pension
When a 409A Pension becomes payable to or on behalf of a Participant under this Plan, the amount of
such 409A Pension shall be determined under Section 5.1 or 5.3 (whichever is applicable), subject to any
adjustments required under Sections 4.6(b) and 5.4 and subject to the freeze of the Plan described in Article I.
5.1    Participant’ s 409A Pension : Subject to Section 8.7 (Section 457A), a Participant’ s 409A Pension
shall be determined as follows –
(a)    Calculating the 409A Pension : A Participant’ s 409A Pension shall be calculated as follows
(on the basis specified in subsection (b) below and using the definitions appearing in subsection (c) below):
(1)    His T otal Pension, reduced by
(2)    His Salaried Plan Pension, and then further reduced by  (but not below zero)
(3)    His Pre-409A Pension.
(b)    Basis for Determining : The 409A Pension amount in subsection (a) above shall be
determined on a basis that (i) takes into account applicable reductions for early or late commencement as of
the Annuity Starting Date of the 409A Pension, (ii) reflects, if applicable and customary , the relative value of
forms of payment, and (iii) otherwise adjusts the reductions in (a)(2) and (3) above to their Actuarial
Equivalent, in each such respect as appropriate and customary under the circumstances and in accordance
with rules authorized by the Plan Administrator , including to take account the time and form of any prior
payments and to eliminate all duplication of benefits as
- 41 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
determined by the Plan Administrator , and (iii) ef fective for Annuity Starting Dates after December 31, 2018,
allows a Participant’ s 409A Pension to provide a makeup (as appropriate under the circumstances under rules
authorized by the Plan Administrator) for the application of early commencement reduction factors to the
Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension that apply a greater early commencement reduction to such Pre-409A Pension
than would apply under the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors (including with respect to any portion of the
Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension that is derived from the PEP Guarantee).
(c)    Definitions : The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1)    A Participant’ s “Total Pension” means the greater of:
(i)    The amount of the Participant’ s pension determined under the terms of Part B
of the Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and
415 of the Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and
(B) the actuarial adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of Part B of the Salaried Plan (relating to
benefits that are deferred beyond the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date); or
(ii)    The amount (if any) of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under
Section 5.2.
As necessary to ensure the Participant’ s receipt of a “greater of” benefit, the foregoing comparison shall
be made by reflecting, as applicable, the relative value of forms of payment.
- 42 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(2)    A Participant’ s “Salaried Plan Pension” means the amount of the Participant’ s
pension determined under the terms of Part B of the Salaried Plan.

earnings” means the Participant’ s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year , within the meaning of the Salaried
Plan as in ef fect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include remuneration from an entity
attributable to any period when that entity was not an Employer .
(b)    PEP Guarantee Formula : The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee shall be
determined under the applicable formula in paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).
(1)    Formulas : The amount of a Participant’ s Pension under this paragraph shall be
determined in accordance with subparagraph (i) below . However , if the Participant was actively
employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification eligible for the Salaried Plan prior to July 1,
1975, the amount of his Pension under this paragraph shall be the greater of the amounts
- 43 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
determined under subparagraphs (i) and (ii), provided that subparagraph (ii)(B) shall not apply in
determining the amount of a V ested Pension.
(i)    Formula A : The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be:
(A)    3 percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for the
first 10 years of Credited Service, plus
(B)    1 percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for
each year of Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less
(C)    1-2/3 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount
multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.
In determining the amount of a V ested Pension under this Formula A, the Pension shall first be
calculated on the basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he
remained in the employ of the Employer until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest
Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at his Separation from Service,
and then shall be reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Participant’ s actual years of Credited Service on his Separation from Service and the
denominator of which is the years of Credited Service he would have
- 44 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
earned had he remained in the employ of an Employer until his Normal Retirement Age.
(ii)    Formula B : The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be the greater
of (A) or (B) below:
(A)    1-1/2 percent of Highest A verage Monthly Earnings times the number
of years of Credited Service, less 50 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security
Amount, or
(B)    3 percent of Highest A verage Monthly Earnings times the number of
years of Credited Service up to 15 years, less 50 percent of the Participant’ s Primary
Social Security Amount.
In determining the amount of a Disability Pension under Formula A or B above, the Pension shall be
calculated on the basis of the Participant’ s Credited Service (determined in accordance with
Section 3.3(c)(3) of Part B of the Salaried Plan), and his Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and
Primary Social Security Amount at the date of disability .
(2)    Calculation : The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to
paragraph (1) above, subject to the following special rules:
(i)    Surviving Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Annuity :    Subject to
subparagraph (iii) below and the last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , the Participant’ s Eligible Spouse or Eligible
- 45 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Domestic Partner shall be entitled to receive a survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the
Participant’ s Annuity under this section, with no corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the
Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall
begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’ s death and shall
end with the last monthly payment due prior to the Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic
Partner ’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is more than 10 years
younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable under this subparagraph shall be
adjusted as provided below .
(A)    For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor
benefit payable to such Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by
0.8 percent.
(B)    For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or
Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to
such Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by an additional 0.4
percent.
(ii)    Reductions : The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’ s
PEP Guarantee.
- 46 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(A)    If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment
amount shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit
commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal
Retirement Date.
(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment amount
shall be reduced to the actuarial equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal
Retirement Date (if payment commences before such date), and the Section 4.6(b)
reductions for any Pre Retirement Spouse’ s coverage and Section 4.12(b) reductions for
any Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s coverage shall apply .
(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form
that provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the
life of the surviving Eligible Spouse or surviving Eligible Domestic Partner , that is greater
than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’ s Pension
under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the
Participant’ s behalf is the actuarial equivalent of the Pension otherwise payable under the
foregoing provisions of this section.
(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form
that provides a survivor annuity for a
- 47 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner . In this instance,
the Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the
benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the actuarial equivalent of a Single Life
Annuity for the Participant’ s life.
(E)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in an
Annuity form that includes inflation protection described in Section 6.2(b). In this instance,
the Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the
benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the actuarial equivalent of the elected
Annuity without such protection.
(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion : The amount of the Retirement Pension determined
under this section for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a
lump sum shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under
this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above
and any early retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
For purposes of this paragraph (2), actuarial equivalence shall be determined taking into account the
PEP Guarantee’ s purpose to preserve substantially the value of a benefit under the pre-1989 terms of
the Plan and the 409A Plan’ s design that of fers alternative annuities that are considered actuarial
equivalent
- 48 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
for purposes of Section 409A (taking into account, without limitation, the special rule for subsidized joint
and survivor annuities in T reasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(b)(ii)(C)).
5.3    Amount of Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s 409A Pension : The monthly amount of the Pre-Retirement
Spouse’ s 409A Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse under Section 4.6 shall be determined under
subsection (a) below .
(a)    Calculation : An Eligible Spouse’ s Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s 409A Pension shall be equal to:
(1)    The Eligible Spouse’ s Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension, reduced by
(2)    The Eligible Spouse’ s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension, and then
further reduced by  (but not below zero)
(3)    The Eligible Spouse’ s Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension derived from the Pre-409A
Program.
(b)    Basis for Determining : The Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s 409A Pension amount in subsection
(a) above shall be determined on a basis (i) that takes into account applicable reductions for early or late
commencement, and (ii) otherwise adjusts the reductions in (a)(2) and (3) above to their Actuarial Equivalent
as appropriate under the circumstances and pursuant to rules of the Plan Administrator , including to take
account the time and form of any prior payments.

(i)    The amount of the Eligible Spouse’ s pre-retirement spouse’ s pension
determined under the terms of Part B of the Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the
limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such limitations are
interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial adjustment under
Section 5.7(d) of Part B of the Salaried Plan; or
(ii)    The amount (if any) of the Eligible Spouse’ s PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement
Spouse’ s Pension determined under subsection (c).
In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated as if
payable as of what would be the Normal Retirement Date of the Participant related to the Eligible
Spouse. The greater benefit determined under the prior sentence shall then be reduced/increased for
commencement before/after , as applicable, such Normal Retirement Date.
(2)    An “Eligible Spouse’ s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension” means the

Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below ,
whichever is applicable, with reference to the PEP Guarantee (if any) that would have been available to the
Participant under
Section 5.2.
(1)    Normal Rule : The Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension payable under this paragraph
shall be equal to the amount that would be payable as a survivor annuity , under a Qualified Joint and
Survivor Annuity , if the Participant had:
(i)    Separated from Service on the date of death (or , if earlier , his actual
Separation from Service);
(ii)    Commenced a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the same date
payments of the Qualified Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension are to commence; and
(iii)    Died on the day immediately following such commencement.
(2)    Special Rule for Active and Disabled Employees : Notwithstanding paragraph (1)
above, the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension paid on behalf of a Participant described in
Section 4.6(a) shall not be less than an amount equal to 25 percent of such Participant’ s PEP
Guarantee determined under Section 5.2. For this purpose, Credited Service shall be determined as
provided in Section 3.3(c)(2) of Part B the Salaried Plan, and the deceased Participant’ s Highest

apply in determining the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s 409A Pension under this section.

(a)    Adjustments for Rehired Participants : This subsection shall apply to a current or former
Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is
recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service. In the event of any such recalculation, the
Participant’ s PEP Pension shall also be recalculated hereunder to the maximum extent permissible under
Section 409A. For this purpose and to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A, the PEP
Guarantee under Section 5.2 is adjusted for in-service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner
as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any
specified plans.
(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans : If the benefit paid under a specified
plan on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether
the increase is by order of a
- 52 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), then the PEP benefit for the
Participant shall be recalculated to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A. If the recalculation
identifies an overpayment hereunder , the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to
recover the overpayment. It is specifically intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this
Plan and any specified plans to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A.
(c)    No Benefit Of fsets That W ould V iolate Section 409A . Effective as of January 1, 2009, if a
Participant has earned a benefit under a plan maintained by a member of the PepsiCo Organization that is a
“qualifying plan” for purposes of the “Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.8 of Part A of the Salaried Plan and the
“Transfers and Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.5 of Part B of the Salaried Plan, such T ransfers and Non-
Duplication rules shall apply when calculating the Participant’ s Total Pension under Section 5.1(c)(1) above
only to the extent the application of such rule to the Participant’ s 409A Pension will not result in a change in
the time or form of payment of such pension that is prohibited by Section 409A. For purposes of the limit on
offsets in the preceding sentence, it is the Company’ s intent to undertake to make special arrangements with
respect to the payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally permissible under the qualifying
plan and compliant with Section 409A, in order to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the
maximum extent possible; to the extent that Section 409A compliant special arrangements are timely put into
effect in a particular situation, the limit on of fsets in the prior sentence will not apply .

5.5    Excludable Employment : An executive who has signed a written agreement with the Company
pursuant to which the individual either (i) waives eligibility under the Plan (even if the individual otherwise meets the
definition of Employee under the Plan), or (ii) agrees not to participate in the Plan, shall not thereafter become entitled
to a benefit or to any increase in benefits in connection with such employment (whichever applies). Written
agreements may be entered into either before or after the executive becomes eligible for or begins participation in the
Plan, and such written agreement may take any form that is deemed ef fective by the Company . This Section 5.5 shall
apply with respect to agreements that are entered into on or after January 1, 2009.
5.6    Pre-409A Pension : A Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension is the portion of the Participant’ s Pension
that is grandfathered under T reasury Regulation § 1.409A-6(a)(3)(i) and (iv). Principles similar to those applicable
under – (i) Section 5.1(b), and (ii) the last sentence of Section 5.2(b)(2) shall apply in determining the Pre-409A
Pension under this section.
5.7    Offsets : Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company may reduce the amount of
any payment or benefit that is or would be payable to or on behalf of a Participant by the amount of any obligation of
the Participant to the Company that is or becomes due and payable, provided that (1) the obligation of the Participant
to the Company was incurred during the employment relationship, (2) the reduction during any Plan Y ear may not
exceed the amount allowed under Code Section 409A and (3) the reduction is made at the same time and in the
same amount as the obligation otherwise would have been due and collectable from the Participant. In addition, in
the event a Participant has earned a 409A Benefit (a “Prior 409A Benefit”) that was paid before, or will become
payable either before or under dif ferent payment terms than, an additional 409A Benefit for the Participant, the
- 54 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
calculation of the Participant’ s additional 409A Benefit shall include an of fset for the Prior 409A Benefit. This of fset
shall be determined as of the Annuity Starting Date of the additional 409A Benefit on a basis that (i) takes into
account applicable reductions for early or late commencement as of the Annuity Starting Date of the additional 409A
Pension, (ii) reflects, if applicable and customary , the relative value of forms of payment, and (iii) otherwise adjusts
the of fset to its Actuarial Equivalent, in each such respect as appropriate and customary under the circumstances and
in accordance with rules authorized by the Plan Administrator . Therefore, by way of example, but not by way of
limitation, when pursuant to Section 4.5 a Participant is entitled to Post-Disability Accruals after having become
entitled to Pre-Separation Accruals, such an of fset of the Pre-Separation Accruals will apply in determining the Post-
Disability Accruals.
5.8    Amount of Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension : The monthly amount of the Pre-
Retirement Domestic Partner ’s 409A Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Domestic Partner under Section 4.12
shall be determined under subsection (a) below .
(a)    Calculation : An Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s 409A
Pension shall be equal to:
(1)    The Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Total Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension,

Pension, and then further reduced by  (but not below zero)
(3)    The Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension derived

- 55 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

or late commencement, and (ii) otherwise adjusts the reductions in (a)(2) and (3) above to their Actuarial
Equivalent as appropriate under the circumstances and pursuant to rules of the Plan Administrator , including to
take account the time and form of any prior payments.

6.4    Special Rules for Survivor Options : The following special rules shall apply for the survivor options

Amount and any related income tax withholding shall be paid from the Participant’ s 409A Pension and remitted
to the IRS (or other applicable tax authority) in satisfaction of such FICA Amount and income tax withholding
related to such FICA Amount. The classification of a Participant as a Key Employee (as defined in Section 2.1)
shall have no ef fect on the timing of the lump sum payment under this subsection (a).
(b)    Reduction of 409A Pension . To reflect the payment of a Participant’ s FICA Amount and any
related income tax liability , the Participant’ s 409A Pension shall be reduced, ef fective as of the date for
payment of the lump sum in accordance with subsection (a) above, with such reduction being the Actuarial
Equivalent of the lump sum payment used to satisfy the Participant’ s FICA Amount and related income tax
withholding. It is expressly contemplated that this reduction may

(A)    No Ef fect on Commencement of 409A Pension . The Participant’ s 409A Pension shall
commence in accordance with the terms of this Plan. The lump sum payment to satisfy the Participant’ s

ARTICLE VII
Administration
7.1    Authority to Administer Plan : The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator , which shall have
the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as it deems appropriate. The Plan Administrator shall
maintain Plan records and make benefit calculations, and may rely upon information furnished it by the Participant in
writing, including the Participant’ s current mailing address, age and marital status. The Plan Administrator ’s
interpretations, determinations, regulations and calculations shall be final and binding on all persons and parties
concerned. Neither the Company nor the Plan Administrator shall be a fiduciary of the Plan, and any restrictions that
might apply to a party in interest under section 406 of ERISA shall not apply under the Plan, including with respect to
the Company or the Plan Administrator .
7.2    Facility of Payment : Whenever , in the Plan Administrator ’s opinion, a person entitled to receive
any payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so
as to be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the Plan Administrator may make payments to such person or to the
legal representative of such person for his benefit, or the Plan Administrator may apply the payment for the benefit of
such person in such manner as it considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance
with the provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under
the provisions of the Plan.
7.3    Claims Procedure : The Plan Administrator shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to
construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of
such benefits, and its decisions on such matters
- 73 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
are final and conclusive. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its
discretion that the person claiming such benefits is entitled to them. This discretionary authority is intended to be
absolute, and in any case where the extent of this discretion is in question, the Plan Administrator is to be accorded
the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court, arbitrator
or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the abuse of discretion standard). If, pursuant to this
discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Participant or beneficiary (a
“claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator , or a party designated by the Plan Administrator , will
provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the Plan Administrator , a
comprehensible written notice setting forth:
(a)    The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
(b)    Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(c)    A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit
to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
(d)    A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to
such process and a statement of the claimant’ s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following a further
denial on review).
If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim
it may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant
before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating
- 74 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan Committee expects to make the
final decision. The claim review procedure is available upon written request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator ,
or the designated party , within 60 days after receipt by the claimant of written notice of the denial of the claim. Upon
review , the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim, including the opportunity to
submit to the Plan Administrator comments, document, records and other information relevant to the claim and the
Plan Administrator ’s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless
of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made within 60
days after receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an
additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial
60-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan
Administrator expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner
calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with references to the specific
Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request ad
free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his or
her claim for benefits.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed
solely on the basis of the record before the Plan Administrator at the time it made its determination. In addition, any
such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this section as is more fully
explained in Section 7.5. Any notice or other notification that is required to be sent to a claimant under this
- 75 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
section may be sent pursuant to any method approved under Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1
or other applicable guidance.
7.4    Effect of Specific References : Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator ’s discretion
shall create no inference that the Plan Administrator ’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other
provision, is less complete or broad.
7.5    Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’ s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court:  Before filing any
Claim (including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the
Claimant’ s rights under the claims procedures of Section 7.3.
(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 is
intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps
necessary to clarify or ef fect this intent may be taken).
(b)    In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion
of the Plan’ s claims procedure as described in this Section 7.5, the subsequent action or consideration shall be
limited, to the maximum extent permissible, to the record that was before Plan Administrator in the claims
procedure.
(c)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other
Disputes that are not Claims (including those that a court might consider at the same time) are of greater
significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Plan Administrator may choose to provide in connection with
novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential and (iv)
even if the Plan Administrator has not previously defined or established specific
- 76 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
claims procedures that directly apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the
Plan Administrator (upon notice of the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall
apply (or act by analogy to) the claims procedures of Section 7.5 that apply to claims for benefits).
(d)    The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class
basis or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be
made as are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.
(e)    For purposes of this Section 7.5, the following definitions apply .
(i)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, action or other matter .
(ii)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of
the following –
(A)    The interpretation of the Plan
(B)    The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan
(C)    The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light
of applicable law;
(D)    Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been
validly adopted or put into ef fect;
(E)    The administration of the Plan;
(F)    Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms,
conditions or requirements of ERISA or other
- 77 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
applicable law or regulation, regardless of whether such terms, conditions or requirements
are, in whole or in part, incorporated into the terms, conditions or requirements of the
Plan;
(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;
(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any fiduciary
duty; or
(I)    Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the Plan
Administrator , or (ii) relates to the Plan in any way .
(iii)    A “Claimant” is any Employee, former Employee, Participant, former
Participant, Beneficiary (or the spouse, former spouse, domestic partner , estate, heir or
representative of any of the foregoing individuals), or any other individual, person, entity with a
relationship to any of the foregoing individuals or the Plan, as well as any group of one or more of
the foregoing, who has a Claim.
7.6    Limitations on Actions : Effective for claims and actions filed on or after January 1, 2011, any claim
filed under Article VII and any action filed in state or federal court by or on behalf of a former or current Employee,
Participant, beneficiary or any other individual, person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful
denial of Plan benefits or for the alleged interference with or violation of ERISA-protected rights must be brought
within two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of
action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be
- 78 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
deemed to accrue not later than the earliest of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that
are the subject of the claim or legal action (ii) the date identified to the Petitioner by the Plan Administrator on which
payments shall commence, or (iii) when the Petitioner has actual or constructive knowledge of the facts that are the
basis of his claim. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to the alleged interference with
ERISA-protected rights shall be deemed to accrue when the claimant has actual or constructive knowledge of the
acts that are alleged to interfere with ERISA-protected rights. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within
this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or
cause of action. Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals process described in
Section 7.3 shall have no ef fect on this two-year time frame.
7.7    Restriction on V enue : Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the
Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner (as defined in Section 7.6 above) shall only be brought or filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New Y ork, ef fective for claims or actions filed on or after January 1,

ARTICLE VIII
Miscellaneous
8.1    Nonguarantee of Employment : Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of
employment between an Employer and any Employee, or as a right of any Employee to be continued in the
employment of an Employer , or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its Employees, with or
without cause.
8.2    Nonalienation of Benefits : Benefits payable under the Plan or the right to receive future benefits
under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer , assignment, pledge,
encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution, or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary , and any attempt to
anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer , assign, pledge, encumber , charge or otherwise dispose of any right to benefits
payable hereunder , including any assignment or alienation in connection with a divorce, separation, child support or
similar arrangement, shall be null and void and not binding on the Company . The Company shall not in any manner
be liable for , or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits
hereunder .
8.3    Unfunded Plan : The Company’ s obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall
constitute liabilities by the Company payable when due out of the Company’ s general funds. To the extent the
Participant or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than
the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Company .
8.4    Action by the Company : Any action by the Company under this Plan may be made by the Board of
Directors of the Company or by the Compensation Committee of the
- 80 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Board of Directors, with a report of any actions taken by it to the Board of Directors. In addition, such action may be
made by any other person or persons duly authorized by resolution of said Board to take such action.
8.5    Indemnification : Unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine otherwise, the
Company shall indemnify , to the full extent permitted by law , any employee acting in good faith within the scope of his
employment in carrying out the administration of the Plan.
8.6    Compliance with Section 409A :
(a)    General : It is the intention of the Company that the Plan shall be construed in accordance
with the applicable requirements of Section 409A. Further , in the event that the Plan shall be deemed not to
comply with Section 409A, then neither the Company , the Board of Directors, the Plan Administrator nor its or
their designees or agents shall be liable to any Participant or other person for actions, decisions or
determinations made in good faith.
(b)    Non-duplication of benefits : In the interest of clarity , and to determine benefits in compliance
with the requirements of Section 409A, provisions have been included in this 409A Document describing the
calculation of benefits under certain specific circumstances, for example, provisions relating to the inclusion of
salary continuation during certain window severance programs in the calculation of Highest A verage Monthly
Earnings, as specified in Appendix B. Notwithstanding this or any similar provision, no duplication of benefits
may at any time occur under the Plan. Therefore, to the extent that a specific provision of the Plan provides for
recognizing a benefit determining element (such as pensionable earnings or service) and this same
- 81 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
element is or could be recognized in some other way under the Plan, the specific provision of the Plan shall
govern and there shall be absolutely no duplicate recognition of such element under any other provision of the
Plan, or pursuant to the Plan’ s integration with the Salaried Plan. This provision shall govern over any contrary
provision of the Plan that might be interpreted to support duplication of benefits.
8.7    Section 457A : To avoid the application of Code section 457A (“Section 457A”) to a Participant’ s
Pension, the following shall apply to a Participant who transfers to a work location outside of the United States to

through entity that is wholly owned by a United States corporation (“Covered T ransfer”):
(a)    The Participant shall automatically vest in his or her Pension as of the last business day
before the Covered T ransfer;
(b)    From and after the Covered T ransfer , any benefit accruals or other increases or
enhancements to the Participant’ s Pension relating to –
(1)    Service, or
(2)    The attainment of a specified age while in the employment of the PepsiCo
Organization (“age attainment”),
(collectively , “Benefit Enhancement”) will not be credited to the Participant until the last day of the Plan Y ear in
which the Participant renders the Service or has the age attainment that results in such Benefit Enhancement,
and then only to the extent permissible under subsection (c) below at that time; and
(c)    The Participant shall have no legal right to (and the Participant shall not receive) any Benefit
Enhancement that relates to Service or age attainment
- 82 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
from and after the Covered T ransfer to the extent such Benefit Enhancement would constitute compensation
that is includable in income under Section 457A.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsection (a) above shall not apply to a Participant who has a Covered T ransfer if,
prior to the Covered T ransfer , the Company provides a written communication (either to the Participant individually , to
a group of similar Participants, to Participants generally , or in any other way that causes the communication to apply
to the Participant – i.e., an “applicable communication”) that these subsections do not apply to the Covered T ransfer
in question. Subsection (b) shall cease to apply as of the earlier of – (i) the date the Participant returns to service for a
member of the PepsiCo Organization that is a United States corporation or a pass-through entity that is wholly owned
by a United States corporation, or (ii) the ef fective date for such cessation that is stated in an applicable
communication.
8.8    Authorized T ransfers : If a Participant transfers to an entity that is not part of the PepsiCo
Organization, the liability for any benefits accrued while the Participant was employed by the PepsiCo Organization
shall remain with the Company .

indefinitely , they assume no contractual obligation as to its continuance. In accordance with Section 8.4, the

409A Program.

ERISA Plan Structure
This Plan document in conjunction with the plan document(s) for the Pre-409A Program encompasses
three separate plans within the meaning of ERISA, as are set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c). This division into
separate plans became ef fective as of July 1, 1996; previously the plans set forth in subsections (b) and (c) were a
single plan within the meaning of ERISA.
(a)    Excess Benefit Plan : An excess benefit plan within the meaning of section 3(36) of ERISA,
maintained solely for the purpose of providing benefits for Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations
on benefits imposed by section 415 of the Code.
(b)    Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan : A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the
purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees within the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. The plan provides benefits for
Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations imposed by section 401(a)(17) of the Code on benefits
under the Salaried Plan (after taking into account any benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan). For ERISA
reporting purposes, this portion of PEP may be referred to as the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan I.
(c)    Preservation T op Hat Plan : A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the purpose of
providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within
the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. The plan provides preserves benefits for those

was in ef fect before the Salaried Plan’ s amendment ef fective January 1, 1989 (after taking into account any
benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan and Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan). For ERISA reporting
purposes, this portion of PEP shall be referred to as the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan II.
Benefits under this Plan shall be allocated first to the Excess Benefit Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the
purpose indicated in (a) above; then any remaining benefits shall be allocated to the Excess Compensation T op Hat
Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the purpose indicated in (b) above; then any remaining benefits shall be
allocated to the Preservation T op Hat Plan. These three plans are severable for any and all purposes as directed by
the Company .
In addition to the above, to the extent that lump sum termination benefits are paid under this Plan in
connection with a severed employee’ s Special Early Retirement (as defined in Appendix Article D) under a temporary
severance program sponsored by the Company , this portion of the Plan shall be a component of the Company’ s
unfunded severance plan that includes the temporary program of severance benefits in question. As a component of
a severance plan, the lump sum termination benefits are welfare benefits, and this portion is part of a “welfare benefit
plan” under ERISA section 3(1). This severance plan component shall exist solely (i) for the duration of the temporary
severance program in question, and (ii) for the purpose of paying severance benefits. As a portion of an ERISA
welfare plan, any such temporary severance benefits hereunder shall not be subject to the reporting requirements for
top hat plans under ERISA or any of the ERISA requirements for pension plans.

- 91 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(2)    Operating Rules for 2006 and 2007 . To ensure that the Company did not fail to identify any
Key Employees, in the case of Separation from Service distributions during the 2006 Plan Y ear and
2007 Plan Y ear, the Company treated as Key Employees for such applicable Plan Y ear of their
Separation from Service those individuals who met the provisions of (3) or (4) below (or both).
(3)    The Company shall treat as Key Employees all Participants (and former Participants) who

Year of their Separation from Service; and
(4)    The Company shall treat as a Key Employee any Participant who would be a Key Employee

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

A.3    Transition Rules for Article VI (Distributions) :

A.4    Transition Rules for Article VII (Administration) :
Effective during the T ransition Period, the language of Section 8.6(a) shall be replaced in its entirety with the
following language:
“8.6(a)    Compliance with Section 409A :
At all times during each Plan Y ear, this Plan shall be operated (i) in accordance with the requirements of
Section 409A, and (ii) to preserve the status of deferrals under the Pre-409A Program as being exempt from
Section 409A, i.e., to preserve the grandfathered status of the Pre-409A Program. Any action that may be
taken (and, to the extent possible, any action actually taken) by the Plan Administrator or the Company shall
not be taken (or shall be void and without ef fect), if such action violates the requirements of Section 409A or if
such action would adversely af fect the grandfather of the Pre-409A Program. If the failure to take an action
under the Plan would violate Section 409A, then to the extent it is possible thereby to avoid a violation of
Section 409A, the rights and ef fects under the Plan shall be altered to avoid such violation. A corresponding
rule shall apply with respect to a failure to take an action that would adversely af fect the grandfather of the Pre-
409A Program. Any provision in this Plan
- 93 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
document that is determined to violate the requirements of Section 409A or to adversely af fect the grandfather
of the Pre-409A Program shall be void and without ef fect. In addition, any provision that is required to appear

(g)    The “PIRP-DB V ice President” is the Company executive who has the role of the “V ice President”
under the terms of PIRP-DB.
(h)    A “U.S. Person” is an individual who is classified as a “U.S. Person” under the terms of PIRP-DB.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(i)    “Y ear of T ransfer” is the year in which a transfer described in subsection (f) above occurs.
C.5    Benefit Formula for PIRP T ransfer Participants :
Except as provided in this Section C.5, a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under the Plan shall be
determined using a calculation methodology that is substantially similar to that which applies under Section 5.1 of the
Plan.
(a)    Total Pension for PIRP T ransfer Participant : Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a PIRP
Transfer Participant’ s “Total Pension” (as defined in Section 5.1(c)(1) of the Plan) shall be calculated as
provided in paragraphs (1) and (2) below .
(1)    First, a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Total Pension shall be calculated as if he were an
eligible employee under the Salaried Plan for the entire Y ear of T ransfer , and as if he received Credited
Service and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Y ear of T ransfer equal to – (i) his actual Credited
Service and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Y ear of T ransfer , increased by  (ii) any other
compensation and service for the Y ear of T ransfer that would have been recognized as PIRP-DB Salary
and PIRP DB Pensionable Service, if Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB did not apply for the Y ear of T ransfer .
(2)    If (during a year a PIRP T ransfer Participant is otherwise accruing benefits under this Plan)
the PIRP T ransfer Participant would be credited with PIRP-DB Salary that cannot be recognized under
PIRP as a result of Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB, and if this PIRP-DB Salary would be considered for
accrual purposes under PIRP-DB in connection with PIRP-DB Pensionable Service that is not
recognized under this Plan, the increase in the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s
- 114 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Accrued Benefit under PIRP that is related to this PIRP-DB Pensionable Service and that is blocked by
Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB shall be added to the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Accrued Benefit under this
Plan. In the case of a PIRP T ransfer Participant who has a Separation from Service on or after January
1, 2017, this increase in the PIRP T ransfers Participant’ s Accrued Benefit under this Plan shall result in
an appropriate increase, determined in the Company’ s discretion, in the T otal Pension determined
under paragraph (1) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining Credited Service and
Earnings under this subsection (a), no compensation or service shall be taken into account more than
once, and a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Total Pension shall be determined in a way that avoids any
duplication of benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP T ransfer Participant under PIRP-
DB (after applying Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or contributed to by the
Company or an af filiate, but without applying any of fset that would violate Code Section 409A.
(b)    Calculation of PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Benefit : The PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under
the Plan shall be calculated by reducing his T otal Pension as determined under subsection (a) above by the
reductions that are normally applicable under Article V . In addition, in the case of a PIRP T ransfer Participant
who has a Separation from Service on or after January 1, 2017, if (during a year a PIRP T ransfer Participant is
otherwise accruing benefits under this Plan) the value of the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under PIRP-
DB would increase (if Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB did not apply) as a result of the PIRP T ransfer Participant
becoming eligible for early retirement
- 115 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
under PIRP-DB, then the projected increase in value of the PIRP-DB benefit at the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s
retirement under PIRP-DB, which will be blocked by Section 9.14 of PIRP , shall result in an appropriate
increase, determined in the Company’ s discretion, in the Participant’ s benefit under this Plan that is payable at
the time and in the form applicable under this Plan. The appropriate increase shall be determined net of any
expected increase in the value of the benefit under this Plan related to becoming eligible for Early Retirement
under this Plan. In addition, a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s appropriate increase shall be determined in a way
that avoids any duplication of benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP T ransfer Participant
under PIRP-DB (after applying Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or contributed to by the
Company or an af filiate, but without applying any of fset that would violate Code Section 409A.
C.6    Alternative Arrangements Permitted :
Notwithstanding any provision of this Article or the Plan to the contrary , the Company and a Participant who
would qualify as an International T ransfer Participant under Section C.2 above may agree in writing to disregard the
provisions of this Article in favor of another mutually agreed upon benefit arrangement under the Plan that complies
with Code Section 409A, in which case this Article shall not apply .

APPENDIX ARTICLE D
Band 4 or Higher Rehired Y um Participants
D.1    Scope:
Effective May 1, 2009, this Article provides special rules for calculating the benefit of a transferred Participant
whose transfer would be an Eligible T ransfer under Section TRI.2(e) of the Part B of the Salaried Plan but for the fact
that such individual is reemployed by the Company on or after May 1, 2009, into a position that is classified as Band
4 (or its equivalent) or higher . For purposes of determining such Participant’ s Total Pension within the meaning of
Section 5.1(c)(1), but not for purposes of determining such Participant’ s Salaried Plan Pension within the meaning of
Section 5.1(c)(2), such Participant’ s position on reemployment will be deemed to be classified as below Band 4 (or its
equivalent), so that the Participant’ s transfer is eligible to be treated as an Eligible T ransfer (subject to the other
conditions thereof) and the Participant is eligible for the imputed service provisions of Section TRI.4(b) and (c). Such
Participant’ s benefit otherwise shall be subject to the Plan’ s usual conditions and shall be paid in accordance with the
Plan’ s usual terms. All benefits paid under this Article are subject to Code section 409A.

APPENDIX ARTICLE F -
U.K. Supplementary Appendix Participants with U.S. Service
F.1    Scope:
This Article applies to “Covered U.K. Employees” as defined in Section F .2 below . The benefit of a Covered
U.K. Employee shall be determined as provided in Section F .3 below . Once a benefit is determined for a Covered
U.K. Employee under this Article, it shall be paid in accordance with the Plan’ s normal terms regarding the time and
form of payment. All benefits payable under this Article are subject to Code section 409A. This Article has been
restated ef fective January 1, 2016 (the original version of this Article was ef fective January 1, 2011, and it applied, in
accordance with its prior terms, to periods of service before January 1, 2016).
F.2    “Covered U.K. Employee” Defined :
A “Covered U.K. Employee” is a participant in the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (“U.K. Participant”) who – (i)
becomes subject to United States income taxes, e.g., by transferring to a position with the Company in the United
States or otherwise (hereinafter referenced as “Engages in U.S. Service”), (ii) continues to accrue benefits under the
PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan after he Engages in U.S. Service, (iii) would have also accrued a benefit under the U.K.
Supplementary Pension Appendix for such period following when he Engages in U.S. Service (except for the
unavailability of accruals under such Appendix for the period a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service), (iv)
subsequently either – (A) is localized in the United States as an employee of the PepsiCo Organization, or (B)
terminates employment with the PepsiCo Organization (provided this occurs before the date the U.K. Participant
commences an assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States, as defined
- 124 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
in the Code), and (v) only after fully satisfying all of the preceding clauses, is then designated by the Company (in its
completely unfettered discretion) as a Covered U.K. Employee and thereby granted a legally binding right to a benefit
under this Article F at the time of the designation. The period that a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service shall
begin on the first day that he becomes subject to United States income taxes (his “U.S. Commencement Date”), and
it shall end on the date he is no longer subject to U.S. income taxes or , if earlier , the date his Plan benefits under this
Article F commence (his “U.S. Cessation Date”).
F.3    Benefit for Covered U.K. Employees :
A Covered U.K. Employee’ s benefit under the Plan shall be determined by calculating, as of his Modified U.S.
Cessation Date, his “T otal U.K. Supplementary Benefit” and then subtracting from this amount his “Frozen U.K.
Supplementary Benefit.” For this purpose, a Covered U.K. Employee’ s—
(a)    “Modified U.S. Cessation Date” is the earliest of the following – (i) the date he is no longer subject
to U.S. income taxes, (ii) the date he first satisfies clause (iv) of Section F .2, (iii) the date he commences an
assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States (as defined in the Code),
or (iv) the date his Plan benefits under this Article F commence.
(b)    “T otal U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he would have under the terms
of the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix, calculated based on all service and compensation with the
Company through his Modified U.S. Cessation Date that is counted in the calculation of his benefit under the
PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (or that would be counted but for a limitation applicable to the plan under
- 125 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
U.K. law), and with such total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date
his benefits under this Article F commence, and
(c)    “Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he had under the terms of the
U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date, and with such
total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date his benefits under this
Article F commence.
The calculation provided for in the preceding sentence shall be made in accordance with the operating rules set forth
in Section F .4 below .
F.4    Operating Rules:
The following operating rules apply to the calculation in Section F .3. above.
(a)    In general, accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K.
Employee’ s U.S. Cessation Date shall not reduce the benefit under this Article F determined under Section
F.3. Notwithstanding the prior sentence and anything in Section F .3 to the contrary , to the extent a Covered
U.K. Employee’ s accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K.
Employee’ s U.S. Cessation Date have more than fully of fset the Covered U.K. Employee’ s accruals under the
U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix (and the excess would have been of fset against the benefit under this
Article F had such benefit accrued under the U.K. Supplementary Appendix), then any such excess as of the
date benefits under this Article F commence (expressed as a lump sum as of such date) shall be of fset against
the benefits under this Article F to the extent such of fset would not violate Code Section 409A.
- 126 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(b)    In determining the value of a lump sum under this Article F , the actuarial assumptions that are
used shall be actuarial assumptions that comply with Section 417(e) of the Code and, specifically , are the
Code Section 417(e) assumptions that would be used under the Salaried Plan to pay a retirement lump sum
as of the date applicable that the lump sum in question is to be determined under this Article F .
(c)    A Covered U.K. Employee’ s Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit shall be determined on the basis
of assuming that the Covered U.K. employee voluntarily terminated employment and any other service
relationship with the PepsiCo Organization as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date.
(d)    This subsection applies if the terms of the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan or the U.K. Supplementary
Pension Appendix are amended during a year in a way that would change the results under the Section F .3
calculation, and such amendment otherwise applies earlier than the immediately following year . In this case, to
the extent that doing is necessary to comply with Code Section 409A, the calculation in Section F .3 shall be
made by delaying the application of the amendment so that it is prospectively ef fective starting with the
immediately following year .
(e)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F , (ii) has reached
his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then again Engages in U.S. Service and meets all of the requirements to be a
Covered U.K. Employee when he again Engages in U.S. Service, the foregoing terms shall be applied again to
determine if he earns a benefit for the new period that he Engages in U.S. Service, except that any resulting
benefit from this new period shall be reduced by the lump sum value of any
- 127 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
prior benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of benefits).
(f)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F , (ii) has reached
his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then is employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification that would
be eligible for an accrual under the provisions of the Plan other than this Article F (the “Other Provisions”), then
the Other Provisions shall be applied to determine if he earns a benefit under the Other Provisions for the new
period of service, except that any resulting benefit from this new period of service shall be reduced by the lump
sum value of any prior benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of
benefits).
F.5    No Other Benefits :
A Covered U.K. Employee shall not be entitled to any other benefits under this Plan or the Salaried Plan while
he is a Covered U.K. Employee (or while he would be a Covered U.K. Employee if clauses (iv) and (v) of Section F .2.
were not included in the definition of Covered U.K. Employee). In addition, prior to the time that an individual has
satisfied all of the requirements to be considered a Covered U.K. Employee, the individual has no legally binding right
to a benefit under this Article F . Accordingly , for the avoidance of doubt, at any point before such time, the Company
may take action that prevents the individual from becoming entitled to a benefit under this Article F ( e.g., by deciding
that it will not designate the individual as a Covered U.K. Employee, in an unfettered exercise of the Company’ s
discretion), regardless of the services performed or other actions taken by the individual through this point in time,
and regardless of any other factor .

Partner (if any) is the Participant’ s spouse pursuant to such same-sex marriage. If the Participant resides in
a state that permits same-sex marriage, the Participant is not eligible to have an Eligible Domestic Partner

APPENDIX ARTICLE I –
409A PEP Makeup for Certain Pre-409A Benefits
    I.1    Scope:
To ensure there will be no “material modification” of the Pre-409A Program, this Article provides a
makeup benefit under the 409A Program that applies to certain participants in the Pre-409A Program (“Pre-
409A Participants”) in lieu of updating the Pre-409A Program’ s actuarial factors for early commencement of
Vested Pensions to be consistent with the “2019 Salaried Program Factors” (as that term is defined in the
definition of Actuarial Equivalent). In the case of participants in the Pre-409A Program who are also
Participants in the 409A Program (without regard to this Article), this makeup relating to the early
commencement reduction of V ested Pensions payable as annuities is provided under the main text of the
Plan. However , this makeup is provided under this Article in the case of af fected Pre-409A Participants who
are otherwise not entitled to a benefit under the 409A Program.
I.2    Eligibility Under This Article :
To be eligible under this Article, an individual must be a Pre-409A Participant:
(a)    Who is paid a Pre-409A Pension that is (i) a “V ested Pension” under the Pre-409A Program, and
(ii) paid in the form of an annuity commencing as of a date prior to the Pre-409A Participant’ s Normal
Retirement Date but as of on or after January 1, 2019;
(b)     Whose Pre-409A Pension annuity under subsection (a) above is reduced for early
commencement under the terms of the Pre-409A Program by more
- 135 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
than it would be if the early commencement reduction were calculated using the 2019 Salaried Plan
Factors; and
(c)    Who otherwise would not have a 409A Pension that is payable ef fective as of January 1, 2019 or
later because, except as provided in this Article, the only PEP Pension to which the individual is entitled
is a Pre-409A Pension, or because his otherwise applicable 409A Pension commenced payment as of
prior to January 1, 2019.
An individual who satisfies all of the foregoing eligibility requirements shall be referred to as an “Eligible
Person” for purposes of this Article.
I.3    Benefit Amount Under This Article :
The benefit amount for an Eligible Person under this Article shall be the single lump sum that is the
Actuarial Equivalent of the dif ference between:
(a)    The Single Life Annuity that would be payable to the Eligible Person under the Pre-409A Program
as of the Eligible Person’ s Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program if the 2019 Salaried
Program Factors for early commencement applied in calculating such Single Life Annuity (including with
respect to any portion of the Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension that is derived from the PEP Guarantee),
and
(b)    The Single Life Annuity that is actually applicable to the Eligible Person under the Pre-409A
Program as of the Eligible Person’ s Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program, because of the
early commencement factors that
- 136 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
are actually applicable in calculating such Single Life Annuity (including with respect to any portion of
the Participant’ s Pre-409A Pension that is derived from the PEP Guarantee).
Such Actuarial Equivalent lump sum shall be calculated as of the applicable commencement date specified in
Section I.4 below; however , if the applicable commencement date is the Section I.4(b) date ( i.e. December 1,
2019) and the Eligible Person’ s actual Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program precedes December
1, 2019, then the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum shall be determined as of such actual Annuity Starting Date
and then brought forward with Actuarial Equivalent interest to December 1, 2019. For purposes of subsection
(a) above, the 2019 Salaried Program Factors shall be solely the new factors applicable under the Salaried
Program as of January 1, 2019 (and no alternative calculation using the factors in ef fect before January 1,
2019 shall apply).
I.4    Time of Payment Under This Article :
The lump sum benefit calculated under this Appendix shall be payable as of the Eligible Person’ s
applicable commencement date, which is the latest of the following:
(a)     The first of the month following the Eligible Person’ s Separation from Service,
(b)     December 1, 2019, or
- 137 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(c)     The first of the month following the Eligible Person’ s attainment of age 55 (except that this
subsection (c) shall not apply to the extent that the Eligible Person’ s benefit is derived from Article PBG
of this Appendix).
In the event that the Eligible Person’ s applicable commencement date is the date in subsection (a) above, then
the date of actual payment of the benefit shall be delayed to the extent provided by Section 6.6(a) of the main
text of the Plan, and in the case of such a delay , the benefit determined as of such applicable commencement
date shall be increased by interest for the period of delay as provided in Section 6.6(c) of the main text of the
Plan.
I.5    Non-Duplication of Benefits :
The foregoing Sections of this Article are intended to provide a make-up benefit under the 409A
Program for applying an early commencement reduction under the Pre-409A Program using factors that
predate the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors, with respect to a Pre-409A Pension that is paid in the form of an
annuity and that has an Annuity Starting Date of January 1, 2019 or later . However , no duplication of benefits
may occur at any time under the Plan. Therefore, to the extent an Eligible Person has received or will receive a
409A Pension that, without regard to this Article, ef fectively provides some or all of such makeup ( e.g.,
because the Eligible Person’ s 409A Pension was reduced for early commencement using Early Retirement
reduction factors), or to the extent that the Plan Administrator concludes that providing the makeup under this
Article would otherwise result in a duplication of benefits, the makeup benefit under this Article shall be
reduced (but not below zero) as the Plan Administrator deems
- 138 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
appropriate to eliminate all duplication of benefits. This provision shall govern over any contrary provision of
this Article or the Plan that might be interpreted to support a duplication of benefits.

APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG
Effective as of the end of the day on December 31, 2011, the PBG PEP is hereby merged with and into the PepsiCo
PEP, with the PepsiCo PEP as the surviving plan after the merger . The following Appendix Article PBG governs PBG
PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the merger , except as follows: (i) Articles VII
(Administration), VIII (Miscellaneous), IX (Amendment and T ermination), X (ERISA Plan Structure) and XI (Applicable
Law) of the main section of this document shall govern PBG PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP
Document, and (ii) ef fective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2019, if a Participant elects a survivor ,
period certain annuity or other death benefit annuity (or an annuity with other optional features), the adjustment of the
Single Life Annuity to Actuarial Equivalent optional annuity shall be determined under the provisions of the main
section of this document. There shall be no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to
Code section 409A under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP Document as a result of the plan merger or the
revisions made to the 409A PBG PEP Document when it was incorporated into this Appendix.
ARTICLE I T O APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - History and Purpose
1.1    History of Plan . The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (“PBG”) established the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP”
or “Plan”) ef fective April 6, 1999 for the benefit of salaried employees of the PBG Organization who participate in the
PBG Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). The Plan was initially established as a successor plan to
the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan, due to PBG’ s April 6, 1999 initial public of fering, and the Plan included
historical PepsiCo provisions which are relevant for eligibility and benefit determinations under the Plan. The Plan
provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the
- 140 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, the Plan
provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula. Effective April 1, 2009,
the Plan also provides benefits for employees whose eligible pay under the Salaried Plan is reduced due to the
employees’ elective deferrals under the PBG Executive Income Deferral Program and for certain executives who
would be “Grandfathered Participants” under the Salaried Plan but for their classification as salary band E3-E8 or MP
(or its equivalent, for periods on and after the Ef fective T ime). The Plan is intended as a nonqualified unfunded
deferred compensation plan for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Plan is structured as two plans. The portion of the Plan that provides benefits
based on limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) is intended to be an “excess
benefit plan” as described in Section 4(b)(5) of ERISA. The remainder of the Plan is intended to be a plan described
in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA providing benefits to a select group of management or highly-
compensated employees.
The Plan has been amended from time to time, most recently in the form of an amendment and complete restatement
effective as of April 1, 2009 (“2009 Restatement”). PBG further amended the Plan as a result of the merger of PBG
with and into Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company , Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc. (the
“Company”), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 3, 2009 among PBG, the Company
and Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Company , Inc., and to facilitate the Company’ s assumption of PBG’ s role as the Plan’ s
sponsor .
1.2    Effect of Amendment and Restatement . The Plan as in ef fect on October 3, 2004 is referred to herein as the
Prior Plan.
- 141 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Except as otherwise explicitly provided in Section 6.1(b)(3) of this Plan, a Participant’ s benefit (including death
benefits), determined under the terms of the Plan as in ef fect on October 3, 2004 as if the Participant had terminated
employment on December 31, 2004, without regard to any compensation paid or services rendered after 2004, or any
other events af fecting the amount of or the entitlement to benefits (other than the Participant’ s survival or the
Participant’ s election under the terms of the Plan with respect to the time or form of benefit) (the “Grandfathered
Benefit”) shall be paid at the time and in the form provided by the terms of the Plan as in ef fect on October 3, 2004.
The benefit of a Participant accrued under this Plan based on all compensation and services taken into account by
the Prior Plan and this Plan, less the Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be paid in the times and in the form as
provided in this Plan. Except as otherwise explicitly provided in this Plan, this Plan superseded the Prior Plan
effective January 1, 2009, with respect to amounts accrued and vested after 2004 by Participants who had not
commenced receiving benefits as of January 1, 2009. The Plan was administered in accordance with a good faith
interpretation of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and IRS regulations and guidance thereunder from
January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2008. Amounts accrued under this Plan after 2004 shall be treated as
payable under a separate Plan for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

foregoing, for the periods on after April 1, 2010, Key Employees shall be identified as follows:
(i)     For the period that begins on April 1, 2010, and ends on March 31, 2011, an

by applying as of such December 31 the default rules that apply under such regulation for determining the minimum
number of a service recipient’ s specified employees. If the preceding sentence and the methods for identifying
Specified Employees set forth in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, taken together , would result in more than 200
individuals being counted as Specified Employees as of any December 31 determination date, then the number of
individuals treated as Specified Employees pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii), who are not described in the first
sentence of this subparagraph (iii), shall be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those employees
otherwise added by such subparagraph in order of their base compensation, from the lowest base compensation to
the highest.

(ii)    if applicable, the amount determined in accordance with Section 4.2, expressed in
such form and payable as of such time; over
(2)    The amount of the monthly pension benefit that is in fact payable to such Salaried Plan
Participant under the Salaried Plan, expressed in such form and payable as of such time.
- 152 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
The amount of the monthly pension benefit so determined, less the portion of such benefit that is the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be payable as provided in Section 6.2.
(b)    Different Form than Salaried Plan . If a Participant’ s PEP Pension will be paid in a dif ferent form
(whether in whole or in part) or will commence as of a dif ferent time than his pension benefit under the
Salaried Plan, his PEP Pension shall be the product of:
(1)    The greater of:
(i)    the monthly pension benefit which would have been payable to such Participant
under the Salaried Plan without regard to (I) the Compensation Limitation; (II) the Section 415
Limitation; (III) the exclusion from Earnings of amounts deferred at the election of the Participant
under the EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 2011; and (IV) the March 31, 2009
through December 31, 2010 exclusion from the Salaried Plan definition of a Grandfathered
Participant of a Participant who, as of such date, was classified as salary band E3-E8 or MP and
had attained age 50 and completed five years of Service or whose sum of his age and years of
Service was at least 65; and
(ii)    if applicable, the amount determined in accordance with Section 4.2, expressed in
the form and payable as of such time as applies to his PEP Pension under this Plan, multiplied
by
(2)    A fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the amount determined in Section 4.1(b)
(1), reduced by the value of his pension under the
- 153 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Salaried Plan, and the denominator of which is the value of the amount determined in Section 4.1(b)(1)
(with value determined on a reasonable and consistent basis, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator ,
with respect to similarly situated employees).
The amount of the monthly pension benefit so determined, less the portion of such benefit that is the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be payable as provided in Section 6.2.
Notwithstanding the above, in the event any portion of the accrued benefit of a Participant under this
Plan or the Salaried Plan is awarded to an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order , as
such terms are defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, the Participant’ s total PEP Pension shall be adjusted, as
the Plan Administrator shall determine, so that the combined benefit payable to the Participant and the
alternate payee from this Plan and the Salaried Plan is the amount determined pursuant to subsections 4.1(a)
and (b) above, as applicable.
4.2    PEP Guarantee . Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be
entitled to a PEP Guarantee benefit determined under subsection (b) below , if any .
(a)    Eligibility . A Participant shall be covered by this section if the Participant has 1988 pensionable
earnings from an Employer of at least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable earnings”
means the Participant’ s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year that was recognized for benefit accrual
received under the Salaried Plan as in ef fect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include
remuneration from an entity attributable to any period when that entity was not an Employer .
- 154 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(b)    PEP Guarantee Formula . The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee shall be determined
under paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).
(1)    Formula . The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this paragraph shall be
determined as follows:
(i)    Three percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for the first 10
years of Credited Service, plus
(ii)    One percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for each year of
Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less
(iii)    One and two-thirds percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount
multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.
In determining the amount of a V ested Pension, the PEP Guarantee shall first be calculated on
the basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he continued to accrue
Credited Service until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and
Primary Social Security Amount at the earlier of his Severance from Service Date or the date such
Participant ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and this Plan, and then
shall be reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Participant’ s actual years of Credited Service on the earlier of his Severance from Service Date or the
date such Participant ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and this Plan
and the denominator of which is the years of Credited Service
- 155 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
he would have earned had he continued to accrue Credited Service until his Normal Retirement Age.
(2)    Calculation . The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to paragraph
(1) above, subject to the following special rules:
(i)    Surviving Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Annuity : Subject to
subparagraph (iii) below and the last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner and has commenced receipt of an Annuity under
this section, the Participant’ s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be entitled to
receive a survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the Participant’ s Annuity under this section, with
no corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall begin on the first day of the month coincident
with or following the Participant’ s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to
the Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner is more than 10 years younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit
payable under this subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided below .
(A)    For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving Eligible
Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit
payable to such
- 156 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by 0.8 percent.
(B)    For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by an additional 0.4
percent.
This subparagraph applies only to a Participant who retires on or after his Early
Retirement Date.
(ii)    Reductions . The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’ s PEP
Guarantee.
(A)    If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment
amount shall be reduced by 3/12  of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit
commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal
Retirement Date.
(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment amount shall be
reduced to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date (if
payment commences before such date), and the reductions set forth in the Salaried Plan for any
Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s coverage or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s coverage shall apply .ths
- 157 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that
provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the life of the
surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner , that is greater than that provided under
subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be
reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial
Equivalent of the PEP Guarantee otherwise payable under the foregoing provisions of this
section.
(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that
provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic
Partner . In this instance, the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so
that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of
a Single Life Annuity for the Participant’ s life.
(E)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in an Annuity
form that includes inflation protection described in the Salaried Plan. In this instance, the
Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the
benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the elected Annuity
without such protection.
(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion . The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section
for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will
- 158 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
be distributed in the form of a lump sum shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP
Guarantee determined under this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under
subparagraph (i) above and any early retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
(iv)    April 1, 2009 Salaried Plan Changes.
(A)    The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section for a Participant
who, as of March 31, 2009, was classified as salary band E3-E8 or MP and who had attained
age 50 and completed five years of Service or (inclusively) whose sum of his age and years of
Service was at least 65 shall be determined as if such Participant were a Grandfathered
Participant in the Salaried Plan on April 1, 2009 (so that Earnings and Credited Service were not
frozen as of March 31, 2009 for the period April 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010).
(B)    Highest A verage Monthly Earnings shall be determined without regard to the
exclusion from Earnings under the Salaried Plan of amounts deferred at the election of the
Participant under the EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 2011.
4.3    Certain Adjustments . Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject to
adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan or a
nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored by a
member of the PBG Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals (this category of similar
plans includes the PepsiCo Prior Plan).
- 159 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(a)    Adjustments for Rehired Participants . This subsection shall apply to a current or former
Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and (i) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is
recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service, or (ii) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan
would have been recalculated, based on an additional period of Credited Service if the Participant would have
been considered a Grandfathered Participant as defined in Section 3.7 of the Salaried Plan if the Participant
was not classified by the Employer as salary band E3-E8 or MP . In such event, the Participant’ s PEP Pension
shall be recalculated hereunder . For this purpose, the PEP Guarantee under Section 4.2 is adjusted for in-
service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried
Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified plans.
(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans . If the benefit paid under a specified plan
on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the
increase is by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), the
PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder ,
the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically
intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.
(c)    No Benefit Offsets That W ould V iolate Section 409A . If a Participant has earned a benefit under
a plan maintained by a member of the PepsiCo/PBG Organization that is a “qualifying plan” for purposes of the
“Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.8 of Part A of the Salaried Plan and the “T ransfers and Non-Duplication”
rule in
- 160 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Section 3.6 of Part C of the Salaried Plan, such T ransfers and Non-Duplication rules shall apply when
calculating the amount determined under Section 4.1(a)(1) or 4.1(b)(1) above (as applicable) only to the extent
the application of such rule will not result in a change in the time or form of payment of such pension that is
prohibited by Section 409A. For purposes of the limit on of fsets in the preceding sentence, it is the Company’ s
intent to undertake to make special arrangements with respect to the payment of the benefit under the
qualifying plan that are legally permissible under the qualifying plan, and compliant with Section 409A, in order
to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the maximum extent possible; to the extent that Section
409A compliant special arrangements are timely put into ef fect in a particular situation, the limit on of fsets in
the prior sentence will not apply .
4.4    Reemployment of Certain Participants . In the case of a current or former Participant who is
reemployed and is eligible to reparticipate in the Salaried Plan after his Annuity Starting Date, payment of his non-
Grandfathered PEP Pension will not be suspended. If such Participant accrues an additional PEP Pension for service
after such reemployment, his PEP Pension on his subsequent Separation from Service shall be reduced by the
present value of PEP benefits previously distributed to such Participant, as determined by the Plan Administrator .
4.5    Vesting; Misconduct . Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant shall be fully vested in his Accrued Benefit at
the time he becomes fully vested in his accrued benefit under the Salaried Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, or
any other provision of the Plan to the contrary , a Participant shall forfeit his or her entire PEP Pension if the Plan
Administrator determines that such Participant has engaged in “Misconduct” as defined below , determined
- 161 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
without regard to whether the Misconduct occurred before or after the Participant’ s Severance from Service. The Plan
Administrator may , in its sole discretion, require the Participant to pay to the Employer any PEP Pension paid to the
Participant within the twelve month period immediately preceding a date on which the Participant has engaged in
such Misconduct, as determined by the Plan Administrator .
“Misconduct” means any of the following, as determined by the Plan Administrator in good faith: (i) violation of
any agreement between the Company or Employer and the Participant, including but not limited to a violation relating
to the disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers, suppliers,
licensors or contractors, or the performance of competitive services, (ii) violation of any duty to the Company or
Employer , including but not limited to violation of the Company’ s Code of Conduct; (iii) making, or causing or
attempting to cause any other person to make, any statement (whether written, oral or electronic), or conveying any
information about the Company or Employer which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the
Company or Employer unless required by law or pursuant to a Company or Employer policy; (iv) improperly
disclosing or otherwise misusing any confidential information regarding the Company or Employer; (v) unlawful
trading in the securities of the Company or of another company based on information garnered as a result of that
Participant’ s employment or other relationship with the Company; (vi) engaging in any act which is considered to be
contrary to the best interests of the Company or Employer , including but not limited to recruiting or soliciting
employees of the Employer; or (vii) commission of a felony or other serious crime or engaging in any activity which
constitutes gross misconduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall
prohibit the Participant from communicating with government
- 162 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
authorities concerning any possible legal violations.  The Company nonetheless asserts and does not waive its
attorney-client privilege over any information appropriately protected by the privilege.
ARTICLE V T O APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - Death Benefits
5.1    Death Benefits . Each Participant entitled to a PEP Pension under this Plan who dies before his Annuity
Starting Date shall be entitled to a death benefit equal in amount to the additional death benefit to which the
Participant would have been entitled under the Salaried Plan if the PEP Pension as determined under Article IV was
payable under the Salaried Plan instead of this Plan. The death benefit with respect to a Participant’ s PEP Pension in
excess of the Grandfathered Benefit shall become payable on the Participant’ s date of death in a Single Lump Sum
payment.
Payment of any death benefit of a Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date under the Plan shall
be made to the persons and in the proportions to which any death benefit under the Salaried Plan is or would be paid

(iii) before receiving 120 payments under the form of payment, then the remaining payments due under
such form of payment shall be paid to the Participant’ s estate. If payments have commenced under

Participant whose employment was involuntarily terminated as a result of the 2008 Reorganization on or after

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Section 162(m) of the Code. In the event any payment is delayed solely as a result of the preceding restriction, such
payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible following the first date as of which Section 162(m) of the

satisfaction of the Committee, and (iii) have not engaged in any acts that are considered by the Committee to constitute Misconduct. If the

acts that are considered by the Committee to constitute Misconduct, the Participant shall be obligated, upon demand, to return the gross
amount of such Award to the Company.

subject to transfer, assignment or alienation, whether voluntary or involuntary.th

Plan.
 
(d) No Rights to Awards. Except as set forth herein, no Company employee or other person shall have any claim or right to be
granted an award under the Plan. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any employee any right to be
retained in the employ of PepsiCo or any of its subsidiaries, divisions or affiliates or to interfere with the ability of the Company to terminate
any such employee’s employment relationship at any time. At no time before the actual payment of an Award shall any Participant or other
person accrue any vested interest or right whatsoever under the Plan, and the Company has no obligation to treat Participants identically
under the Plan.
 
(e) Costs and Expenses. The cost and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and shall not be
charged to any Award or to any Participant receiving an Award.
 
(f) No Funding of Plan. The Plan shall be unfunded, and the Awards shall be paid solely from the general assets of the Company.
The Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the
payment of any Award under the Plan. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments under the Plan, the right is no
greater than the right of any other unsecured general creditor.
 
(g) Offset for Monies Owed. Any payments made under the Plan will be offset for any monies that are owed to the Company to the
extent permitted by applicable law, including Section 409A if such payment is subject to Section 409A.
 
(h) Other Incentive Plans. Nothing contained in the Plan shall prohibit the Company from granting other performance awards to
employees of the Company (including Participants) under such other incentive arrangements, and in such form and manner, as it deems
desirable.

such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise of all or substantially all of the business or
assets of PepsiCo.
 
(j) Section 409A. To the extent that any Award under the Plan is subject to Section 409A, the terms and administration of such
Award shall comply with the provisions of Section 409A, and, to the extent necessary to achieve compliance, shall be modified at the
discretion of the Committee. The Company makes no representation that any Award is exempt from or complies with Section 409A and
makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to Awards. The Company will have no liability to any Participant or to any
other party if an Award that is intended to be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant or for any action
taken by the Committee with respect thereto.
 
(k) Severability. If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed
or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the
Committee, materially altering the purpose or intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, and the
remainder of the Plan or Award shall remain in full force and effect.
