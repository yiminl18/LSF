“Today we are reporting Q4 sales that were in line with our expectations and profitability that was better than 
expected,” said Corie Barry, Best Buy CEO. “Throughout Q4 and FY23, we remained committed to balancing our 
near-term response to current conditions and managing well what is in our control, while also advancing our 
strategic initiatives and investing in areas important for our long-term performance.” 
 
“We believe the macro and industry backdrop will continue to be pressured in FY24 and we will continue to adjust,” 
Barry added. “At the same time, we remain incredibly excited about our industry and our future - there are more 
technology products than ever in peoples’ homes, technology is increasingly a necessity in our lives, and 
technology innovation will continue. Our initiatives to deliver our omnichannel retail model evolution, build customer 
relationships through membership, and remove cost and improve efficiency and effectiveness will allow us to 
deliver even more experiences no one else can and capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us.”

 FY24 Financial Guidance 
 
“As we enter FY24,  the consumer electronics industry continues to feel the effects of the broader macro 
environment and its impact on consumers,” said Matt Bilunas, Best Buy CFO. “As a result, our outlook assumes 
comparable sales decline 3% to 6% for the year, with the most sales pressure in the first quarter, as year-over-year 
comparisons ease through the year.”   
 
“During FY24, we expect to expand our gross profit rate approximately 40 to 70 basis points versus the past year 
as we evolve our membership program and realize benefits from our cost optimization efforts,” Bilunas continued. 
“Non-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to increase versus last year as our cost takeout initiatives and lower 
variable costs are offset by the addback of incentive compensation, the extra week and higher depreciation.”  
 
Best Buy is providing the following financial guidance for FY24, which includes 53 weeks. 
 
 Revenue of $43.8 billion to $45.2 billion 
 Comparable sales decline of 3.0% to 6.0%  
 Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate2 of 3.7% to 4.1%   
 Non-GAAP effective income tax rate2 of approximately 24.5% 
 Non-GAAP diluted EPS2 of $5.70 to $6.50 
 Capital expenditures of approximately $850 million 
 
Note: Incorporated in the above guidance, the 53rd week is expected to add approximately $700 million of revenue 
to Q4 FY24 and provide a benefit of approximately 10 basis points to the company’s full year non-GAAP operating 
income rate.2   
 
Domestic Segment Q4 FY23 Results 
 
Domestic Revenue 
Domestic revenue of $13.53 billion decreased 9.8% versus last year primarily driven by a comparable sales decline 
of 9.6%. 
 
From a merchandising perspective, the largest drivers of the comparable sales decline on a weighted basis were 
computing, home theater, appliances and mobile phones. These drivers were partially offset by growth in the 
gaming and tablet categories. 
 
Domestic online revenue of $5.14 billion decreased 13.0% on a comparable basis, and as a percentage of total 
Domestic revenue, online revenue was 38.0% versus 39.4% last year.   
 
Domestic Gross Profit Rate 
Domestic gross profit rate was 19.8% versus 20.0% last year. The lower gross profit rate was primarily due to lower 
product margin rates, which were partially offset by favorable services margin rates and higher profit-sharing 
revenue from the company’s private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. The improved services margin 
rates were primarily driven by an approximately $30 million profit-sharing benefit from the company’s services plan 
portfolio.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
 Domestic Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”) 
Domestic GAAP SG&A was $2.07 billion, or 15.3% of revenue, versus $2.30 billion, or 15.3% of revenue, last year. 
On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A was $2.05 billion, or 15.1% of revenue, versus $2.27 billion, or 15.1% of revenue, 
last year. Both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A decreased primarily due to reduced store payroll expense, incentive 
compensation and advertising expenses.  
 
International Segment Q4 FY23 Results 
 
International Revenue 
International revenue of $1.20 billion decreased 12.2% versus last year. This decrease was primarily driven by a 
comparable sales decline of 5.7% and the negative impact of approximately 570 basis points from foreign currency 
exchange rates.  
 
International Gross Profit Rate 
International gross profit rate was 21.7% versus 22.9% last year. The lower gross profit rate was primarily driven by 
lower product margin rates, which included increased promotions, and a lower mix of revenue from the higher 
margin rate services category.  
 
International SG&A 
International SG&A was $189 million, or 15.7% of revenue, versus $206 million, or 15.0% of revenue, last year. 
SG&A decreased primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and lower incentive compensation. 
 
Restructuring Charges 
 
The company incurred $86 million of restructuring costs in Q4 FY23, primarily related to employee termination 
benefits associated with an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced in Q2 FY23 to better align its 
spending with critical strategies and operations, as well as to optimize its cost structure. Consistent with prior 
practice, restructuring costs are excluded from the company’s non-GAAP results. 
 
Share Repurchases and Dividends 
 
In Q4 FY23, the company returned a total of $743 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $549 
million and dividends of $194 million. For the full year, the company returned a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders 
through share repurchases of $1.0 billion and dividends of $789 million.   
 
Today, the company announced its board of directors approved a 5% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to 
$0.92 per share. The regular quarterly dividend will be payable on April 13, 2023, to shareholders of record as of 
the close of business on March 23, 2023.

 Notes: 
(1) The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of 
calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. For additional information on 
comparable sales, please see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our subsequent Quarterly Reports 
on Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and available at 
www.investors.bestbuy.com . 
 
(2) A reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP operating income rate, non-GAAP effective income tax rate and non-
GAAP diluted EPS, which are forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, to the most directly comparable 
GAAP financial measures, is not provided because the company is unable to provide such reconciliation without 
unreasonable effort. The inability to provide a reconciliation is due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty 
predicting the occurrence, the financial impact and the periods in which the non-GAAP adjustments may be 
recognized. These GAAP measures may include the impact of such items as restructuring charges; price -fixing 
settlements; goodwill impairments; gains and losses on investments; intangible asset amortization; certain 
acquisition- related costs; and the tax effect of all such items. Historically, the company has excluded these items 
from non-GAAP financial measures. The company currently expects to continue to exclude these items in future 
disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures and may also exclude other items that may arise (collectively, “non-
GAAP adjustments”). The decisions and events that typically lead to the recognition of non-GAAP adjustments, 
such as a decision to exit part of the business or reaching settlement of a legal dispute, are inherently 
unpredictable as to if or when they may occur. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the 
probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
($ in millions, except per share amounts) 
(Unaudited and subject to reclassification) 
 
The following information provides reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP financial measures) to presented non-GAAP financial measures. 
The company believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can 
provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance. For 
these reasons, internal management reporting also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, presented non-GAAP 
financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, price-fixing settlements, goodwill impairments, 
gains and losses on investments, intangible asset amortization, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such 
items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-GAAP financial measures when the company believes this 
provides greater clarity to management and investors. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, 
and not superior to or as a substitute for, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release and the company’s 
financial statements and other publicly filed reports. Non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable 
to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

(1) Represents the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets associated with acquisitions, including customer relationships, 
tradenames and developed technology assets.  
(2) Represents charges associated with acquisition-related transaction and due diligence costs, primarily comprised of professional fees.  
(3) Represents charges primarily related to employee termination benefits in the Domestic segment associated with an enterprise-
wide initiative that commenced in Q2 FY23 to better align the company’s spending with critical strategies and operations, as well 
as to optimize its cost structure, for the periods ended January 28, 2023. Represents charges and subsequent adjustments primarily related 
to actions taken in the Domestic segment to better align the company’s organizational structure with its strategic focus and the exit from 
operations in Mexico in the International segment for the periods ended January 29, 2022.  
(4) Represents inventory markdown adjustments recorded within cost of sales associated with the exit from operations in Mexico.  
(5) The non-GAAP adjustments primarily relate to the U.S., Canada and Mexico. As such, the income tax charge is calculated using the 
statutory tax rate of 24.5% for the U.S. and 26.4% for Canada applied to the non-GAAP adjustments of each country. There is no income 
tax charge for Mexico non-GAAP items and a minimal amount of U.S. non-GAAP items, as there was no tax benefit recognized on these 
expenses in the calculation of GAAP income tax expense.

 Return on Assets and Non-GAAP Return on Investment 
 
The tables below provide calculations of return on assets ("ROA") (GAAP financial measure) and non-GAAP return on 
investment (“ROI”) (non-GAAP financial measure) for the periods presented. The company believes ROA is the most directly 
comparable financial measure to ROI. Non-GAAP ROI is defined as non-GAAP adjusted operating income after tax divided by 
average invested operating assets. All periods presented below apply this methodology consistently. The company believes non-
GAAP ROI is a meaningful metric for investors to evaluate capital efficiency because it measures how key assets are deployed 
by adjusting operating income and total assets for the items noted below. This method of determining non-GAAP ROI may differ 
from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies.

(1) Income statement accounts represent the activity for the trailing 12 months ended as of each of the balance sheet dates. Balance sheet 
accounts represent the average account balances for the trailing 12 months ended as of each of the balance sheet dates. 
(2) Non-GAAP operating income adjustments include continuing operations adjustments for restructuring charges, intangible asset 
amortization and acquisition-related transaction costs. Additional details regarding these adjustments are included in the Reconciliation of 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures schedule in this earnings release. 
(3) Operating lease interest represents the add-back to operating income to approximate the total interest expense that the company would 
incur if its operating leases were owned and financed by debt. The add-back is approximated by multiplying average operating lease assets 
by 4%, which approximates the interest rate on the company’s operating lease liabilities. 
(4) Income taxes are approximated by using a blended statutory rate at the Enterprise level based on statutory rates from the countries in 
which the company does business, which primarily consists of the U.S. with a statutory rate of 24.5% for the periods presented. 
(5) Operating lease amortization represents operating lease cost less operating lease interest. Operating lease cost includes short-term leases, 
which are immaterial, and excludes variable lease costs as these costs are not included in the operating lease asset balance. 
(6) Excess cash represents the amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments greater than $1 billion, which approximates the 
amount of cash the company believes is necessary to run the business and may fluctuate over time. 
(7) Accumulated depreciation and amortization represents accumulated depreciation related to property and equipment and accumulated 
amortization related to definite-lived intangible assets. 
(8) Adjusted current liabilities represent total current liabilities less short-term debt and the current portions of operating lease liabilities and 
long-term debt .
