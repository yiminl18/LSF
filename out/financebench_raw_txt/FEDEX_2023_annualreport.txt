2023 Annual ReportCELEBRATING 50 YEARS.  
DRIVING WHAT’S NEXT.
To our FedEx stockholders,
This year, FedEx marked 50 years of transforming the world by connecting people and possibilities. While a great deal has 
changed over the years, one thing that remains constant is our unwavering commitment to our customers and communities. 
We celebrated our 50th anniversary by giving back across the globe, with our team members volunteering in the communities 
they serve every day. 
Doing good is a core value of FedEx, and one that inspired our team to achieve another major milestone — exceeding our FedEx 
Cares 50 by 50 goal of helping 50 million people by our 50th birthday. 
I am proud that our team is committed to delivering good in the world — and to building a stronger, smarter FedEx for the next 
50 years and beyond. From day one, we changed the world with express overnight delivery. Now, we are changing it again, as we 
build the most flexible, efficient, and intelligent network.
Despite a challenging demand environment in FY23, we took action to deliver on this strategy in a powerful way — by 
strengthening our enterprise and continuing to put our customers at the heart of everything we do. 
We focused on optimizing our network, aligning costs to volume levels, and harnessing the power of our digital intelligence to 
drive what’s next and deliver greater value to our customers and stockholders.
Making momentum with DRIVE
In early FY23, we launched DRIVE, our enterprise transformation, to enhance network efficiency, improve service, cut costs, and 
strengthen our performance culture. DRIVE has gained significant momentum, and we expect to realize $4 billion in permanent 
and structural cost savings in FY25. In addition, we expect an incremental $2 billion of savings in FY27 as we realize the full 
benefits of Network 2.0.
Our FY23 results demonstrated our resolute commitment to transform our business into a more nimble, efficient, and profitable 
network. We successfully reduced costs on an annual basis by more than $2 billion, laying a strong foundation to execute on 
DRIVE in FY24.
DRIVE is the most extensive undertaking in our company’s history and unprecedented in scale. Through a meticulous, bottom-up 
view of our organization over the last several months, we have established 14 DRIVE domains. Each domain is led by an executive 
sponsor who reports to me to ensure we meet our target cost and efficiency improvements. 
This effort is not only to identify opportunities to transform our business, but also to understand how we do business. DRIVE 
requires us to work differently through a more technology-enabled, data-driven approach, as we build the smartest logistics 
network in the world.
As just one example, machine learnings and key insights are driving our dock modernization efforts at FedEx Ground, helping us 
run our docks smarter with more detailed and accurate volume forecasts. For the first time in company history, the FedEx Ground 
team expanded margins this fiscal year despite lower volumes. This is a clear indication our transformation is working and gives 
us confidence as we push forward. 
In addition, we made excellent progress implementing structural cost savings at FedEx Express, including domestic efficiency 
initiatives. This includes the shift to a single daily dispatch of couriers, which achieved its target of $50 million in fourth quarter 
savings, as well as accelerated hub productivity measures.
Our DRIVE savings are starting to materially impact our financial outcomes. We have significant margin expansion opportunities 
as we lower our cost base and maintain our focus on revenue quality. This is empowering us to deliver value to our stockholders 
today, as we transform for tomorrow.
CELEBRATING 50 YEARS. DRIVING 
WHAT’S NEXT.

One team. One vision.  
FedEx has continuously evolved to meet the needs of our customers and the market. This relentless pursuit of improvement 
is a hallmark of our company and key to our future. In April, we announced an exciting new evolution and the next milestone 
for FedEx — bringing the enterprise together as one FedEx.
With a phased approach planned for June 2024, we will streamline our operating companies into one unified organization. 
This move will leverage the strengths of our networks, people, and assets in new ways as we build the world’s smartest 
logistics network.
We will create more flexibility in our networks, simplify our processes, and expand our unmatched digital intelligence — all to 
make supply chains smarter for everyone.
A streamlined structure will facilitate a distinct focus on air and international volume, a more holistic approach to how we move 
packages on the ground, and enhanced visibility into the performance of our network with seamless interoperability. In turn, 
this will lower our cost to serve, improve capital efficiency, and strengthen enterprise collaboration in support of DRIVE and 
Network 2.0. 
As we continue to harness the power of one FedEx, we will unlock significant value for our stockholders, serve our customers with 
excellence, and support our people into the future.
To the future: one FedEx 
I am energized by the exciting path ahead of us as we enter FY24 with momentum and a shared determination to build a 
stronger, nimbler FedEx. While we will continue to evolve, our Purple Promise — to make every  FedEx experience outstanding — 
remains constant. 
Our long-term strategy is focused on amplifying our fundamental strengths — entrepreneurial spirit, legacy of digital innovation, 
and iconic culture — to deliver for our customers and drive profitable growth now and into the future. 
In our entire existence, FedEx has never waited on change. We create it. And this is the spirit we will bring to transforming the 
world for another half century and beyond. I am immensely proud of what we delivered over the last 50 years, and I look forward 
to how we will drive what’s next as  one FedEx.
Sincerely,
RAJ SUBRAMANIAM

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 
Overview 
FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company and provide 
strategic direction to the FedEx portfolio of companies. FedEx provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of 
transportation, e-commerce, and business services, offering integrated business solutions through operating companies competing 
collectively, operating collaboratively, and innovating digitally as one FedEx. These companies are included in the following 
reportable business segments:  
•    FedEx Express : Federal Express Corporation (“FedEx Express”) is the world’s largest express transportation company, 
offering time-definite delivery to more than 220 countries and territories, connecting markets that comprise more than 99% of 
the world’s gross domestic product. 
•    FedEx Ground : FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (“FedEx Ground”) is a leading North American provider of small-
package ground delivery services. FedEx Ground provides low-cost, day-certain service to any business address in the U.S. and 
Canada, as well as residential delivery to 100% of U.S. residences through its FedEx Home Delivery service. FedEx Ground 
Economy specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer 
packages. 
•    FedEx Freight : FedEx Freight Corporation (“FedEx Freight”) is a leading North American provider of less-than-truckload 
(“LTL”) freight transportation services across all lengths of haul to businesses and residences. Within the contiguous U.S., 
FedEx Freight offers FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet a customer’s supply chain needs; FedEx Freight 
Economy, when a customer can trade time for cost savings; and FedEx Freight Direct, a service to meet the needs of the 
growing e-commerce market for delivery of big and bulky products to or through the door for residences and businesses. FedEx 
Freight also offers freight delivery service to most points in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
•    FedEx Services : FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. (“FedEx Services”) provides sales, marketing, information technology, 
communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain back-office functions that 
support our operating segments. 
The FedEx Dataworks, Inc. (“FedEx Dataworks”) operating segment is focused on creating solutions to transform the digital and 
physical experiences of our customers and team members. ShopRunner, Inc. (“ShopRunner”) was merged into FedEx Dataworks 
during 2023. Additionally, the FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. (“FedEx Office”) operating segment provides document and 
business services and retail access to our package transportation businesses and the FedEx Logistics, Inc. (“FedEx Logistics”) 
operating segment provides customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding through FedEx Trade Networks Transport 
& Brokerage, Inc. (“FedEx Trade Networks Transport & Brokerage”) and integrated supply chain management solutions through

One FedEx and Network 2.0
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced “one FedEx”, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, 
FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a 
unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight will continue to provide LTL freight 
transportation services as a stand-alone and separate company under Federal Express Corporation. The organizational redesign will be 
implemented in phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation 
program to improve long-term profitability, including Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx 
picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada. 
We have announced the implementation of Network 2.0 in more than 20 markets, including the phased transition of all FedEx Ground 
operations and personnel in Canada to FedEx Express beginning in April 2024. Under Network 2.0, FedEx will continue to utilize 
both employees and contracted service providers. See “Business Segments” below, “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and “Item 7. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more 
information on one FedEx, Network 2.0, and DRIVE.
Strategy 
The collective FedEx brand gives us our competitive edge. Further, our strategy allows us to manage our business as a portfolio, in the 
long-term best interest of the enterprise. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment and service additions or enhancements 
upon achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for our business as a whole. We focus on making appropriate 
investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our long-term earnings performance and cash flow. Our business 
strategy also provides flexibility in structuring our network to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for 
the market segments in which they operate, allowing us to leverage and manage change. Volatility, uncertainty, and evolution have 
become the norms in the global transportation market, and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in 
the global economy.
 
Over the last 50 years, we built networks that have created a differentiated and unmatched portfolio of services while continuously 
evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers and the market. We made significant investments in our service network in 
recent years to build out our infrastructure and services to meet increased e-commerce demand. Through one FedEx and Network 2.0, 
we are building a simplified experience to better serve our customers with enhanced capabilities and transforming to operate with 
more flexibility, efficiency, and intelligence. One FedEx and Network 2.0 will leverage the strength of our networks, people, and 
assets in more efficient ways, enabling a distinct focus on air and international volume while facilitating a more holistic approach to 
how we move packages on the ground.
 
Innovation inspired our start at FedEx 50 years ago, and it is fueling our future as we combine logistics with digital intelligence. 
Leveraging the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks, developments in data and technology are facilitating the execution of our DRIVE 
transformation by creating new opportunities to improve our operational efficiency by optimizing our existing physical capacity and 
staffing. See “Business Segments” below for more information. Additionally, the size and scale of our global network gives us key 
insights into global supply chains and trends. This foundation provides an immense amount of data we can use to build better insights, 
improve the customer experience, and differentiate our service offering. To fully harness the power of this data, FedEx Dataworks is 
focused on putting our data into context and using it to enhance the efficiency of the FedEx network and our customers’ supply chains, 
as well as the end-to-end experience of our customers. 
 
“Safety Above All” is the first and foremost value in every aspect of our business. We are committed to making our workplaces and 
communities safer for our team members, customers, and the public. This philosophy is embedded in our day-to-day work through 
rigorous policies, continual education and engagement, and investments in technology designed to prevent accidents.
 
Through our global transportation, information technology, and retail networks, we help to facilitate an ongoing and unprecedented 
expansion of customer access — to goods, services, and information. We believe it would be extremely difficult, costly, and time-
consuming to replicate our global network, which reflects decades of investment, innovation, and expertise, includes the world’s 
largest all-cargo air fleet, and connects more than 99% of the world’s gross domestic product. We continue to position our company 
and team members to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger long-term growth, productivity, and profitability.
 
- 4 -During 2023 and early 2024, we introduced and expanded a number of innovative solutions, advanced important long-term business 
initiatives, and made other important investments that benefit our customers, team members, communities, and other stakeholders, 
including:
•    Launching DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve our long-term profitability, including Network 2.0, the multi-year 
effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada.
•    Announcing one FedEx, our consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and 
other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully 
integrated air-ground network.
•    Expanding Picture Proof of Delivery to 90% of global residential deliveries.
•    Improving service at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground through the reopening and completion of intra-European road hubs 
and continued enhancements to route optimization and package handler scheduling technologies.
•    Offering FedEx Consolidated Returns in the U.S., a low-priced, customer-friendly e-commerce returns option facilitated 
through supply chain services offered by FedEx Logistics and FedEx Office.
•    Introducing FedEx Sustainability Insights in the U.S., a cloud-based engine that harnesses scan data from our global logistics 
network to enhance customer access to emissions information.
•    Exceeding our FedEx Cares 50 by 50 goal of positively impacting 50 million people around the world by our 50th 
anniversary in April 2023.
Reputation and Responsibility 
FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected companies in the world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing 
tool. Among the many reputation awards we received during 2023, FedEx ranked 18th  in FORTUNE  magazine’s “World’s Most 
Admired Companies” list — the 23rd consecutive year FedEx has ranked among the top 20 in the FORTUNE  Most Admired 
Companies list, with 15 of those years ranking among the top 10. We also retained our position as the highest ranked delivery 
company on the “World’s Most Admired Companies” list. Additionally, in 2023 Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing 
the standards of ethical business practices, named FedEx as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies®. 
Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great place to work. For 
example, in 2023 FedEx was named the 21st best workplace overall in FORTUNE  magazine’s list of the “World’s Best Workplaces.”  
The success of our efforts is built on our sound ESG practices, which are aligned with our strategic focus. Our 2023 ESG Report is 
available at fedex.com/en-us/sustainability/reports.html . This report details progress toward our ESG strategies, goals, and initiatives 
and our approach toward industry leadership in ESG to support our strategy and values. Information in our ESG Report is not 
incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report.
We remain committed to helping lift local economies by investing in people and communities where we live and work. In the U.S., 
this includes seeking diverse suppliers and strengthening our supply chain by sourcing from small, minority-, and women-owned 
businesses. We are also proud of our long-standing history of supporting and fostering relationships with organizations that are 
working to make our society more equitable and just, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the 
National Civil Rights Museum. 
Human Resource Management
Our Culture
 
At FedEx, it is our people—our greatest asset—that stand at the heart of our success and are the foundation of our strong reputation. 
Our exemplary human network defines who we are and what kind of business we want to be. Ultimately, our success depends on our 
people’s talent, dedication, and well-being. We strive to recruit, retain, develop, and support our team members as we grow globally. 
The Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and discusses with management our key 
human resource management strategies and programs, including company culture and diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”).
- 5 - 
Throughout our 50-year history, the FedEx culture has driven our success. Our five culture values —take care of each other, commit to 
do good, drive business results, own outstanding, and create what’s next —unify all our operating companies and empower us to 
support our strategy and values. These values are grounded in our Quality Driven Management system, the Purple Promise to make 
every FedEx experience outstanding, and our People–Service–Profit philosophy, which we bring to life by: 
•     Prioritizing safety.
•     Taking care of our team members.
•     Embracing DEI so everyone feels appreciated and valued.
•     Delivering excellence and value for our customers and stockholders.
•     Acting with integrity in all that we do.
•     Supporting our communities.
•     Helping shape a better world.
•     Growing profitably to reinvest in our team members and business.
Ultimately, our success depends on the talent, dedication, and well-being of our people. As we grow, we strive to recruit, retain, 
develop, and provide advancement opportunities for our team members. We continually work to make FedEx an inclusive, equitable, 
and growth-focused workplace where all team members have the opportunity to flourish.
Health and Safety
 
Our highest priority is the well-being, health, and safety of all our employees. Our “Safety Above All” philosophy is the first and 
foremost value in every aspect of our business and is key to maintaining a successful and safe business. Our detailed safety policies, 
education, and technology investments are embedded into our day-to-day work and help us follow through on our commitment to 
make our workplaces and communities safer for our team members, customers, and communities. The Governance, Safety, and Public 
Policy Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our safety strategies, policies, programs, and practices. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Creates Opportunity
 
We believe that DEI delivers a better future for all team members, customers, suppliers, and 
communities. As a global business, we value the diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and 
experiences of our people and recognize DEI is essential to our success and the communities 
we serve. DEI fosters collaboration, enables us to recruit, retain, and develop a talented 
workforce, and underpins our business performance and sustainability. The continued 
integration of DEI into our business strategies and progress towards our DEI objectives 
supported our ability to respond to the challenging labor market our industry faced in recent 
years.
 
FedEx has a long-standing commitment to fully embrace DEI throughout our organization, 
from the Board of Directors to every employee. This commitment is communicated through 
our DEI framework and four strategic pillars: Our People; Our Education and Engagement; 
Our Communities, Customers, and Suppliers; and Our Story. We continue to roll out 
programs to ensure our people are engaged and can develop at FedEx. The FedEx Ground 
workforce career track program, Purple Pathways, directly targets our most diverse 
population, frontline managers and package handlers, to support their career growth.
 
To further our transparency efforts regarding our workforce composition, we report the prior 
year’s gender, racial, and ethnic composition of our U.S. workforce by EEO-1 job category, 
as set forth in the consolidated EEO-1 Reports filed by FedEx and its operating subsidiaries 
with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. These reports can be found on our 
DEI webpage at fedex.com/en-us/about/diversity-inclusion.html .
Quality of Life
 
To support the well-being of our employees and their families, we provide the resources they 
need to thrive at work and at home. All eligible full- and part-time team members are

to them, and provide 24/7 confidential counseling services to support the mental health and well-being of our employees and their 
household members. We frequently communicate with employees on how to access these resources to promote their use across the 
enterprise, with an increased focus on mental health resources in recent years.
Learning and Development
 
At FedEx, we are committed to helping our team members grow and further develop their careers. We proactively evolve our 
operating companies’ learning frameworks to meet emerging trends and align existing competencies to future capabilities and skillsets 
to future-proof talent needs. Our learning and development opportunities increase team member engagement, improve retention, and 
enhance the employee value proposition. Across the enterprise, we tailor our Core New Employee Orientation to best fit team member 
responsibilities in their local workplace. This onboarding experience covers topics such as safety, security, compliance, sustainability, 
and DEI. After orientation, the FedEx Learning Center is available with more than 25,000 online courses to enable a more efficient 
and convenient learning experience.
 
We are committed to supporting team members who wish to pursue higher education in a variety of ways. The Learning inspired by 
FedEx (LiFE) program — a partnership between multiple FedEx operating companies and The University of Memphis—offers a suite 
of education benefits, including tuition-free, fully online degree options for over 30 associate’s and bachelor’s programs of study. 
Eligible employees include all FedEx Express employees at all hub and airport locations in the U.S. as well as all U.S.-based FedEx 
Logistics and FedEx Freight employees and all Memphis-based FedEx Supply Chain employees. In 2022, we expanded the LiFE 
program to include all majors The University of Memphis offers online and added mentoring opportunities. We are exploring 
opportunities to implement similar programs outside the U.S.
 
Talent Acquisition, Engagement, and Turnover
 
Our recruiting practices enable us to build a talented employee base representative of the communities we serve. We continue to refine 
our approach to talent acquisition through technology and other human resource management strategies, leveraging technology to 
make our hiring process more efficient. We value feedback from our team members and provide several avenues of engagement, such 
as annual surveys, employee networks, and direct feedback. These methods allow us to better understand employee concerns and 
expectations, and results from these engagements inform our future strategies. Annually, we conduct an engagement survey to 
measure employee insights on our culture, engagement, and diversity.
 
We work to provide employees with flexible work structures. Depending on the operating company and team member responsibilities, 
we use a flexible work model that allows our people to work in ways that make the most sense to them. We are constantly monitoring 
and adjusting our strategy as we learn of new developments and use survey data at the local, national, and enterprise levels to inform 
our strategy. 
 
Globally, in 2022, we hired over 558,000 full- and part-time team members. Turnover for part-time team members, primarily package 
handlers at our sorting locations, was 205%, while full-time team member turnover was 32% in 2023. Turnover rates among part-time 
frontline workers in a number of industries are historically higher than among other employee groups. Within the ground 
transportation industry, many part-time workers pursue temporary employment opportunities that allow them to exit and re-enter the 
workforce more frequently based on their needs. These traditionally higher rates have recently been further exacerbated by the highly 
competitive labor market.
 
Other Information
 
As of May 31, 2023, FedEx employed approximately 328,000 permanent full-time and approximately 201,000 permanent part-time 
employees, and FedEx Ground utilized nearly 7,000 contracted service providers.
 
The pilots at FedEx Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, 
International (“ALPA”) and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect on November 2, 2015. The 
agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for a successor agreement began in May 2021, and in November 2022 
the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) began actively mediating the negotiations. In May 2023, FedEx Express reached a tentative 
successor agreement with ALPA. The tentative agreement was approved by ALPA’s FedEx Express Master Executive Council in June 
2023 and is being presented to FedEx Express’s pilots for ratification during the first quarter of 2024. The ongoing ratification process 
has no effect on our operations.

A small number of our other employees are members of unions. For additional information, see “FedEx Express Segment” and 
“Regulation” below and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Our Community 
FedEx is committed to actively supporting the communities we serve worldwide through the strategic investment of our people, 
resources, and network. Through FedEx Cares, our global community engagement program, we support non-profit organizations 
working to solve social challenges relevant to our business, customers, and team members. We pair donations with charitable shipping 
and access to our global network, team member volunteers, subject matter expertise, influence, and connections to meet social and 
business goals. We make our biggest investments in areas where we can address significant issues and apply our unique business 
capabilities. Real change takes significant investment, authentic support for communities, and a commitment to continuous learning. 
FedEx Cares focuses on three major giving pillars:
•   Delivering for Good : Lending our global network and unparalleled logistics expertise to organizations with mission-critical 
needs in times of disaster and helping communities heal, learn, and thrive. 
•    Global Entrepreneurship : Advancing women and minority-owned small businesses globally through training and increased 
access to resources, capital, and new markets.
•    Sustainable Logistics : Accelerating process innovations such as public transportation and technological innovations such as 
natural carbon capture and clean energy to reduce the environmental impact of the logistics industry. 
Additionally, our commitments to DEI and team member volunteerism are foundational to FedEx Cares.
In 2023 we exceeded our FedEx Cares 50 by 50 goal of positively impacting 50 million people around the world by our 50th 
anniversary in April 2023. We also launched a “50 Days of Caring” initiative leading up to the anniversary during which FedEx team 
members gave back to their communities through service projects around the world and created the FedEx Founder’s Fund — a 
philanthropic endowment honoring Frederick W. Smith and his legacy as a business leader and changemaker in communities around 
the world. Additionally, FedEx supports communities throughout the U.S. with its FedEx Cares Employee Giving program. 
We believe the investments we make in our communities today, combined with team member engagement, set the stage for a brighter 
tomorrow. For additional information on our community involvement and our FedEx Cares strategy, visit fedexcares.com .
The Environment 
Our “Practical Sustainability” philosophy and “Reduce, Replace, Revolutionize” approach guide our sustainability strategy. At FedEx, 
we recognize our business’s effect on the environment and communities we serve, including greenhouse gas (“GHG”) criteria air 
pollutant emissions, noise pollution, and waste generation from packaging, and remain steadfast in our commitment to minimize these 
impacts. We are also cognizant of the effect climate change could have on our business operations. In our business planning and 
strategy, we consider events such as intensified weather, GHG emissions regulations, increased media and investor attention, and 
enhanced customer demands to address environmental challenges. FedEx has 50 years of experience proactively addressing 
unexpected situations, such as severe weather events, and we maintain system flexibility to minimize impacts on our customers. While 
climate change poses a strategic risk to our business and stakeholders, we recognize the opportunities it simultaneously creates around 
sustainable products and services that advance our customers’ environmental goals. 
We align our assessment and reporting approach with the recommendations from the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Our approach is informed by the climate-
related physical and transition risks we identify through our enterprise risk management process. Climate change-related risks and 
opportunities are assessed as part of our annual risk assessment process, and we continue to closely monitor public attitudes, 
geopolitical concerns, and global regulations.
In 2021 we announced our goal to achieve carbon neutrality by calendar 2040 across our global operations’ Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG 
emissions and our Scope 3 contracted transportation emissions. To help reach this goal, we designated $2.0 billion of initial 
investment towards vehicle electrification, sustainable energy, and carbon sequestration, including a pledge of $100 million to Yale 
University to help establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture. In addition, we continue to leverage other approaches to 
reduce aircraft and vehicle emissions, such as increased interline usage at FedEx Express and intermodal rail usage at FedEx Ground 
and FedEx Freight.
- 8 -Vehicle Electrification
Electrifying a substantial portion of our global fleet of motorized vehicles is a crucial component of our path to carbon-neutral 
operations. We plan to transition the entire FedEx parcel pickup-and-delivery fleet to zero-tailpipe emissions electric vehicles by 
calendar 2040, using a phased approach to replace existing vehicles. For example, by calendar 2025, we expect 50% of FedEx Express 
global pickup-and-delivery vehicle purchases will be electric, rising to 100% of all purchases by calendar 2030, subject to availability. 
FedEx Express continues to expand its electric vehicle fleet through its relationship with General Motors’ BrightDrop, and has taken 
delivery of 500 BrightDrop electric vehicles as of June 2023. FedEx Ground is developing a comprehensive strategy to facilitate the 
electric vehicle transition for our independent service providers, and is implementing the necessary infrastructure at our facilities to 
provide charging solutions. Additionally, FedEx Freight is evaluating electric vehicle opportunities to define scalable solutions for its 
entire fleet.
We are actively building the innovative charging infrastructure required to support our growing fleet of electric vehicles across our 
vast network of facilities, and continue to electrify forklifts, airport ground service equipment, and other non-road vehicles across our 
operating companies to reduce fuel and maintenance costs. We understand that challenges remain, including electric vehicle 
availability, electrification of certain vehicle classes due to operational needs, legislative changes, grid capacity, and certain operating 
conditions. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. 
Fleet efficiency enables ongoing fuel, emissions, and cost reductions as the industry works to address these challenges. FedEx Express 
has established a goal to increase vehicle fleet efficiency by 50% from a 2005 baseline by calendar 2025. Through 2022, our efforts 
collectively resulted in a 40% improvement in FedEx Express vehicle fleet efficiency from our 2005 baseline. 
Sustainable Fuels
To reduce aircraft and vehicle emissions, we continue to pursue viable, cost-effective alternative fuels. Our global fleet of over 6,200 
alternative fuel vehicles includes hybrid, electric, liquified or compressed natural gas, liquified petroleum gas, and hydrogen fuel cell 
vehicles, and we will continue to grow our alternative fuel fleet in the coming years, subject to availability. Decarbonizing 
heavyweight transportation is more challenging than parcel pickup-and-delivery vehicles due to the required mileage range and the 
time needed to refuel or charge. We continue to explore alternative fuels for certain vehicles not easily electrifiable. 
We have also established a goal of obtaining 30% of our annual jet fuel usage from blends of alternative fuels by calendar 2030. The 
U.S. government has passed legislation in recent years to incentivize production, and the EU recently adopted legislation 
implementing sustainable aviation fuel mandates. We understand the challenges the industry faces in deploying sustainable aviation 
fuel at scale and recognize other solutions may be needed to help the aviation industry improve efficiency and reduce emissions. To 
help accelerate solutions, we are members of the First Movers Coalition, participating in the Aviation Sector working group, a global 
initiative working to decarbonize hard-to-abate industrial sectors, including the aviation industry.
Aircraft Fuel Conservation and Fleet Modernization
We continuously work to reduce the environmental impact of our aircraft fleet. Since 2005, we reduced our overall aircraft emissions 
intensity by 28%, primarily due to our ongoing FedEx Fuel Sense and aircraft modernization initiatives. Our global FedEx Fuel Sense 
program, which accounted for 13 million gallons of jet fuel savings in 2022, enables us to reduce the cost of fuel use and associated 
GHG emissions. 
Additionally, our commitment to modernizing our aircraft fleet lowers costs, enhances reliability and operational adaptability, 
improves fuel efficiency, and reduces emissions intensity. During 2023, we retired our MD-10-30 fleet and accelerated the retirement 
of our MD-11 fleet to the end of 2028. See the “Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Goodwill and Other 
Asset Impairment Charges” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial 
Condition” of this Annual Report for more information on aircraft retirements during 2023. 
We took delivery of two Boeing 777 Freighter (“B777F”) aircraft in 2023, and plan to deploy an additional six B777F aircraft during 
2024 and 2025. Similarly, we took delivery of 14 Boeing 767-300 Freighter (“B767F”) aircraft in 2023, and plan to deploy an 
additional 24 B767F aircraft during 2024 and 2025. Delays could impact these timelines. We also continue to deploy new ATR 72-
600F aircraft for shorter feeder routes to replace our aging ATR-42 aircraft and Cessna SkyCourier 408 cargo aircraft to help reduce 
the number of planes needed per feeder route and further improve our fuel efficiency. For more information about our expected future 
aircraft deliveries, see “Item 2. Properties” of this Annual Report under the caption “FedEx Express Segment” and Note 17 of the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements.
- 9 -Facilities
We aim to continuously improve the sustainability, reduce the environmental impact, and increase the efficiency of our more than 
5,000 air and ground hubs, local stations, freight service centers, and retail locations. While our energy demand is increasing to 
support electric vehicle deployment and charging infrastructure, we have increased our focus on facility energy management and off-
site renewable energy procurement strategies to overcome this challenge. Energy management systems are essential to increasing 
efficiency at our facilities through monitoring, regulating, and optimizing our lighting, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning 
equipment. In 2022, we generated on- and off-site solar energy at 29 locations across our operating companies. 
We adopt the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) standard in the U.S. and the Building Research 
Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (“BREEAM”) in Europe to guide efficient facility design when appropriate. FedEx 
Express and FedEx Freight seek LEED certification on all new construction, and in total FedEx has 44 LEED-certified facilities and 
13 BREEAM-certified facilities across our operating companies. 
To reduce our operational waste footprint, we implement waste and recycling management processes in the U.S. We prioritize 
reducing our waste generation and recycling the waste we do produce.
Sustainable Customer Solutions
FedEx works to minimize packaging materials, optimize customer package size and weight, increase shipping efficiency, and 
maximize recyclability to reduce the environmental impacts of packaging materials and transporting goods. We offer end-to-end 
sustainability for customers by supplying sustainable packaging solutions and exploring carbon-neutral shipping opportunities. FedEx-
branded cardboard packaging is 100% recyclable and contains an average of 36% recycled content. During 2022, 64% of FedEx-
branded packaging was third-party certified and all paper purchased by FedEx Office was from vendors with responsible forest-
management practices.
In 2023, we introduced the FedEx Sustainability Insights tool in the U.S., which built upon our previous Customer Emissions 
Calculator, to increase accessibility for our customers and suppliers to estimate CO 2e shipping emissions at package and account 
levels. Created by FedEx Dataworks, this cloud-based engine uses near-real time FedEx network data to estimate CO 2e emissions for 
both individual tracking numbers and fedex.com accounts. Users can view historical emissions data by account as well as search by 
tracking number with their fedex.com  login. 
For additional information on the ways we are minimizing our impact on the environment, see fedex.com/en-us/sustainability.html .
Governance 
The FedEx Board of Directors is comprised of a majority of independent directors and is committed to the highest quality corporate 
governance and accountability to stockholders. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews all aspects of our governance policies and 
practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) and our Code of Conduct, in light of best practices and 
makes whatever changes it deems appropriate to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate 
governance. The Guidelines and the Code of Conduct, which apply to all of our directors, officers, and employees, including our 
principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available under the ESG heading under “Governance” on the Investor 
Relations page of our website at investors.fedex.com . We will post under the ESG heading on the Investor Relations page of our 
website information regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code of Conduct to the extent such disclosure 
is required. 
Business Segments 
The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our principal operating segments: 
FedEx Express Segment 
FedEx Express 
Overview 
FedEx Express invented express distribution 50 years ago in 1973 and remains the industry leader, providing rapid, reliable, time-
definite delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through an integrated global network. 
 
- 10 -FedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight, 
connecting markets that generate more than 99% of the world’s gross domestic product through door-to-door, customs-cleared service, 
historically with a money-back guarantee. As of July 13, 2023, the money-back guarantee remains suspended for certain FedEx 
Express services in order to balance our focus on service and safety. FedEx Express’s unmatched air route authorities and extensive 
transportation infrastructure, combined with leading-edge information technologies, make it the world’s largest express transportation 
company. As of May 31, 2023, FedEx Express employed approximately 245,000 employees and had approximately 70,000 drop-off 
locations (including FedEx Office stores and FedEx OnSite locations, such as nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and 
Albertsons stores), 700 aircraft, and more than 82,000 vehicles in its global network.
FedEx Express also provides time-critical shipment services through FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. (“FedEx Custom Critical”) and 
cross-border enablement and technology solutions and e-commerce transportation solutions.
Services 
FedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. FedEx 
Express offers three U.S. domestic overnight package delivery services: FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight, and FedEx 
Standard Overnight. FedEx SameDay service is available 365 days a year throughout all 50 states for urgent shipments up to 150 
pounds. FedEx Express also offers U.S. express overnight and deferred freight services to handle the needs of the time-definite freight 
market. 
International express and deferred package delivery is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of time-
definite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx International Economy provides time-definite delivery typically in two to five 
business days. FedEx International First provides time-definite delivery to select postal codes in more than 25 countries and territories, 
with delivery to select U.S. ZIP Codes as early as 8:00 a.m. from more than 90 countries and Caribbean islands in one or two business 
days, delivery by 10:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Canada, and by 11:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to

service currently available from nearly 60 origin countries to over 195 destination countries, provides day-definite delivery typically 
within two to five business days.
For information regarding FedEx Express e-commerce tools and solutions, such as FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns 
Technology, see “FedEx Services Segment — Customer-Driven Technology — E-Commerce Solutions.” 
International Expansion 
Over the years, FedEx Express has added capabilities in important international markets that have given us more robust transportation 
networks. Our 2016 acquisition of TNT Express accelerated our European and global growth; substantially enhanced our global 
footprint through TNT Express’s lower-cost road networks in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia; and expanded our capabilities and 
solutions for our customers. The completion of the physical network integration of TNT Express into FedEx Express in 2022 and 
consolidation of flights into our Paris hub allow us to significantly improve operational efficiency, and the reopening and completion 
of central European road hubs in Duiven, The Netherlands and Novara, Italy in 2023 have improved our intra-European service. 
We also have expanded our capabilities in the Asia-Pacific markets, including through the establishment of our Asia-Pacific hub at the 
Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in southern China; our North Pacific regional hub at the Kansai International Airport in 
Osaka, Japan, which serves as a consolidation point for shipments from northern Asia to the U.S.; and our International Express and 
Cargo Hub in Shanghai at Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport. During 2020, we added 14 new Asia-Pacific origin markets for 
FedEx International First service to the U.S. and Canada. These developments allow us to continue to better serve our global 
customers doing business in the Asia-Pacific markets. In 2022, FedEx Express entered into a strategic alliance with Delhivery, a 
leading logistics and supply chain services company in India. 
To facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a variety 
of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements.
- 11 -U.S. Postal Service Agreement 
Pursuant to an agreement with the U.S. Postal Service (“USPS”) that expires on September 29, 2024, FedEx Express provides airport-
to-airport transportation of USPS First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail within the U.S. FedEx Express also 
provides transportation and delivery for the USPS’s international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed under a separate 
agreement. For more information about our relationship with the USPS, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. 
Pricing 
FedEx Express periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guides. In general, 
shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the 
customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective January 2, 2023, FedEx Express implemented a 6.9% average list price 
increase for U.S. domestic, U.S. export, and U.S. import services. 
In order to manage demand and capacity constraints in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, between April 2020 and November 
2020 FedEx Express implemented temporary surcharges on all international package and airfreight shipments. These surcharges 
continued as peak surcharges beginning in November 2020 and remain in effect. Additionally, beginning in June 2020 FedEx Express 
has implemented a series of peak surcharges generally applying to U.S. domestic shipments that are oversized or require additional 
handling, and to residential packages for customers meeting a certain volume threshold. Specific applicable surcharges have been 
adjusted periodically since their implementation, and higher surcharges were applied during the 2023 holiday peak season. Effective 
January 16, 2023, the U.S. domestic holiday peak surcharges were no longer in effect for residential shipments, and peak surcharges 
for shipments that are oversized or require additional handling were adjusted downward. 
FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating 
internationally, where legally and contractually possible. FedEx Express fuel surcharges are adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel 
surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from ten days prior to the week in which it is assessed. Effective April 4, 2022, the tables 
used to determine U.S. domestic fuel surcharges at FedEx Express were updated. Effective January 30, 2023, the tables used to 
determine certain international fuel surcharges at FedEx Express were updated. See the “Results of Operations and Outlook — 
Consolidated Results — Fuel” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial 
Condition” of this Annual Report for more information. 
Operations 
FedEx Express’s primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company’s multiple hub-and-spoke system. 
A second national hub facility is located in Indianapolis. We are making investments over multiple years in our facilities to expand 
and modernize our Indianapolis hub and modernize our Memphis World Hub. See the “Financial Condition — Liquidity Outlook” 
section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report 
for more information. In addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in Fort Worth, Newark, Oakland, and 
Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Chicago and Los Angeles. 
Facilities in Anchorage, Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou, and Osaka serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic 
moving to and from Asia, Europe, and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita 
Airport in Tokyo and Stansted Airport outside London. The facilities in Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou, and Osaka are also designed to 
serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami — the Miami Gateway Hub — serves our South Florida, 
Latin American, and Caribbean markets. A central air hub near Liege, Belgium connects specific large European markets. In addition 
to its worldwide air network, FedEx Express operates road networks in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and 
South America. FedEx Express’s unique European road network connects more than 45 countries and territories through 28 transit 
hubs and more than 700 stations. 
Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo 
handlers, and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station’s service area. In some international areas, independent agents 
(“Global Service Participants”) have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our 
sorting and handling facilities, see “Item 2. Properties” of this Annual Report under the caption “FedEx Express Segment.” 
In connection with our DRIVE initiatives and through collaborations with FedEx Dataworks, we are transforming and optimizing the 
FedEx Express network to be more agile and efficient, including through the deployment of digital assets that allow us to more 
effectively balance the use of FedEx aircraft and Global Service Participants and implementation of a single daily dispatch of couriers 
within the U.S. domestic network.
- 12 -FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its retail locations. FedEx Express also has alliances with 
certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites, including at nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores. 
Our unstaffed FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers, and 
corporate or industrial parks.
Fuel Supplies and Costs 
During 2023, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for 
estimated amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices. We do not have any 
jet fuel hedging contracts. See “Pricing” above. 
The following table sets forth FedEx Express’s costs for jet fuel and its percentage of FedEx Corporation consolidated revenues for 
the last five fiscal years:  
Fiscal YearTotal Jet
Fuel Cost
(in millions)Percentage of 
Consolidated
Revenue
2023 $ 4,515 5.0%
2022 3,867 4.1
2021 2,065 2.5
2020 2,265 3.3
2019 2,847 4.1
Most of FedEx Express’s vehicle fuel needs are satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts. 
Competition 
As described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report, the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive 
and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. The ability to compete effectively 
depends upon price, frequency, reliability, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic 
coverage, innovative service offerings, and the fit within the customer’s overall supply chain. 
Competitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. (“UPS”), passenger 
airlines offering express package services, regional delivery companies, air freight forwarders, and the USPS. FedEx Express’s 
principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, DPD (a subsidiary of France’s La Poste’s GeoPost), General Logistics Systems (a 
Royal Mail-owned parcel delivery group), foreign postal authorities, passenger airlines, air freight forwarders, regional carriers, and 
all-cargo airlines. FedEx Express also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local 
market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house 
delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, and may be considered competitors. For example, 
Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery 
capabilities broadly to third parties. Many of FedEx Express’s international competitors are government-owned, -controlled, or -
subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity, and more favorable operating conditions 
than FedEx Express. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
Employees 
John A. Smith is the President and Chief Executive Officer — U.S. and Canada Ground Operations of FedEx Express and Richard W. 
Smith is the President and Chief Executive Officer — Airline and International of FedEx Express. As of May 31, 2023, FedEx 
Express employed approximately 188,000 permanent full-time and approximately 56,000 permanent part-time employees. 
 
The pilots of FedEx Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by ALPA and are employed under a 
collective bargaining agreement that took effect in November 2015. The collective bargaining agreement became amendable in 
November 2021. Bargaining for a successor agreement began in May 2021, and in November 2022 the NMB began actively 
mediating the negotiations. In May 2023, FedEx Express reached a tentative successor agreement with ALPA. The tentative 
agreement was approved by ALPA’s FedEx Express Master Executive Council in June 2023 and is being presented to FedEx 
Express’s pilots for ratification during the first quarter of 2024. The ongoing ratification process has no effect on our operations.
 
- 13 -In addition to our pilots at FedEx Express, certain of FedEx Express’s non-U.S. employees are unionized. In June 2022, the Transport 
Workers Union filed an application with the NMB requesting an election to represent approximately 130 Global Operations Control 
(“GOC”) specialists who perform flight dispatching functions in FedEx Express’s GOC center. The NMB dismissed the application in 
December 2022. FedEx Express believes its employee relations are excellent. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report for 
more information.

FedEx Ground Segment 
Overview
By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low-cost structure, and efficiently using information technology and advanced 
automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential 
ground package delivery services. As of July 13, 2023, the money-back guarantee for all FedEx Ground services remains suspended in 
order to balance our focus on service and safety. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, 
focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the 
continental U.S. population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental U.S. population. Service is also 
provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through a ground 
and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers. FedEx Ground provides seven-day-per-week residential 
delivery to more than half of the U.S. population. See “One FedEx and Network 2.0” above for information regarding the transition of 
all FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to FedEx Express beginning in April 2024.
The company offers FedEx Home Delivery service, which reaches 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated to 
meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as 
day-specific, appointment, and signature delivery. Sunday delivery is provided for more than half of the U.S. population. FedEx Home 
Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their customers and is the first residential ground package delivery 
service to have offered a money-back guarantee. FedEx Ground Economy service is available for the consolidation and delivery of 
high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages to any residential address or PO Box in the U.S. 
Pricing
FedEx Ground periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, U.S. 
shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the 
customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective January 2, 2023, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery 
implemented a 6.9% average list price increase. FedEx Ground Economy average list prices also increased.
To manage demand and capacity constraints in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in June 2020 FedEx Ground 
implemented a series of surcharges generally applying to shipments that are oversized, unauthorized, or require additional handling; to 
residential packages for customers meeting a certain volume threshold; and to FedEx Ground Economy shipments. Specific applicable 
surcharges have been adjusted periodically since their implementation, and higher surcharges were applied during the 2023 holiday 
peak season. Effective January 16, 2023, the holiday peak surcharges were no longer in effect for residential shipments, and peak 
surcharges for shipments that are oversized or require additional handling were adjusted downward. 
FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price 
from two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed. Effective April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at 
FedEx Ground were updated. See the “Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Fuel” section of “Item 7. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more 
information.
- 14 -Operations
FedEx Ground operates a highly flexible network of over 700 sortation and distribution facilities, including more than 160 fully 
automated stations, in the U.S. and Canada as of May 31, 2023. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with more than 
100,000 vehicles owned or leased by independent service providers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service and FedEx Ground 
Economy service, FedEx Ground leverages its pickup operation and hub and linehaul network.
Following a network expansion in recent years that substantially increased FedEx Ground’s daily capacity through the addition of new 
facilities featuring the latest automated sorting technology as well as the expansion or relocation of existing hubs and other facilities, 
in 2023 the company rationalized its operations in response to lower volumes by consolidating sorts and cancelling several planned 
network capacity projects, continuing to manage staffing levels effectively, and reducing Sunday delivery operations. 
FedEx Ground continues to leverage opportunities to maximize utilization of existing facilities and deploy new technologies to 
enhance operational efficiency. Advanced automated unloading and sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of millions 
of packages daily. FedEx Ground yard management systems, which interact with GPS tags on each trailer and create geofences around 
FedEx Ground facilities, automatically notify the control center when a trailer arrives and departs. Using overhead laser and six-sided 
camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute, where 
they are loaded for transport to their respective destination stations for local delivery. 
Through collaboration with FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Ground is implementing dynamic scheduling tools to match sort staffing 
headcount with volumes and is introducing capabilities to allow certain packages to bypass station sortation and proceed directly to 
vehicles, which helps to maximize station capacity. Dock modernization efforts enabled by FedEx Dataworks, including a new 
network operating plan that uses machine learning and algorithms to develop more detailed and accurate volume forecasts, are 
enhancing productivity at FedEx Ground in furtherance of our DRIVE initiatives. Additionally, the company is testing autonomous, 
driverless technologies in the handling of large, non-conveyable packages, as well as artificial intelligence-enabled robotic product 
sortation systems to sort small packages.
Advanced route optimization technology leveraging the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks provides service providers near real-time 
data that can be used to plan efficient delivery routes and make decisions about vehicle mix and workforce. Additionally, software 
systems and internet-based applications are deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external 
delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx 
website, fedex.com . For additional information regarding FedEx Ground e-commerce tools and solutions, including FedEx Delivery 
Manager and FedEx Returns Technology, see “FedEx Services Segment — Customer-Driven Technology — E-Commerce 
Solutions.” 
FedEx Ground has introduced new vehicle safety technologies and incentives for adoption by its service providers, as well as new 
eligibility standards for drivers employed by service providers. Additionally, FedEx Ground has made significant operational 
enhancements to ensure safe and reliable handling of large and heavy items. These changes include designing new facilities, adding 
equipment to certain facilities, and making other operational adjustments. 
FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its retail locations. FedEx Ground is also available as a 
service option at all FedEx Authorized ShipCenters and other FedEx OnSite locations, including at nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar 
General, and Albertsons stores.  
As of May 31, 2023, FedEx Ground employed approximately 56,000 permanent full-time and approximately 136,000 permanent part-
time employees. In addition, FedEx Ground contracts with nearly 7,000 independent small businesses to conduct its linehaul and 
pickup-and-delivery operations, as the use of these service providers is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business and its 
customers. 
FedEx Ground is defending lawsuits in which it is alleged that FedEx Ground should be treated as an employer or joint employer of 
drivers employed by service providers engaged by FedEx Ground. We continue to believe that FedEx Ground is not an employer or 
joint employer of the drivers of these independent businesses. The status of the drivers employed by these service providers could be 
further challenged in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan. For a description of these proceedings, see “Item 1A. Risk 
Factors” of this Annual Report and Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.
- 15 -Scott L. Ray is the President of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, and its primary 
competitors are UPS, the USPS, and regional delivery carriers. FedEx Ground also competes with startup companies that combine 
technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as 
Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries. For 
example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery 
capabilities broadly to third parties. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
FedEx Freight Segment
Overview
FedEx Freight is a leading North American provider of LTL freight services, offering choice, simplicity, and reliability to meet the 
needs of LTL shippers — FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet a customer’s supply chain needs; FedEx Freight 
Economy, when a customer can trade time for cost savings; and FedEx Freight Direct, a service to meet the needs of the growing e-
commerce market for delivery of big and bulky products to or through the door for residences and businesses. Through one 
comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems, FedEx Freight provides service to virtually every U.S. 
ZIP Code (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading transit times. FedEx Freight Priority has the fastest published transit 
times of any nationwide LTL service. Internationally, FedEx Freight Canada offers FedEx Freight Priority service, serving most points 
in Canada, as well as FedEx Freight Priority and FedEx Freight Economy service between Canada and the U.S. In addition, FedEx 
Freight serves Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands via alliances. As of July 13, 2023, the money-back guarantee for all 
FedEx Freight services remains suspended in order to balance our focus on service and safety.
Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match customers’ time-critical needs with industry-leading transit times. With 
the expansion of FedEx electronic solutions, LTL shippers have the convenience of a single shipping and tracking solution for FedEx 
Freight, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. These solutions make freight shipping easier and provide customers easy access to their 
account information. The FedEx Freight Advance Notice feature available on FedEx Freight Priority shipments uses the company’s 
innovative technology systems to proactively notify FedEx Freight customers via the internet, e-mail, or fax when a shipment may be 
delayed beyond its estimated delivery date, providing customers with greater visibility and control of their LTL freight shipments. 
Customers can also process cross-border LTL shipments to and from Canada and Mexico, as well as intra-Canada and -Mexico 
shipments, through FedEx Ship Manager at fedex.com , FedEx Ship Manager Software, FedEx Ship Manager Server, and FedEx Web 
Services. Additionally, FedEx Freight A.M. Delivery offers freight delivery by 10:30 a.m. within and between the U.S. and Canada. 
FedEx Freight also offers LTL Select, a free cloud-based, multi-carrier transportation management system that provides customers 
with visibility into all available carriers and their pricing in one location, as well as the ability to book service and make payments. 
FedEx Freight uses radio frequency identification technology and customized software to improve shipment visibility on its docks and 
enhance custodial control at the handling unit level.
FedEx Freight Direct addresses the growing e-commerce market for big and bulky products. It has four delivery service levels to meet 
customer needs, with basic and basic by appointment to-the-door services available to nearly 100% of the U.S. population and 
standard and premium through-the-door services available to 90% of the continental U.S. population, as well as flexible delivery 
windows, end-to-end visibility, proactive notifications, and returns services with flexible pickup windows and label-less options.
As of May 31, 2023, the FedEx Freight segment was operating nearly 30,000 vehicles from a network of approximately 390 service 
centers and had approximately 43,000 employees. The company plans to close and consolidate approximately 30 locations in the first 
quarter of 2024, and conducted several rounds of furloughs to match staffing with volume levels in 2023. Lance D. Moll is the 
President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Freight, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freight’s primary competitors 
are YRC Worldwide Inc. (which includes YRC Regional Transportation and YRC Freight), XPO Logistics, Inc., Old Dominion 
Freight Line, Inc., ABF Freight (an ArcBest company), SAIA, Inc., and TFI International Inc.
We are currently bargaining with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at one FedEx Freight facility. 
Pricing
FedEx Freight periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its 100 Rules Tariff. In general, 
shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, class, any ancillary service charge, and whether the 
customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. On January 2, 2023, FedEx Freight implemented a 6.9% average list price 
increase for customers who use FXF PZONE and FXF EZONE rates and a 7.9% average list price increase for customers who use 
FXF 1000 and FXF 501. These increases apply for shipments within the U.S. and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada. 
- 16 -In order to manage demand and capacity constraints, beginning in July 2021 FedEx Freight implemented a peak surcharge applying to 
specific delivery points within the U.S. The peak surcharge has been adjusted periodically since implementation. Effective November 
15, 2021, FedEx Freight increased applicable length surcharges. Effective January 17, 2022, FedEx Freight added a surcharge that 
applies when a pickup is performed and no shipment is tendered to the carrier. Effective January 16, 2023, FedEx Freight changed the 
extreme length surcharge to a tier-based length structure. The company continues to explore ways to modernize freight pricing 
including through dimension-in-motion technology, which more accurately captures freight profile and improves its ability to cost and 
price shipments.
FedEx Freight has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price 
from two days prior to the day in which it is assessed. Effective April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at FedEx 
Freight were updated. See the “Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Fuel” section of “Item 7. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more 
information. 
FedEx Services Segment
FedEx Services provides our other companies with sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, 
technical support, billing and collection services, and certain other back-office support. Through FedEx Services, we provide a 
convenient single point of access for many customer support functions, enabling us to more effectively sell the entire portfolio of 
transportation services and to help ensure a consistent and outstanding experience for our customers. 
Brie A. Carere and Robert B. Carter each serve as the Co-President and Co-Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Services, which is based 
in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2023, the FedEx Services segment had approximately 15,000 employees. 
Customer-Driven Technology 
FedEx is a world leader in technology, and FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith’s vision that “the information about a package is as 
important as the delivery of the package itself” remains at the core of our comprehensive technology strategy. We strive to build 
technology solutions that will solve our customers’ business problems with simplicity, convenience, speed, and reliability. 
Additionally, FedEx stands at the nexus of digital and physical networks, a crucial intersection for the success of e-commerce 
deliveries. We continue to expand our e-commerce convenience network and explore innovative alternatives to help customers and 
businesses deliver. During 2023 we continued to advance a major information technology transition from traditional mainframe 
computing to cloud-based systems, which is delivering significant benefits in terms of flexibility, security, speed to market, and 
resiliency. See “FedEx Dataworks Operating Segment” below for more information on the solutions we are creating to “Innovate for 
Tomorrow.”
Shipping Management and Precision Tracking
The fedex.com  website is widely recognized for its speed, ease of use, and customer-focused features. The advanced tracking 
capability within FedEx Tracking provides customers with a consolidated view of inbound and outbound shipments. Additionally, an 
advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence model developed by FedEx Dataworks has enhanced tracking capabilities on 
fedex.com, delivering greater estimated delivery date accuracy, including updates for early or delayed shipments. FedEx Virtual 
Assistant on fedex.com is an artificial-intelligence-enabled service that provides answers to customer shipping questions, allowing our 
customer service representatives and sales professionals to focus on higher-value customer interactions. 
SenseAware, a FedEx innovation currently available in 135 countries worldwide, allows customers to stay connected to their critical 
shipments by providing real-time updates regarding current location, precise temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure 
readings, light exposure, and shock events. Additionally, FedEx SenseAware ID is a lightweight sensor-based logistics device that 
delivers a new level of precision tracking. The enhanced location visibility provided by FedEx SenseAware ID is creating 
opportunities for FedEx customers to reimagine their supply chains through real-time updates on a package’s location within the 
FedEx Express network. FedEx is currently expanding access to FedEx SenseAware ID and plans to eventually make FedEx 
SenseAware ID available for a broad range of premium FedEx Express services.
FedEx Mobile is a suite of solutions including the FedEx mobile application, FedEx mobile website, and SMS text messaging. The 
FedEx Mobile app provides convenience for recipients to track packages and access FedEx Delivery Manager to customize home 
deliveries. Shippers can easily get rates and estimated delivery times and swiftly create a shipping label. All users can quickly find the 
nearest FedEx location for Hold at Location or drop-off. It is available on Android™ and Apple devices. The FedEx Mobile app has 
expanded to more than 220 countries and territories and 40 languages. SMS Notifications allows customers to track or follow a 
package via text messaging, and it is currently available in five countries. 
- 17 -Additionally, our FedEx Ship Manager suite of solutions, which was modernized in 2023, offers a wide range of options to help our 
customers manage their parcel and LTL shipping and associated processes. 
E-Commerce Solutions
FedEx Delivery Manager allows our U.S. residential customers to customize home deliveries to fit their schedule by providing a range 
of options to schedule dates, locations, and times of delivery. Additionally, FedEx Returns Technology, a comprehensive solution for 
returns management, provides high-volume merchants and e-tailers complete visibility into returns and an easy way to track 
shipments, manage inventory, analyze returns trends, and make more informed decisions based on shoppers’ returns behaviors. In 
2023 we launched FedEx Consolidated Returns in the U.S., a low-priced, easy e-commerce solution for low-weight returns facilitated 
through supply chain services offered by FedEx Logistics and FedEx Office. Through FedEx Consolidated Returns, shoppers who 
purchased from participating merchants can drop off the items they wish to return with no box or label required at approximately 
2,000 FedEx Office locations. The returned items will then be consolidated with other returns and processed through FedEx Logistics 
and sent back to the merchants via a less-than-truckload option.
FedEx OnSite, our retail convenience network, utilizes third-party retailers to receive and hold packages for FedEx customers. The 
FedEx OnSite network has grown to include nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores in addition to our 
approximately 2,000 FedEx Office locations. In addition to allowing for an easy returns and drop-off experience for shoppers, the 
FedEx OnSite network is well positioned to serve as a “buy online, pickup in store” network for small and medium merchants without 
brick-and-mortar locations. We have also added FedEx Returns Technology to the Walgreens retail network, which allows for in-store 
printing of return shipping labels and eliminates the need to include a return label in every package.
We have expanded e-commerce delivery options for retailers with FedEx Extra Hours, a service that enables participating retailers to 
fulfill e-commerce orders into the evening and receive late pickups by FedEx Express, with next-day local delivery and two-day 
shipping to any address in the continental U.S. FedEx Extra Hours, which is currently available to select customers, allows retailers to 
extend evening order cutoff times by five to eight hours, with some as late as midnight, depending on their current order fulfillment 
process.
In June 2022, FedEx announced the launch of Picture Proof of Delivery for express and ground residential deliveries in the U.S. and 
Canada that are released without a signature. The capability has expanded to 90% of global residential deliveries.
Through innovative partnerships, FedEx Dataworks seeks to open pathways to e-commerce and empower customers with 
differentiated insights and tools. In 2021, we announced a multi-year collaboration with Adobe, starting with the integration of 
ShopRunner with Adobe Commerce’s Magento platform. By integrating their online storefronts with ShopRunner, Adobe merchants 
are able to offer seamless checkout, two-day shipping, easy returns, and exclusive offers to shippers. The collaboration also gives 
merchants access to FedEx post-purchase logistics intelligence, allowing for better management of supply chains. In 2022, we 
announced a multi-year partnership with Salesforce that integrates Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Salesforce Order Management 
with innovative capabilities from FedEx and ShopRunner. In January 2022, FedEx and Microsoft announced a new cross-platform 
logistics solution for e-commerce aimed at increasing merchant competitiveness in the e-commerce space by improving customer 
engagement and providing enhanced shipping options, which was made available to customers in the U.S. in 2023. Additionally, in 
June 2022 FedEx and FourKites announced a strategic alliance to provide businesses with new, more robust real-time supply chain 
visibility capabilities. In November 2022, we announced a strategic alliance with Cart.com to create integrated solutions that help 
address some of the biggest e-commerce challenges.
Autonomous Solutions
FedEx is exploring the use of autonomous delivery technology within its operations. In 2022, we announced a multi-year, multi-phase 
agreement to test Nuro’s next-generation autonomous delivery vehicle within FedEx operations. The collaboration with Nuro will 
explore various use cases for on-road autonomous vehicle logistics such as multi-stop and appointment-based deliveries. 
In 2022, we began a pilot program with Aurora Innovation, Inc. (“Aurora”) and PACCAR Inc. to test Aurora’s autonomous driving 
technology in PACCAR autonomous vehicle platform-equipped trucks within FedEx linehaul operations. Additionally, FedEx 
Express is developing plans to test Elroy Air’s autonomous air cargo system within the company’s middle-mile logistics operations, 
moving shipments between sortation locations. We are also working with major national retailers, fast food restaurants, and drug 
stores to help assess different customers’ autonomous delivery needs. In 2023, FedEx ended the research and development program 
for Roxo, the FedEx SameDay Bot, to prioritize these other nearer-term opportunities.
- 18 -Marketing
The FedEx brand name symbolizes outstanding service, reliability, and speed. Emphasis is continually placed on promoting and 
protecting the FedEx brand, one of our most important assets. As a result, FedEx is one of the most widely recognized brands in the 
world. In addition to television, print, and digital advertising, we promote the FedEx brand through sponsorships and special events. 
For example, FedEx sponsors:
•     The UEFA Champions League, which is broadcast in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.
•     The season-long FedExCup competition on the PGA Tour, and the FedEx St. Jude Championship, a PGA Tour event that 
has raised millions of dollars for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and is one of three annual FedExCup playoff events.
•     The #11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota Camry driven by Denny Hamlin in the NASCAR Cup Series.
Additionally, FedEx is the “Official Delivery Service Sponsor” and “Official Office Services Provider” of the NFL, through which we 
conduct events and other activities to promote the FedEx brand, such as the “FedEx Air & Ground” NFL Players of the Week and 
Players of the Year Awards.
Information Security
FedEx Services has a team of highly qualified professionals dedicated to securing information about our customers’ shipments and 
protecting our customers’, vendors’, and employees’ privacy, and we strive to provide a safe, secure online environment for our 
customers. We are committed to compliance with applicable information security laws, regulations, and industry standards. For a 
description of risks related to information security, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
FedEx Dataworks Operating Segment
The FedEx Dataworks operating segment is focused on putting our data into context and using it to enhance the efficiency of the 
FedEx network and our customers’ supply chains, as well as the end-to-end experience of our customers. The size and scale of our 
global network gives us a bird’s-eye view of global supply chains and trends and provides an immense amount of data. As the digital 
twin of our physical network and a key enabler of our DRIVE transformation, FedEx Dataworks leverages this information to allow us 
to work differently through a more technology-enabled, data-driven approach. See “FedEx Express Segment — FedEx Express — 
Operations” and “FedEx Ground Segment — Operations” above for information regarding how FedEx Dataworks is enabling the 
transformation and optimization of our physical network at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. FedEx Dataworks is also helping to 
build out a dynamic pricing infrastructure, which enabled 2023 holiday peak residential surcharges to adjust dynamically based on an 
individual customer’s weekly peaking factor, and exploring and implementing ways for predictive anomaly detection to improve 
revenue quality.
FedEx Surround allows business customers to enhance visibility into its supply chain by leveraging data to provide near-real-time 
analytics into shipment tracking, which will drive more precise logistics and inventory management. FedEx Dataworks is helping to 
facilitate an open and collaborative e-commerce ecosystem that helps merchants provide seamless end-to-end experiences for their 
customers. ShopRunner is an e-commerce platform that directly connects brands and merchants with online shoppers. ShopRunner’s 
data-driven marketing and omnichannel enablement capabilities also help brands and merchants acquire high-value customers and 
accelerate their digital innovation by using ShopRunner’s e-commerce platform. We believe the complementary nature of 
ShopRunner’s pre-purchase offerings combined with FedEx’s post-purchase logistics intelligence enables brands and merchants to 
attract and engage consumers at scale by providing innovative online shopping experiences. In November 2022, ShopRunner 
announced the launch of its new mobile application. For additional information regarding FedEx Dataworks e-commerce partnerships, 
tools, and solutions, see “FedEx Services Segment — Customer-Driven Technology — E-Commerce Solutions.”

promotional products marketplace that allows businesses to customize and purchase high-quality promotional products. FedEx Office 
has also made investments in new machines and technology, enhancing capabilities in narrow format color, grand format, large 
format, color management, enhanced finishing, and other technologies.
FedEx Office provides customers convenient access to the full range of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipping services. 
Customers may have their FedEx Express and FedEx Ground packages delivered to any FedEx Office customer-facing location 
nationwide through the Hold at FedEx Location service, free of charge, and may redirect packages to these locations through Redirect 
to Hold or AutoRedirect to Hold services. FedEx Office facilitates e-commerce and returns through FedEx Returns Technology, 
which allows for in-store printing of return shipping labels. Through FedEx Consolidated Returns, which we launched in 2023, 
shoppers who purchased from participating merchants can drop off the items they wish to return with no box or label required at a 
FedEx Office location. For information regarding FedEx Consolidated Returns, see “FedEx Services Segment — Customer-Driven 
Technology — E-Commerce Solutions.” We discontinued FedEx SameDay City operations during 2023.

definite shipping or time-definite global FedEx Express shipping services, FedEx Office offers a complete “pack-and-ship” solution.  
FedEx Office also offers FedEx Pack Plus, which includes custom box building capabilities and techniques; a robust assortment of 
specialty boxes; and additional packing supplies, equipment, and tools to serve our customers’ needs.

courier picks up a customer’s print job at the customer’s location and then returns the finished product to the customer. Options and 
services vary by location.

Trademarks
The “FedEx” trademark, service mark, and trade name are essential to our worldwide business. FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx 
Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Services, FedEx Office, FedEx Logistics, FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Trade Networks Transport & 
Brokerage, FedEx Supply Chain, FedEx Custom Critical, and ShopRunner, among others, are trademarks, service marks, and trade 
names of Federal Express Corporation or the respective companies for which registrations, or applications for registration, are on file, 
as applicable. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks, and trade 
names by our contractors and Global Service Participants to support our business. In addition, we license the use of certain of our 
trademarks, service marks, and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness. 
Regulation  
Air. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the “Federal Aviation Act”), both the U.S. Department of Transportation 
(“DOT”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx Express. 
- 21 -The FAA’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and 
maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its 
aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the 
federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its 
standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations. 
The DOT’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOT’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route 
authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various 
certificates issued by the DOT, authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail 
on a worldwide basis. These certificates will remain in effect as we maintain our economic fitness to perform all-cargo services in 
connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan.
Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), an 
agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires FedEx Express to 
comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. 
These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional 
security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security 
requirements could impose material costs on us. 
FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense 
may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Express’s wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national 
emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard 
contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, 
FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other 
carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. government for such charter flights. 
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report for discussion of regulations related to pilots, including the proposed pilot flight 
and duty time regulations, that could affect our business.
Ground . The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the 
Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes, or services of 
intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx 
Express is registered in those states that require registration. 
The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the 
DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal 
legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates, routes, and services in interstate freight transportation. 
Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations, including those at FedEx Express, are subject to certain DOT safety requirements 
governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.
International . FedEx Express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to 
numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take 
action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. The right of a U.S. carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the 
DOT’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and the foreign government. In addition, the carrier 
must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment 
for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air network in the most efficient 
manner, and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, 
such as FedEx Express, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by U.S. and foreign governments. 
Our operations outside of the U.S., such as FedEx Express’s international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential 
regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult, and sometimes prohibit, the 
ability of foreign-owned companies such as FedEx Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation 
and logistics market. 
- 22 -Communication . Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation 
operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal 
Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulates and licenses FedEx Express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications, and 
also manages the spectrum allocation and licensing process. The FCC recently expanded the use of the 3.7 to 4.2 gigahertz (“GHz”) 
spectrum band, which has historically been reserved for aviation, to support the implementation of “5G” cellular networks across the 
U.S. In December 2021, following concerns of potential interference with aircraft radio altimeters by the expanded use of the 3.7 to 
4.2 GHz spectrum band, the FAA issued airworthiness directives prohibiting U.S. aircraft operators from operating at U.S. airports 
affected by 5G cellular networks without radio altimeter retrofits or other enhancements unless authorized via an alternative means of 
compliance. FedEx Express’s U.S. air operations continued to operate with minimal interruption due to the FAA’s issuance of 
alternative means of compliance while the company modified its fleet to comply with the directives. In June 2022, the FAA 
announced its expectation that U.S. aircraft operators have radio altimeter retrofits or other enhancements in place by July 2023. As of 
July 1, 2023, FedEx Express’s U.S. air operations are in compliance with the airworthiness directives, and we do not expect any 
subsequent operational disruptions from “5G” cellular network implementation.
Environmental . 
Noise : Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), is 
authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx Express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards 
of the federal aviation regulations. In addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local noise 
regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on 
FedEx Express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect in any of FedEx 
Express’s significant markets. Congress’s passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, 
which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Express’s international 
operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates. 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions : Concern over climate change, including the effect of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and 
international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions. 
Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering GHG regulatory requirements. Compliance with such regulation and the 
associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the 
regulation of climate change. In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) formally adopted a global, market-
based emissions offset program known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”). This 
program established a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbon neutral growth in international aviation beginning in calendar 
2021. Any growth above a global industry emissions baseline would need to be addressed using either eligible carbon offset credits or 
qualifying sustainable aviation fuel purchases. The baseline was originally set as an average of calendar 2019 and calendar 2020 
emissions. In 2023, due to the effects of COVID-19 on the airline industry, the ICAO adopted a new baseline of 85% of calendar 2019 
emissions. To date, however, while the U.S. Congress is considering proposals to afford the DOT and FAA full authority to 
implement the market-based measures of CORSIA, the U.S. has not fully implemented CORSIA. In the interim, we continue to 
voluntarily report our emissions data to the FAA.
Other ICAO member states are moving forward with implementing CORSIA, and have taken additional action to reduce aircraft GHG 
emissions. For example, both the EU and the United Kingdom have implemented regulations to include aviation in the Emissions 
Trading Scheme (“ETS”). For the EU, under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the European 
Economic Area (“EEA”) is subject to the ETS. Beginning in calendar 2012, airlines including FedEx were required to purchase 
emissions allowances or, alternatively, purchase qualifying sustainable aviation fuel if they exceeded the number of free allowances 
allocated under the ETS. While the current scope of ETS has been limited to apply only to flights within the EEA through calendar 
2026, the EU adopted legislation in 2023 requiring that a study be conducted in July 2026 reassessing whether the European 
Commission should propose to expand the scope of ETS to include international flights from the EEA based on CORSIA 
implementation and performance.
We expect compliance with CORSIA and the ETS to increase FedEx operating expenses. The amount of such increase will ultimately 
depend on a number of factors, including the number of our flights subject to CORSIA and the ETS, the fuel efficiency of our fleet, 
the average growth of the aviation sector, our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future and the price of such fuels, and 
the price of eligible emission units, offsets, or allowances required to be purchased by FedEx. 
- 23 -Additionally, in 2017, ICAO adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of 
calendar 2020, but also to new deliveries of currently in-production aircraft types from calendar 2023. ICAO established a production 
cutoff date of January 1, 2028 for aircraft that do not comply with these standards. The standards are considered to be especially 
stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons. In 2021, the EPA adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine GHG emissions 
standards, which are aligned with the 2017 ICAO emissions standards, and the FAA is advancing its own conforming rulemaking to 
implement the standards through its aircraft certification process. In the past, the U.S. Congress has also considered bills that would 
regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. In 2021 the U.S. reentered the 
Paris climate accord, an agreement among 197 countries to reduce GHG emissions. The effect of the reentry on future U.S. policy 
regarding GHG emissions and on other GHG regulation is uncertain. Additionally, the extent to which other countries implement that 
agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.
Hazardous Substances : In calendar 2022, the EPA proposed regulations to categorize certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
(“PFAS”) as “hazardous substances” under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(“CERCLA”). Numerous U.S. states, including California, have adopted additional regulations governing these substances. PFAS are 
used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products, including the firefighting foams approved for use by the FAA to 
extinguish fuel-based fires at airports and refineries. The EPA’s proposed rule, once finalized, could subject airports, airlines, and 
refineries to potential liability for cleanup of historical PFAS contamination. We could incur remediation costs for currently and 
formerly operated facilities. While the impact of this rulemaking on our business and results of operations cannot currently be 
predicted, we remain committed to transitioning to PFAS-free materials for fire suppression in accordance with the framework 
outlined by the FAA in May 2023.
We are also subject to international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the 
shipment of dangerous goods and contingency planning for spills of petroleum products. Additionally, we are subject to numerous 
regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise, and 
the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. FedEx Express has an environmental management system based on 
International Standardization 14001 designed to maintain compliance with these regulations and minimize our operational 
environmental footprint, and certified all U.S. airport locations in 2022. 
Export Controls . In recent years, the U.S. government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to U.S. export 
control regulations. Such regulations can restrict the types of items that FedEx customers are permitted to ship to certain entities, and 
in some instances may prohibit FedEx from serving certain entities altogether. Violations of these regulations can result in significant 
monetary and other penalties. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (the “ECRA”) and its implementing regulations, 
the Export Administration Regulations (the “EARs”), hold carriers such as FedEx strictly liable for shipments that may violate the 
EARs without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations. Violations of the ECRA can result in criminal 
penalties of up to $1 million and civil penalties of $305,000 (or twice the value of the transaction) per individual violation. FedEx is 
investing in improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs. However, the heightened focus on export controls 
by the U.S. government increases FedEx’s exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance costs. 
Customs . Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal 
Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding), and the DOT (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar 
regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions. 
Labor . All U.S. employees at FedEx Express are covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the “RLA”), while labor 
relations within the U.S. at our other companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the 
“NLRA”). Under the RLA, groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires 
mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the NMB before a union can strike or an employer can 
replace employees or impose contract terms. This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large 
portions of the economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led mediation is not a 
required step in the negotiation process. 
The RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation systems evolved, the law 
expanded to cover airlines, which are now the dominant national transportation systems. As an air express carrier with an integrated 
air/ground network, FedEx Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the company. The purpose 
of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose) and engage in collective bargaining while also 
protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA ensures that an entire transportation 
system, such as at FedEx Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network. 
- 24 -The U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of 
our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the 
jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the FedEx Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of 
employees could disrupt the entire air/ground network. This jurisdiction could be challenged in connection with our one FedEx 
consolidation plan. In addition, federal and state governmental agencies, such as the NMB and the National Labor Relations Board 
(“NLRB”), have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees, and employees of service providers 
contracting with FedEx Ground, to organize under the RLA or NLRA. For a description of these and other potential labor law 
changes, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
Data Protection . There has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, 
transfer, and processing of personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally. For more information 
regarding data protection regulation, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. 
- 25 -ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could 
materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the price of our common stock. Additional risks not 
currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business, results of operations, 
financial condition, and the price of our common stock.
Macroeconomic and Market Risks
We are directly affected by the state of the global economy and geopolitical developments.  While macroeconomic risks apply to most 
companies, we are particularly vulnerable. The transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in 
economic activity. Our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production 
of goods and the rate of growth of global trade — key macroeconomic measurements influenced by, among other things, inflation and 
deflation, supply chain disruptions, interest rates and currency exchange rates, labor costs and unemployment levels, fuel and energy 
prices, public health crises, inventory levels, buying patterns and disposable income, debt levels, and credit availability. When 
individuals and companies purchase and produce fewer goods, we transport fewer goods, and as companies move manufacturing 
closer to consumer markets and expand the number of distribution centers, we transport goods shorter distances, which adversely 
affects our yields and profitability. Certain manufacturers and retailers are making investments to produce and house goods in closer 
proximity to supply chains and consumers in connection with recent macroeconomic, geopolitical, and public health developments. 
Additionally, consumer spending has shifted from goods to services, and in 2023 we saw a customer preference for slower, less costly 
shipping services. We expect these trends to continue. Further, the scale of our operations and our relatively high fixed-cost structure, 
particularly at FedEx Express, make it difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels, which negatively affected our results 
of operations in 2023. For more information, see “Our businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital decisions based 
upon projected volume levels.” below. 
Our results in 2023 were adversely impacted by lower global volumes due to weak economic conditions. We are experiencing a 
decline in demand for our transportation services as inflation and interest rate increases are negatively affecting consumer and 
business spending. Additionally, we are experiencing higher costs to serve through higher fuel prices, wage rates, purchased 
transportation costs, and other direct operating expenses such as operational supplies. During 2024, we expect macroeconomic 
conditions to continue to negatively affect customer demand for our services. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for additional information.
Moreover, given the nature of our business and our global operations, political, economic, and other conditions in foreign countries 
and regions, including international taxes, government-to-government relations, the typically more volatile economies of emerging 
markets, and geopolitical risks such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may adversely affect our business and results 
of operations. We have suspended all services in Ukraine and Belarus. We also temporarily idled our operations in Russia and reduced 
our presence to the minimum required for purposes of maintaining a legal presence with active transport licenses. While we do not 
expect this conflict to have a direct material effect on our business or results of operations, the broader consequences of this conflict, 
which may include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts; airspace bans relating to certain routes, or 
strategic decisions to alter certain routes; potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against us as a result of our idling of 
operations in Russia, including nationalization of foreign businesses in Russia; increased tensions between the United States and 
countries in which we operate; and the extent of the conflict’s effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global 
economy, cannot be predicted.
To the extent the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, or subsequent similar conflicts between or among other nations, 
adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in this Annual Report, any of 
which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, 
disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack or cyber-intrusion, ransomware attack, or malware 
attack; adverse changes in international trade policies; our ability to maintain or increase our prices, including our fuel surcharges in 
response to rising fuel costs; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy, particularly with regard to our FedEx Express 
international business; disruptions in global supply chains, which can limit the access of FedEx and our service providers to vehicles 
and other key capital resources and increase our costs and could affect our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our 
global operations by calendar 2040; our ability to maintain our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand; terrorist activities 
targeting transportation infrastructure; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the 
capital markets. Geopolitical uncertainty negatively affected operations at FedEx Express in recent years. 
- 26 -Additional changes in international trade policies and relations could significantly reduce the volume of goods transported 
globally and adversely affect our business and results of operations. The U.S. government has taken certain actions that have 
negatively affected U.S. trade, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the U.S. Additionally, several foreign 
governments have imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the U.S. These actions contributed to weakness in the global 
economy that adversely affected our results of operations in recent years. Any further changes in U.S. or international trade policy, 
including tariffs, export controls, quotas, embargoes, or sanctions, could trigger additional retaliatory actions by affected countries, 
resulting in “trade wars” and further increased costs for goods transported globally, which may reduce customer demand for these 
products if the parties having to pay tariffs or other anti-trade measures increase their prices, or in trading partners limiting their trade 
with countries that impose such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade and other disputes could also have a 
negative effect on business and consumer confidence and spending. Such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, 
results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common  stock.
Additionally, the U.S. government has taken action to limit the ability of domestic companies to engage in commerce with certain 
foreign entities under certain circumstances, and foreign governments may investigate our compliance with these restrictions. 
Furthermore, given the nature of our business and our global recognizability, foreign governments may target FedEx by limiting the 
ability of foreign entities to do business with us in certain instances, imposing monetary or other penalties or taking other retaliatory 
action, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on the price of our 
common stock.
Our transportation businesses are affected by the price and availability of jet and vehicle fuel.  We must purchase large quantities of 
fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles, and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile. In 
addition, our purchased transportation expense is affected by fuel costs. To date, we have been mostly successful in mitigating over 
time the expense effect of higher fuel costs through our indexed fuel surcharges, as the amount of the surcharges is closely linked to 
the market prices for fuel. If we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges because of competitive pricing pressures or 
some other reason, fuel costs could adversely affect our operating results. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more information. As of May 31, 2023, we had no 
derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.
Even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges, high fuel surcharges could move our customers away from our 
higher-yielding express services to our lower-yielding deferred or ground services or even reduce customer demand for our services 
altogether. In addition, disruptions in the supply of fuel could have a negative effect on our ability to operate our transportation 
networks. The following factors may affect fuel supply and could result in shortages and price increases in the future: weather-related 
events; natural disasters; political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries; economic sanctions imposed against oil-
producing countries or specific industry participants; changes in governmental policy concerning fuel production, transportation, 
taxes, or marketing; changes in refining capacity; environmental concerns; cyberattacks; and public and investor sentiment. Several of 
these factors combined to constrain fuel supply in 2023, and we expect such conditions to continue to be present in 2024.
Operating Risks
The failure to successfully execute our DRIVE transformation program, including Network 2.0, and our one FedEx consolidation 
plan in the expected time frame and at the expected cost may adversely affect our future results. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, 
FedEx announced our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability, including Network 2.0, the multi-year effort 
to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada. In the fourth quarter 
of 2023, FedEx announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and 
other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation. See “Item 1. Business” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more information. These entities currently 
operate as separate and independent businesses and networks. There can be no assurances that these businesses and networks can 
successfully be consolidated and fully integrated as planned. It is possible that the consolidation and integration process could result in 
higher than currently expected costs, less-than-expected savings, the loss of customers, the disruption of ongoing businesses, union 
organizing, litigation, the loss of key FedEx employees or service providers, or other unexpected issues. It is also possible that the 
overall process will take longer than currently anticipated. Additionally, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in 
order to realize the anticipated timing and projected benefits of our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan:  
•     combining the physical networks and operations of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, including consolidating the 
companies’ linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, and corporate functions; 
•     our ability to maintain coverage of U.S. employees at FedEx Express under the RLA and manage challenges to the 
employment status of drivers employed by service providers engaged by FedEx Ground, in addition to other labor-related risks;
- 27 -•     integrating, consolidating, and implementing new administrative and back-office support functions, information-technology 
infrastructure, and computer systems of the respective companies; 
•     integrating and restructuring the corporate entities;
•     integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to historical FedEx Express and FedEx Ground customers;
•     harmonizing the companies’ operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls, and 
other policies, procedures, and processes;
•     maintaining existing agreements with customers and service providers and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements 
with prospective customers and service providers; 
•     legal challenges by FedEx Ground service providers or government agencies seeking to slow or stop plans related to 
Network 2.0 or our one FedEx consolidation; 
•     addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures, and management philosophies; 
•     addressing employee issues so as to promote retention and maintain efficient and effective labor and employee relations; 
•     maintaining access to ports of call and railroads for intermodal support;
•     managing the movement of certain positions to different locations; 
•     obtaining any required regulatory licenses, operating authority, or contractual consents; and
•     managing unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the consolidation and integration process.
 
We may not be able to achieve the expected operational efficiencies and network flexibility, alignment of our cost base with demand, 
cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure, and other benefits from our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx 
consolidation plan. The actual amount and timing of costs to be incurred and related cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost 
structure resulting from these initiatives and enhancements may differ from our current expectations and estimates. These initiatives 
and enhancements could also result in asset impairment charges and changes to our tax liabilities and deferred tax balances. If we are 
not able to successfully implement our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan, our future financial results will 
suffer and we may not be able to achieve our financial performance goals. 
All of these factors could adversely affect FedEx’s results of operations and negatively affect the price of our common stock. In 
addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management may be focused on the DRIVE transformation and one FedEx 
consolidation plan and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our business. 
A significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operations and result in the loss of 
critical confidential information, adversely affecting our reputation, business, or results of operations. Our ability to attract and 
retain customers, efficiently operate our businesses, execute our DRIVE transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan, and 
compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication, security, and reliability of our technology network, including our ability 
to provide features of service that are important to our customers, to protect our confidential business information and the information 
provided by our customers, and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our systems and to provide services 
consistent with their expectations. For example, we rely on information technology to receive package-level information in advance of 
physical receipt of packages, to track items that move through our delivery systems, to efficiently plan deliveries, to clear shipments 
through customs, to execute billing processes, and to track and report financial and operational data. We are subject to risks imposed 
by data breaches and operational disruptions, including through cyberattack or cyber-intrusion, ransomware attack, or malware attack 
by computer hackers, foreign governments and state-sponsored actors, cyber terrorists and activists, cyber criminals, malicious 
employees or other insiders of FedEx or third-party service providers, and other groups and individuals. Data breaches and other 
technology disruptions of companies and governments continue to increase as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted 
attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and we, our customers, and third parties increasingly store and transmit 
data by means of connected information technology systems. Additionally, risks such as code anomalies, “Acts of God,” transitional 
challenges in migrating operating company functionality to our FedEx enterprise automation platforms, data leakage, cyber-fraud, and 
human error pose a direct threat to our products, services, systems, and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate 
access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations, customers, employees, and suppliers, including personal information. 
- 28 -The technology infrastructure of acquired businesses, as well as their practices related to the use and maintenance of data, could also 
present issues that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition. For example, ShopRunner, which we acquired in 2021, collects 
and stores certain personal data of its merchants and their buyers, its partners, consumers with whom it has a direct relationship, and 
users of its applications. Additionally, it uses third-party service providers and subprocessors to help deliver services to merchants and 
their buyers. These service providers and subprocessors may store or access personal data, including payment information and/or other 
confidential information. The foregoing factors increase the risk of data incidents and the amount of potential exposure in the event of 
a data breach. 
We also depend on and interact with the technology and systems of third parties, including our customers and third-party service 
providers such as cloud service providers and delivery services. Such third parties may host, process, or have access to information we 
maintain about our company, customers, employees, and vendors or operate systems that are critical to our business operations and 
services. Like us, these third parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches, cyberattacks, and other events or actions that could 
damage, disrupt, or close down their networks or systems. We have security processes, protocols, and standards in place, including 
contractual provisions requiring such security measures, that are applicable to such third parties and are designed to protect 
information that is held by them, or to which they have access, as a result of their engagements with us. Nevertheless, a cyberattack 
could defeat one or more of such third parties’ security measures, allowing an attacker to obtain information about our company, 
customers, employees, and vendors or disrupt our operations. These third parties may also experience operational disruptions or 
human error that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations, customers, employees, 
and suppliers, including personal information.
A disruption to our complex, global technology infrastructure, including those affecting our computer systems and websites, could 
result in the loss of confidential business or customer information, require substantial repairs or replacements, resulting in significant 
costs, and lead to the temporary or permanent transfer by customers of some or all of their business to our competitors. The foregoing 
could harm our reputation and adversely affect our operations, customer service, and results of operations. Additionally, a security 
breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created. These types of adverse effects 
could also occur in the event the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of company and customer information was compromised due 
to a data loss by FedEx or a trusted third party. We or the third parties with which we share information may not discover any security 
breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs. 
We have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information-technology risk management, business 
continuity, and disaster recovery plans, including investments to retire and replace end-of-life systems. The development and 
maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to 
overcome security measures become increasingly more frequent, intense, and sophisticated. Despite our efforts, we are not fully 
insulated from data breaches, technology disruptions, data loss, and cyber-fraud, which could adversely affect our competitiveness and 
results of operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2021 for 
information regarding the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack at TNT Express and immaterial cyber incidents we experienced in 2017 and 
2018. Additionally, we have experienced continual attempts by cyber criminals, some of which have been successful, to gain access to 
customer accounts for the purposes of fraudulently diverting and misappropriating items being transported in our network. None of 
these fraudulent cyber activities caused a material disruption to our systems or resulted in any material costs to FedEx. 
While we have significant security processes and initiatives in place, we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption in 
the future. Additionally, while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place, we cannot be 
certain that we will continue to be able to obtain excess insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, our insurance carriers will 
pay on our insurance claims, or we will not experience a claim for which coverage is not provided. See “Our business is subject to 
complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection.” below for additional information on risks 
related to legal and regulatory developments with respect to data protection. A significant number of our employees as well as 
customers and others with whom we do business continue to work remotely or in hybrid models, which may heighten these risks. 
These risks may also be heightened by our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan.
- 29 -We are self-insured for certain costs associated with our operations, and insurance and claims expenses could have a material 
adverse effect on us. We are self-insured up to certain limits that vary by operating company and type of risk for costs associated with 
workers’ compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under 
employee disability programs. Our self-insurance accruals are primarily based on estimated costs determined by actuarial methods. 
Estimated costs include consideration of a variety of factors and related assumptions such as the severity of claims, frequency and 
volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs, which may be subject to a high degree of variability. However, 
the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time 
until the ultimate cost is known, which may be several years. Material increases in the magnitude of claims, changes to healthcare 
costs, accident frequency and severity, insurance retention levels, judgment and settlement amounts, associated legal expenses, and 
other factors could result in unfavorable differences between actual self-insurance costs and our reserve estimates. As a result, our 
insurance and claims costs could continue to increase materially which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial 
condition. During 2023, higher self-insurance accruals negatively affected our results of operations. See “Item 7. Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more information.
As a supplement to our self-insurance program, we maintain coverage with excess insurance carriers for potential losses that exceed 
the amounts we self-insure. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk 
tolerance, risk volatility, and premium expense. Although we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover our 
historic claims amounts, the commercial trucking industry has experienced a wave of blockbuster or so-called “nuclear” verdicts, 
including some instances in which juries have awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to those injured in accidents and their families. 
See Note 9 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in “Item 1. Financial Statements” of our Quarterly 
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended August 31, 2022 for information regarding the 2015 jury award of approximately 
$160 million in compensatory damages in a lawsuit related to a vehicle accident involving a driver employed by a service provider 
engaged by FedEx Ground, subsequent court affirmation of the award in 2018 and 2022, and our pursuit of reimbursement from 
insurers of our payment of approximately $210 million of pre- and post-judgment interest. Given this recent trend, it is possible that 
additional claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. If another claim were to exceed our aggregate insurance coverage, we 
would bear the excess in addition to our other self-insured amounts.
Given the current claims environment, the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carriers is decreasing, the premiums 
for this excess coverage are increasing significantly, and excess insurance carriers are challenging insurance claims more frequently. 
Accordingly, our excess insurance and claims expenses may continue to increase, or we could further increase our self-insured 
retention as policies are renewed or replaced. Our results of operations and financial condition could continue to be adversely affected 
if our costs or losses significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we are unable to obtain excess insurance coverage in amounts 
we deem sufficient, our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims, or we experience a claim for which coverage is not 
provided.
The effects of a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis on our business, 
results of operations, and financial condition are highly unpredictable. A widespread outbreak of an illness or any other 
communicable disease or public health crisis, including new variants of COVID-19, could have varying effects on the demand for our 
services, our business operations, and the global economy and supply chains. The extent of the effect of such an event on our business, 
results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the global economy, will be dictated by developments that cannot be 
predicted, such as its duration and spread; the success of efforts to contain it and treat its effects, such as travel bans and restrictions, 
quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions; the possibility of additional 
subsequent widespread outbreaks and variant strains and the effect of actions taken in response; and the resulting effects on the 
economic conditions in the global markets in which we operate. We have now shifted to operating in a more stable post-COVID-19 
environment with less restrictions, which resulted in consumers returning to near pre-pandemic shopping patterns during 2023.
Our business is labor and capital intensive in nature, which may require us to incur higher costs to operate our networks during such 
an event. If we are unable to remain agile and flex our networks to align with shipping volumes, customer needs, disrupted global 
supply chains and other network inefficiencies, market demands, and operating conditions, or are unable to continuously respond to 
evolving governmental policies, our business operations could be negatively affected, which could have a further adverse effect on our 
results of operations. Further, due to the size, scope, and geographically dispersed nature of our operations, the expenses we incur to 
protect the health and safety of our team members and customers may be higher than similar expenses incurred by companies in other 
industries.
- 30 -To the extent a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis adversely affects our 
business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks described in this section, any of which could 
materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such risks include, but are not limited to, 
additional changes in the state of the global economy and international trade policies and relations; our ability to execute our DRIVE 
transformation and one FedEx consolidation plan, implement our business strategy, and effectively respond to changes in market 
dynamics and customer preferences; our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand; our ability to meet our labor and 
purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs; changes in the business and financial soundness of the USPS; our 
ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040; and the effect of litigation or claims from 
customers, team members, suppliers, regulators, or other third parties relating to the crisis or our actions in response.
See “Description of Business Segments  — Trends Affecting Our Business” under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended 
May 31, 2020, May 31, 2021, and May 31, 2022, for information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business, 
results of operations, and financial condition.
The transportation infrastructure continues to be a target of terrorist activities.  Because transportation assets continue to be a target 
of terrorist activities, governments around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will 
increase operating costs and potentially slow service for businesses, including those in the transportation industry. These security 
requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional 
security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. For example, the TSA requires FedEx Express to comply with a 
Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. Additionally, the 
ICAO’s standard that previously allowed a member state to permit carriers and other entities to determine, without government 
oversight, which shippers and shipments are secure for purposes of putting those shipments on all-cargo aircraft was modified 
effective July 1, 2021. As a result, we are now required to undertake additional security measures for international outbound 
shipments. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us or slow our 
service to our customers. The effects on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are 
geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of aircraft by parties to those conflicts can also be significant. Moreover, a terrorist attack 
directed at FedEx or other aspects of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operations and adversely affect demand for our 
services. 
Strategic Risks
Failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer 
preferences will cause our future financial results to suffer. We are making significant investments and other decisions in 
connection with our long-term business strategy, such as those related to our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0, and one 
FedEx consolidation plan. See “The failure to successfully execute our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx 
consolidation plan in the expected time frame and at the expected cost may adversely affect our future results.” above and  “Item 1. 
Business” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual 
Report for additional information. Such initiatives and enhancements may require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur 
significant expenses. We have also incurred, and may continue to incur, increased operating expenses in connection with certain 
changes to our business strategy. We may not be able to derive the expected operational efficiencies and network flexibility, alignment 
of our cost base with demand, cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure, and other benefits from our strategic 
investments and other decisions. 
Further, in developing our business strategy, we make certain assumptions including, but not limited to, those related to customer 
demand and the mix of services to be purchased by our customers, the future rate of e-commerce growth and inventory restocking, 
passenger airline cargo capacity, competition, and the global economy, and actual market, economic, and other conditions may be 
different from our assumptions. As technology, customer behavior, and market conditions continue to evolve, it is important that we 
maintain the relevance of our brand and service offerings to our customers. If we are not able to successfully implement our business 
strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences, our future financial results will suffer. For 
additional discussion, see “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report under the caption “Strategy.”
- 31 -Our businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels.  We make significant 
investments in aircraft, package handling facilities, vehicles, technology, sort equipment, acquired companies, and other assets to 
support our transportation and business networks. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including 
our anticipated volume growth. We must make commitments to purchase or modify aircraft years before the aircraft are actually 
needed. We must predict volume levels and fleet requirements and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. Missing 
our projections could result in too much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volumes. Overcapacity could lead to below-
market asset dispositions or write-downs, as well as negatively affect operating margins, and undercapacity could negatively affect 
service levels. Difficulties in quickly adjusting our operations and fixed-cost structure to match shifting volume levels, particularly at 
FedEx Express, negatively affected our results of operations in 2023. Additionally, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition — Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — 
Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges” of this Annual Report for information regarding a noncash impairment charge 
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with our decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines from 
service.
We depend on our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand.  The FedEx brand name symbolizes high-quality service, 
reliability, and speed. FedEx is one of the most widely recognized, trusted, and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is 
one of our most important and valuable assets. In addition, we have a strong reputation among customers, team members, and the 
general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethics. The FedEx brand 
name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales, marketing, and recruitment tools, and we devote significant resources to 
promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our team members or others with 
whom we do business, such as customer service mishaps, accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft, vehicles, or facilities 
operated by us or our service providers; low safety or service levels; data breaches or technology infrastructure disruptions; 
noncompliance with laws and allegations or claims that result in litigation; the shipment of certain items pursuant to our obligation as 
a common carrier operating under federal law; labor relations and workforce reductions; our advertising campaigns, sponsorship 
arrangements, or marketing programs; our political activities and expenditures; our executive compensation practices; or use of 
artificial intelligence could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media 
outlets such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly 
without context, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Certain forms of technology also allow users to alter 
images, videos, and other information relating to FedEx and present the information in a false or misleading manner. Further, our 
actual or perceived position or lack of position on environmental, social, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any 
perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups, including our customers, team 
members, governments, and regulatory bodies. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our 
services and/or create difficulties in retaining and recruiting employee talent, and thus have an adverse effect on our financial 
condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of 
our brand. 
Changes in the business or financial soundness of the USPS, including strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on 
the air network of FedEx Express, are likely to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  The 
USPS is the largest customer of FedEx Express, which provides domestic air transportation services for the USPS’s First Class Mail, 
Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail and transportation and delivery for the USPS’s international delivery service. See “Item 1. 
Business” of this Annual Report under “FedEx Express Segment” for more information.
Pursuant to previously announced plans to restructure its operations, the USPS continues to implement strategic changes to its 
operations to reduce its reliance on the air network of FedEx Express, which negatively affected our results of operations in 2023. 
FedEx Express expects lower volumes from the USPS in 2024. Additional changes in the USPS’s business, including further 
structural changes to its operations, network, volume levels, service offerings, service commitments, or pricing, could have additional 
negative effects on our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, the USPS’s contract with FedEx Express for 
domestic services expires on September 29, 2024, and there is no assurance that the contract will be renewed on terms that are 
commercially acceptable to FedEx. Additionally, a decision by the USPS to terminate the contract early could negatively affect our 
profitability.
- 32 -We face intense competition.  The transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and 
service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. Some of our competitors have more financial resources and 
competitive advantages than we do, appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share, or they are owned, controlled, 
or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital more easily. We also compete with regional transportation 
providers that operate smaller and less capital-intensive transportation networks and startup companies that combine technology with 
flexible labor solutions such as crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers are 
developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, which could in turn 
reduce our revenues and market share. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has 
expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. See “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report 
for additional information.
We believe we compete effectively with these companies – for example, by providing more reliable service at compensatory prices. 
However, the existence of an irrational pricing environment could limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our prices 
(including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs), but also to maintain or grow our revenues and market share. While we 
believe we compete effectively through our current and planned service offerings, if our current competitors or potential future 
competitors offer a broader range of services or better service levels, more effectively bundle their services, or offer services at lower 
prices, it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share. Continued transportation industry consolidation may further 
increase competition. Moreover, if high-volume package shippers further develop or expand internal capabilities for the services we 
provide, it may reduce our revenue and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. These effects could be 
exacerbated if high-volume package shippers offer such capabilities to third parties. News regarding such developments or expansions 
could also negatively affect the price of our common stock. 
Additionally, advancements in technology, such as advanced safety systems; automated package sorting, handling, and delivery; 
autonomous delivery; third-party supply chain insight and management; artificial intelligence; vehicle platooning; alternative fuel 
vehicles; and digitization of freight services, may necessitate that we increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our 
customers may not be willing to accept higher rates to cover the cost of these investments.
Our inability to execute and effectively operate, integrate, leverage, and grow acquired businesses and realize the anticipated 
benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances and investments could materially adversely affect us.  Our strategy for 
long-term growth, productivity, and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and investments, 
form joint ventures or strategic alliances, and realize the expected benefits from these transactions. We regularly acquire businesses, 
enter into strategic alliances, and make investments across the more than 220 countries and territories in which we provide services.
 
Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve special commercial, customer, accounting, regulatory, compliance, information 
technology, human resources, cultural, and other risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and 
contingencies. Additionally, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures and/or incur certain operating expenses 
following the completion of certain transactions, which may be higher than initially expected. For example, existing and future 
customer data in the systems and business of FedEx and ShopRunner may not be ultimately interoperable, or may not be interoperable 
without significant added expense. 
While we expect our past and future acquisitions and strategic transactions to enhance our value proposition to customers and improve 
our business and long-term profitability, there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have 
established, if at all, or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to acquired businesses, including their goodwill or other 
intangible assets. We have previously incurred goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions, some of which have 
been material, and may incur additional goodwill impairment charges in the future. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition — Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — 
Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges” of this Annual Report for information regarding a noncash impairment charge 
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the ShopRunner acquisition.
- 33 -Human Resource Management Risks
Our failure to attract and retain employee talent, meet our purchased transportation needs, or maintain our company culture, as 
well as increases in labor and purchased transportation costs, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our 
success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our high-quality employees, many of whom are longstanding FedEx team members. 
Difficulties in motivating, rewarding, recruiting, and retaining employee talent, including successors to members of senior 
management; the unexpected loss of such individuals resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base; and/or our 
inability to successfully transition key roles could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation, and the 
price of our common stock. We also regularly seek to hire a large number of part-time and seasonal workers, and FedEx Ground 
utilizes contracted service providers to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations.
Certain positions at FedEx have historically experienced high turnover rates, which can lead to increased recruiting, training, and 
retention costs. Additionally, our company culture is important to providing high-quality customer service and having a productive 
workforce and could be adversely affected by our growing operations and other factors. If we fail to maintain the strength of our 
company culture, our competitive ability and our business may be harmed. 
Our business is labor intensive in nature, and our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related 
costs is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of qualified service providers and persons in the 
markets where we and our contracted service providers operate and unemployment levels within these markets, prevailing and 
competitive wage rates and other benefits, health and other insurance costs, inflation, fuel and energy prices and availability, 
behavioral changes, adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations (including increased minimum wage 
requirements) or government programs, safety levels of our operations, our reputation within the labor and transportation markets, 
changes in the business or financial soundness of service providers, interest in contracting with FedEx, the effect of a widespread 
public health crisis, the availability of child care, and vaccine mandates that may be announced in jurisdictions in which our 
businesses and service providers operate. Additionally, certain service providers (acting collectively or in coordination in some 
instances) may seek to increase financial rates or modify contract terms and may refuse to provide service to FedEx in connection with 
such initiatives.
Our inability to effectively meet our labor and purchased transportation needs can increase our costs, hinder our ability to execute our 
business strategy, negatively affect service levels, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Certain of these risks 
may be heightened by our DRIVE transformation, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan.
Labor organizations attempt to organize groups of our employees from time to time, and potential changes in labor laws could 
make it easier for them to do so.  If we are unable to maintain positive relationships with our employees and to avoid having labor 
organizations organize groups of our employees, our operating costs could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could 
be significantly reduced. Despite continual organizing attempts by labor unions, other than the pilots at FedEx Express and drivers at 
one FedEx Freight facility, our U.S. employees have thus far chosen not to unionize (we acquired FedEx Supply Chain in 2015, which 
already had a small number of employees who are members of unions). Additionally, certain of FedEx Express’s non-U.S. employees 
are unionized. For information regarding the tentative successor agreement FedEx Express reached with the union representing the 
pilots of FedEx Express in May 2023, see “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report under the caption “FedEx Express Segment — 
FedEx Express — Employees.”  
Labor unions have recently attempted to organize employees at businesses and in industries that have not traditionally been unionized, 
and in certain instances have been successful. Such attempts could continue in 2024. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, 
considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there 
is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA. Additionally, 
this jurisdiction could be challenged in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan. For additional discussion of the RLA, see 
“Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report under the caption “Regulation.” Such legislation or challenge could expose our customers to 
the type of service disruptions that the RLA was designed to prevent — local work stoppages in key areas that interrupt the timely 
flow of shipments of time-sensitive, high-value goods throughout our global network. Such disruptions could threaten our ability to 
provide competitively priced shipping options and ready access to global markets. 
- 34 -There is also the possibility that Congress could pass other labor legislation that could adversely affect our companies, such as FedEx 
Ground and FedEx Freight, whose employees are governed by the NLRA. In addition, federal and state governmental agencies, such 
as the NMB and the NLRB, have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees, as well as our vendor 
and supplier workforces, to organize under the RLA or NLRA. Finally, changes to federal or state laws, regulations, rules, judicial or 
administrative precedent, or guidance governing employee classification could affect the status of FedEx Ground’s service providers 
as independent employers of drivers. If FedEx Ground is deemed to be an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these service 
providers, labor organizations could more easily organize these individuals, our operating costs could increase materially, and we 
could incur significant capital outlays and experience adverse effects to service levels. 
FedEx Ground contracts with service providers to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, and the status of these 
service providers as direct and exclusive employers of drivers providing these services is being challenged.  We are defending joint-
employer cases where it is alleged that FedEx Ground should be treated as an employer or joint employer of the drivers employed by 
service providers engaged by FedEx Ground. We incur certain costs, including legal fees, in defending the status of service providers 
engaged by FedEx Ground as direct employers of their drivers. We continue to believe that FedEx Ground is not an employer or joint 
employer of the drivers of these independent businesses. However, adverse determinations in these matters or regulatory 
developments could, among other things, entitle service providers’ drivers to certain wage payments and penalties from the service 
providers and FedEx Ground, and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for FedEx Ground. The status of the 
drivers employed by these service providers could be further challenged in connection with our one FedEx consolidation plan. 
Proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations could impair our operations and impose substantial costs on us . In 2010, the FAA 
proposed regulations that would change the flight and duty time rules applicable to all-cargo air carriers. When the FAA issued final 
regulations in 2011 (the “2011 regulations”), all-cargo carriers, including FedEx Express, were exempt from these new requirements. 
Instead, all-cargo carriers were required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules and allowed to 
pursue the development of fatigue risk management systems to develop fatigue mitigations unique to each operation. In 2012, the 
FAA reaffirmed the exclusion of all-cargo carriers from the 2011 regulations, and litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia affirmed the FAA’s decision. However, this issue remains a policy priority for certain labor groups, and the U.S. 
Congress periodically considers legislation that, if adopted, would require all-cargo carriers to comply with the 2011 regulations. 
Required compliance with the 2011 regulations would make it more difficult to avoid pilot fatigue and could impose substantial costs 
on us in order to maintain operational reliability.
Increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements, and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially 
pension and healthcare benefits, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We sponsor 
programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans, defined 
contribution plans, and postretirement healthcare plans. The costs of providing pension and other retirement benefit plans are 
dependent on numerous assumptions, such as discount rates, expected long-term investment returns on plan assets, future salary 
increases, employee turnover, mortality, and retirement ages. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the 
assumptions and actual values, as well as significant declines in the value of investments that fund our pension and other 
postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, 
and we could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations 
could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, the rules for pension and retirement benefit plan 
accounting are complex, involve numerous assumptions, and can produce volatility in our results of operations, financial condition, 
and liquidity. For example, our fourth quarter mark-to-market (“MTM”) retirement plans accounting adjustment resulted in a pre-tax, 
noncash gain of $650 million in 2023 ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share) and a loss of $1.6 billion in 2022 ($1.2 
billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share). For additional information on our MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments, see 
“Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Results of Operations and 
Outlook—Consolidated Results—Retirement Plans MTM Adjustments” and Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements included 
in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.
- 35 -Environmental, Climate, and Weather Risks
We may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change. Concern over climate 
change, including the effect of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit 
GHG emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions. Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering 
GHG regulatory requirements. Compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that 
various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change. Increased regulation regarding 
GHG emissions, especially aircraft or vehicle engine emissions, could impose substantial costs on us, especially at FedEx Express. 
These costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital and impairment costs associated with 
updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. Until the timing, scope, and extent of such possible regulation becomes 
known, we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible, however, that it could 
materially increase our operating expenses and have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business, if instituted. For additional 
discussion of regulatory responses to climate change, including CORSIA and the Paris climate accord, see “Item 1. Business” of this 
Annual Report under the caption “Regulation.” We may also incur additional expenses as a result of U.S. and international regulators 
requiring additional disclosures regarding GHG emissions.
Moreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs 
emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our 
services, especially our air express services. Finally, given the broad and global scope of our operations and our susceptibility to 
global macroeconomic trends, we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change that could affect all of humankind, 
such as shifts in weather patterns and world ecosystems. 
We may be unable to achieve or demonstrate progress on our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040.
In 2021, we announced a goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040. Achievement of this goal 
depends on our execution of operational strategies relating to vehicle electrification; sustainable fuels; aircraft fuel conservation and 
fleet modernization; facilities; and sustainable customer solutions. 
Execution of these strategies, as well as demonstrable progress on and achievement of our calendar 2040 goal, is subject to risks and 
uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to 
successfully implement our business strategy, effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and achieve the anticipated benefits 
and associated cost savings of such strategies and actions; the availability and cost of, and our ability to acquire, alternative fuel 
vehicles, alternative fuels, fuel-efficient aircraft, global electrical charging infrastructure, off-site renewable energy, and other 
materials and components, many of which are not presently in existence or available at scale; unforeseen production, design, 
operational, and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability 
to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related processes; 
compliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates, or requirements relating to 
GHG emissions, carbon costs, or climate-related goals; labor-related regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to 
impose requirements on third parties who provide contracted transportation for our transportation networks; the availability of 
incentives to enhance the production and affordability of alternative fuel vehicles, alternative fuels, global electrical charging 
infrastructure, and other materials and components; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable 
supply chain solutions and potentially increased prices for our services; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures.
There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve or demonstrate progress on our calendar 
2040 goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations. Additionally, we may determine that it is in our best interests to prioritize 
other business, social, governance, or sustainable investments and/or initiatives (including our DRIVE transformation program, 
including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan) over the achievement of our calendar 2040 goal based on economic, 
regulatory, or social factors, business strategy, or other reasons. Failure to achieve or demonstrate progress on our calendar 2040 goal 
could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships. Further, given investors’ and banks’ increased focus 
related to ESG matters, such a failure could cause large stockholders to reduce their ownership of FedEx common stock and limit our 
access to financing. Such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as 
well as on the price of our common stock.
- 36 -Our inability to quickly and effectively restore operations following adverse weather or a localized disaster or disturbance in a key 
geography could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  While we operate several integrated networks with assets 
distributed throughout the world, there are concentrations of key assets within our networks that are exposed to adverse weather 
conditions or localized risks from natural or manmade disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, 
floods, severe winter weather, conflicts or unrest, terrorist attacks, or other disturbances, actual or threatened. Additionally, shifts in 
weather patterns caused by climate change could increase the frequency, severity, or duration of certain adverse weather conditions. 
Prolonged interruptions or disruptions at a key location such as our FedEx Express Memphis World Hub or one of our information-
technology centers could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also may incur significant costs to reestablish or 
relocate these functions. Moreover, resulting economic dislocations, including supply chain and fuel disruptions, could adversely 
affect demand for our services resulting in an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Other Legal, Regulatory, and Miscellaneous Risks
Government regulation and enforcement are evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business. We are subject to 
regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. government regulations, laws, policies, and actions. 
There can be no assurance that such regulations, laws, policies, and actions will not be changed in ways that will decrease the demand 
for our services, subject us to escalating costs, or require us to modify our business models and objectives (such as our DRIVE 
transformation program, including Network 2.0, and one FedEx consolidation plan), harming our financial results. In particular, 
legislative, regulatory, or other actions that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have undertaken or could take in areas such as data 
privacy and sovereignty, the use of new technology, taxes, foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility, currency 
controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions, trade controls, tariffs, quotas, embargoes, or 
sanctions in the U.S. or other countries, complex economic sanctions, import and export controls, customs standards, additional 
security or workplace and transportation health and safety requirements, labor and employment standards (including with respect to 
our pilots), worker classification, joint employment and benefits, government contracting, regulated commodities, environmental or 
emission standards, and accounting may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, 
effective tax rate, and service levels. For additional discussion, see “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report under the caption 
“Regulation.” Additionally, the current U.S. presidential administration and various U.S. federal and state regulatory bodies have 
indicated a desire to reform various aspects of existing laws, regulations, and enforcement priorities and strategies that could, among 
other things, lead to comprehensive tax reform, broadly increase the U.S. minimum wage, make it easier for unions to organize our 
U.S. employees or the employees of our service providers, and alter the employment relationship between service providers engaged 
by FedEx Ground and the drivers employed by those service providers.   
We could be subject to adverse changes in regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.  We are subject to 
taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be enacted that 
could significantly affect our overall tax liabilities and our effective tax rate. U.S. and foreign governmental agencies maintain focus 
on the taxation of multinational companies, including statutory tax rates, global minimum taxes (such as the framework agreed to by 
members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2022), digital taxes, and transactions between affiliated 
companies. Such changes may require new and complex computations to be performed, significant judgments, estimates, and 
calculations to be made, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced.
Standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of certain tax laws and regulations will be applied or 
otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation, and we may be required to make adjustments to amounts that we have 
recorded that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Results of Operations and Outlook—Consolidated Results—Income 
Taxes” of this Annual Report for additional information regarding ongoing tax examinations and challenges. Additionally, see “Item 
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Critical Accounting Estimates—Income 
Taxes” of this Annual Report for information regarding estimates and potential adjustments related to our tax positions.
- 37 -Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection. There has 
recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and processing of 
personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally, including the EU’s General Data Protection 
Regulation, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, and other similar laws that have been or 
will be enacted by other jurisdictions. In addition, China and certain other jurisdictions have enacted more stringent data localization 
requirements. An actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection laws, regulations, or other data 
protection standards may expose us to litigation (including, in some instances, class action litigation), fines, sanctions, or other 
penalties, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. This 
regulatory environment is increasingly challenging, based on discretionary factors, and difficult to predict. Consequently, compliance 
with all applicable regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we do business may present material obligations and risks to our 
business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs, and enforcement risks; require us to make extensive system or 
operational changes; or adversely affect the cost or attractiveness of the services we offer. All of these evolving compliance and 
operational requirements, as well as the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of laws, impose significant costs and regulatory risks 
that are likely to increase over time. Developing privacy legislation within the U.S. may also create limitations or added requirements 
on the use of personal data by FedEx Dataworks and the other FedEx operating companies.
The regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation rights may affect our operations and increase our 
operating costs.  Our extensive air network is critical to our success. Our right to serve foreign points is subject to the approval of the 
DOT and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and foreign governments. In addition, we must obtain the 
permission of foreign governments to provide specific flights and services. Our operations outside of the U.S., such as FedEx 
Express’s international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations 
and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult, and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as 
FedEx Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market. Regulatory or 
executive actions affecting global aviation or transportation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation 
rights in important international markets could impair our ability to operate our networks. Further, our ability to obtain or maintain 
aviation or other transportation rights internationally may be adversely affected by changes in international trade policies and 
relations.
We are subject to other extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that may result in significant costs. For instance, the 
FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require 
significant expenditures in order to comply. High-profile accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft may trigger increased 
regulatory and legal compliance requirements. These requirements can be issued with little or no notice, or can otherwise affect our 
ability to efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft, and in some instances have resulted in the temporary grounding of aircraft types 
altogether. Further, our business may be adversely affected when government agencies and air traffic control and other systems they 
oversee cease to operate as expected, including due to partial shutdowns, sequestrations, or similar events. Lapses in government 
operations may result in, among other things, disruptions in the ability of government agencies to grant required regulatory approvals. 
For additional discussion, see “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report under the caption “Regulation.”  
We are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including: 
•   our ability to mitigate the technological, operational, legal and regulatory, and reputational risks related to autonomous 
technology and artificial intelligence;
•     the increasing costs of compliance with federal, state, and foreign governmental agency mandates (including the Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act) and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement or other actions 
by such agencies;
•     changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially in the euro, Chinese yuan, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong 
Kong dollar, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, and Mexican peso, which can affect our sales levels and foreign currency sales 
prices;
•     loss or delay in the collection of accounts receivable;
•     any liability resulting from and the costs of defending against class-action, derivative, and other litigation, such as wage-
and-hour, joint employment, securities, vehicle accident, and discrimination and retaliation claims, claims related to our 
reporting and disclosure of climate change and other ESG topics, and any other legal or governmental proceedings, including 
the matters discussed in Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report; 
- 38 -•     adverse rulings on appeals and in other future judicial decisions, subsequent adverse jury findings, and changes in judicial 
precedent;
•     the sufficiency of insurance coverage we purchase;
•     the effect of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our services, and our ability to continue to 
identify and eliminate unnecessary information-technology redundancy and complexity throughout the organization;
•     disruptions in global supply chains, which can limit the access of FedEx and our service providers to vehicles and other key 
capital resources and increase our costs;
•     difficulties experienced by the companies with which we contract to fly smaller regional “feeder” aircraft in attracting and 
retaining pilots, which could cause a reduction of service offered to certain locations, service disruptions, increased costs of 
operations, and other difficulties;
•     the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU (“Brexit”), including the economic, operational, regulatory, and financial effects of 
any post-Brexit trade deal between the United Kingdom and EU;
•     governmental underinvestment in transportation infrastructure, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our 
service levels due to traffic congestion, prolonged closure of key thoroughfares, or sub-optimal routing of our vehicles and 
aircraft;
•     stockholder activism, which could divert the attention of management and our board of directors from our business, hinder 
execution of our business strategy, give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, and cause the price of our common stock 
to fluctuate significantly; 
•     successful completion of our planned stock repurchases; and
•     constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets, our ability to maintain our current credit ratings, commercial 
paper ratings, and senior unsecured debt and pass-through certificate credit ratings, and our ability to meet credit agreement 
financial covenants.

FedEx Express’s primary sorting facility, which serves as the center of its multiple hub-and-spoke system, is located at the Memphis 
International Airport. FedEx Express’s facilities at the Memphis International Airport also include aircraft hangars, aircraft ramp 
areas, vehicle parking areas, flight training and fuel facilities, the FedEx Cold Chain Center, administrative offices, and warehouse 
space. 
- 41 -FedEx Express leases these facilities from the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority (the “Authority”). The lease obligates 
FedEx Express to maintain and insure the leased property and to pay all related taxes, assessments, and other charges. The lease is 
subordinate to, and FedEx Express’s rights thereunder could be affected by, any future lease or agreement between the Authority and 
the U.S. government. 
FedEx Express has additional major international sorting-and-handling facilities located at Narita Airport in Tokyo and Stansted 
Airport outside London. FedEx Express also has a substantial presence at airports in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Dubai. A central air

PART II 
ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER 
PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
FedEx’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “FDX.” As of July 13, 2023, there were 12,405 
holders of record of our common stock. 
We expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends, though each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and 
approval by our Board of Directors. We evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis. There are no material restrictions 
on our ability to declare dividends, nor are there any material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the 
form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.
On December 16, 2021, we announced a stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors, through which we are 
authorized to purchase, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, up to $5 billion of FedEx common stock. As of July 
13, 2023, approximately $2.1 billion remains available to be used for repurchases under the December 2021 stock repurchase 
program, which is the only such program that currently exists. The program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or 
discontinued at any time. 
We did not repurchase any shares of FedEx common stock during the fourth quarter of 2023.
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and Note 1 of the 
consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report for

ITEM 6. [RESERVED]  
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL 
CONDITION 
ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION 
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (“MD&A”) of FedEx Corporation 
(“FedEx” or the “Company”) is composed of three major sections: Results of Operations and Outlook, Financial Condition, and 
Critical Accounting Estimates. These sections include the following information: 
• Results of operations includes an overview of our consolidated 2023 results compared to 2022 results. This section also 
includes a discussion of key actions and events that impacted our results, as well as our outlook for 2024. Discussion and 
analysis of 2021 results and year-over-year comparisons between 2022 results and 2021 results can be found in “Item 7. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of our Annual Report on Form 10-
K (“Annual Report”) for the year ended May 31, 2022. 
- 46 -• The overview is followed by a discussion of both historical operating results and our outlook for 2024, as well as a financial 
summary and analysis for each of our transportation segments. 
• Our financial condition is reviewed through an analysis of key elements of our liquidity and capital resources, financial 
commitments, and liquidity outlook for 2024. 
• Critical accounting estimates discusses those financial statement elements that we believe are most important to understanding 
the material judgments and assumptions incorporated in our financial results. 
The discussion in MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report, particularly “Item 1. Business,” 
“Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We provide a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services through companies competing collectively, 
operating collaboratively, and innovating digitally as one FedEx. Our primary operating companies are Federal Express Corporation 
(“FedEx Express”), the world’s largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (“FedEx Ground”), a 
leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery services; and FedEx Freight Corporation (“FedEx Freight”), a 
leading North American provider of less-than-truckload (“LTL”) freight transportation services. These companies represent our major 
service lines and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. (“FedEx Services”), constitute our reportable segments. Our FedEx 
Services segment provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and 
collection services, and certain back-office functions that support our operating segments. The operating costs of the FedEx Services 
segment are allocated to the business units it serves. See “Reportable Segments” for further discussion and refer to “Item 1. Business” 
for a more detailed description of each of our operating companies and information regarding our “one FedEx” consolidation plan to 
ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express 
Corporation. 
The key indicators necessary to understand our operating results include: 
• the overall customer demand for our various services based on macroeconomic factors and the global economy; 
• the volumes of transportation services provided through our networks, primarily measured by our average daily volume and 
shipment weight and size; 
• the mix of services purchased by our customers; 
• the prices we obtain for our services, primarily measured by yield (revenue per package or pound or revenue per shipment or 
hundredweight for LTL freight shipments); 
• our ability to manage our cost structure (capital expenditures and operating expenses) to match shifting volume levels; and 
• the timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our fuel 
surcharges. 
Trends Affecting Our Business
The following trends significantly impact the indicators discussed above, as well as our business and operating results. See the risk 
factors identified under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information. Additionally, see “Results of Operations and Outlook – 
Consolidated Results – Outlook” and “Results of Operations and Outlook – Financial Condition – Liquidity Outlook” below for 
additional information on efforts we are taking to mitigate adverse trends.
Macroeconomic Conditions
While macroeconomic risks apply to most companies, we are particularly vulnerable. The transportation industry is highly cyclical 
and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity. Our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly 
tied to the purchase and production of goods and the rate of growth of global trade. Our results in 2023 were adversely impacted by 
lower global volumes due to weak economic conditions. 
COVID-19 Pandemic and Supply Chain
The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic had varying impacts on the demand for our services and our business operations and has 
contributed to global supply chain disruptions. During the first half of 2023, we continued to be affected by COVID-19 lockdowns in 
Asia, which impacted both manufacturing and supply chains. We have now shifted to operating in a more stable post-COVID-19 
- 47 -environment with less restrictions, which resulted in consumers returning to near pre-pandemic shopping patterns during 2023. As 
global supply chains stabilized during 2023, we experienced improvements in the availability of labor and vehicles, trailers, and other 
package handling equipment.
Inflation and Interest Rates
Global inflation is well above historical levels, impacting all areas of our business. Additionally, global interest rates continue to rise 
in an effort to curb inflation. We are experiencing a decline in demand for our transportation services as inflation and interest rate 
increases are negatively affecting consumer and business spending. Additionally, we are experiencing higher costs to serve through 
higher fuel prices, wage rates, purchased transportation costs, and other direct operating expenses such as operational supplies. We 
expect inflation and high interest rates to continue to negatively affect our results in 2024. 
Fuel
We must purchase large quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles, and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our 
control and can be highly volatile. The timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental fuel 
costs through our fuel surcharges can significantly affect our operating results either positively or negatively in the short-term. Higher 
fuel prices drove an increase in yields through higher fuel surcharges and an increase in fuel expense during 2023 at all of our 
transportation segments.
Geopolitical Conflicts
Given the nature of our business and our global operations, geopolitical conflicts may adversely affect our business and results of 
operations. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February 2022 continues as of the date of this Annual Report. The 
safety of our team members in Ukraine is our top priority. As we focus on the safety of our team members, we have suspended all 
services in Ukraine and Belarus. We also temporarily idled our operations in Russia and reduced our presence to the minimum 
required for purposes of maintaining a legal presence with active transport licenses. As a result, we incurred an immaterial amount of 
severance and other related expenses in 2023, which is included in business optimization expenses at FedEx Express. While we do not 
expect this conflict to have a direct material impact on our business or results of operations, the broader consequences are adversely 
affecting the global economy and fuel prices generally and may also have the effect of heightening other risks disclosed under Part I, 
Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” See “Results of Operations and Outlook – Consolidated Results – Business Optimization and Realignment 
Costs” below for additional information.
- 48 -RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUTLOOK
Many of our operating expenses are directly affected by revenue and volume levels, and we expect these operating expenses to 
fluctuate on a year-over-year basis consistent with changes in revenue and volumes. Therefore, the discussion of operating expense 
captions focuses on the key drivers and trends affecting expenses other than those factors strictly related to changes in revenue and 
volumes. The line item “Other operating expense” includes costs associated with outside service contracts (such as temporary labor, 
security, and facility services and cargo handling), insurance, professional fees, operational supplies, and bad debt. 
Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 or ended May 31 of the year 
referenced, and comparisons are to the corresponding period of the prior year. References to our transportation segments include, 
collectively, the FedEx Express segment, the FedEx Ground segment, and the FedEx Freight segment.

- 49 -Overview 
Our operating results for 2023 were negatively affected by macroeconomic conditions, including inflation well above historical levels, 
and elevated global interest rates. In response to market conditions, we implemented cost reductions and focused on yield 
improvement to partially mitigate the effect of volume declines. Cost reductions included reducing flight hours, temporarily parking 
and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, delaying and reducing certain peak wage programs, consolidating and closing sorts, 
canceling network capacity projects, and reducing select Sunday operations. The impact of cost actions lagged volume declines, 
particularly in the first half of 2023 and at FedEx Express, resulting in elevated operating expenses relative to demand. Additionally, 
our results in the first half of 2023 were negatively impacted by service challenges at FedEx Express.
Operating income in 2023 includes $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) of asset impairment charges 
associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines at FedEx Express, and also includes $47 million 
($44 million, net of tax, or $0.17 per diluted share) of goodwill and other asset impairment charges associated with the ShopRunner, 
Inc. (“ShopRunner”) acquisition at FedEx Dataworks, Inc. (“FedEx Dataworks”). See the “Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment 
Charges” section of this MD&A for more information.
Operating income in 2023 includes $273 million ($209 million, net of tax, or $0.81 per diluted share) of expenses associated with our 
DRIVE business optimization strategy announced in the first quarter of 2023, and also includes business realignment costs of $36 
million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) associated with our workforce reduction plan in Europe announced in 
2021. Operating income in 2022 includes $278 million ($214 million, net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) of costs under this 
program. See the “Business Optimization and Realignment Costs” section of this MD&A for more information.
Operating income includes a $35 million charge ($26 million, net of tax, or $0.10 per diluted share) in 2023 related to a FedEx Ground 
legal matter and a $210 million charge ($160 million, net of tax, or $0.60 per diluted share) in 2022 related to pre- and post-judgment 
interest in connection with a separate FedEx Ground legal matter. The amounts are included in “Corporate, other, and eliminations.” 
Operating expenses in 2022 include $132 million ($103 million, net of tax, or $0.39 per diluted share) of TNT Express integration 
expenses.
Net income includes a pre-tax, noncash gain of $650 million in 2023 ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share) and a loss of 
$1.6 billion in 2022 ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share) associated with our MTM retirement plans accounting 
adjustments. See the “Retirement Plans MTM Adjustments” section of this MD&A and Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements. 
Net income in 2023 includes a $46 million ($0.18 per diluted share) tax expense from a revaluation of certain foreign tax assets. In 
2022, we recognized a $142 million ($0.53 per diluted share) tax benefit related to revisions of prior-year tax estimates for actual tax 
return results. See the “Income Taxes” section of this MD&A and Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $5 billion of FedEx common stock. As part 
of the repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a bank in October 2022, which 
was completed in December 2022, to repurchase an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common stock. Share repurchases had a benefit of 
$0.34 per diluted share in 2023. See Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the “Financial Condition—
Liquidity” section of this MD&A for additional information on our stock repurchase program.

revenue per package relates to our international intra-country operations. 
(2)International freight revenue per pound relates to our international priority, economy, and airfreight services.

- 52 -Revenue 
Revenue decreased 4% in 2023 primarily due to global volume declines at all of our transportation segments, partially offset by yield 
improvement, including higher fuel surcharges. 
FedEx Express revenue decreased 7% in 2023 due to lower global volume and unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by yield 
improvement, including higher fuel surcharges. Revenue at Corporate, other, and eliminations decreased due to lower yields and 
volumes at FedEx Trade Networks Transport & Brokerage, Inc. FedEx Ground revenue and FedEx Freight revenue each increased 1% 
in 2023, primarily due to yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by lower volume. 
Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related 
engines, four Boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines, to align 
with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to 
match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 
million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. All of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in 
revenue service.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we also recorded a noncash impairment charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per 
diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to FedEx Dataworks. The key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were 
underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of 
operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. Based on these factors, our outlook for the 
business changed in the fourth quarter of 2023. We also recorded an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) 
noncash intangible asset impairment charge related to the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx Dataworks. For additional information 
regarding these impairment charges, see the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of this MD&A and Note 4 of the accompanying 
consolidated financial statements.
Business Optimization and Realignment Costs
In the second quarter of 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company’s long-term profitability. 
This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments and lower our overhead and 
support costs. We plan to consolidate our sortation facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-and-delivery routes, and optimize our 
enterprise linehaul network by moving beyond discrete collaboration to an end-to-end optimized network through Network 2.0.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, 
FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a 
unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight will continue to provide LTL freight 
transportation services as a stand-alone and separate company under Federal Express Corporation. The organizational redesign will be 
implemented in phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation 
program to improve long-term profitability.
We have announced the implementation of Network 2.0 in more than 20 markets, including the phased transition of all FedEx Ground 
operations and personnel in Canada to FedEx Express beginning in April 2024. Under Network 2.0, FedEx will continue to utilize 
both employees and contracted service providers.
We incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $273 million ($209 million, net of tax, or $0.81 per diluted 
share) in 2023. These costs were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in 
Russia. These business optimization costs are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. The identification of 
these costs as business optimization-related expenditures is subject to our disclosure controls and procedures. We expect the pre-tax 
cost of our business optimization activities to be approximately $500 million in 2024 and approximately $2.0 billion through 2025. 
The timing and amount of our business optimization expenses may change as we revise and implement our plans.
In 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan 
affected approximately 5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 
2023. We incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, 
net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs are related to certain 
employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 2023 and approximately $225 
million in 2022. The pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million through 2023. We expect 
savings from our business realignment activities to be approximately $275 million on an annualized basis beginning in 2024.

and post-judgment interest in connection with a separate FedEx Ground legal matter.
Operating income declined in 2023 primarily due to lower volumes at each of our transportation segments, partially offset by yield 
improvement, including higher fuel surcharges. Cost reduction efforts such as reducing flight hours, temporarily parking and retiring 
aircraft, improving productivity, delaying and reducing certain peak wage programs, consolidating and closing sorts, canceling 
network capacity projects, and reducing select Sunday operations partially mitigated the effects of volume declines on our results. 
Global inflation drove higher operating expenses related to salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses in 2023. In 
addition, higher self-insurance and bad debt accruals contributed to an increase in other operating expense in 2023.
We recognized $70 million of asset impairment charges associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related 
engines at FedEx Express. Our 2023 results also include $47 million of goodwill and other asset impairment charges in the fourth 
quarter of 2023 associated with the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx Dataworks. For additional information regarding these 
impairment charges, see the “Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges” and “Critical Accounting Estimates” sections of this 
MD&A and Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Fuel 
We apply a fuel surcharge on our air and ground services, most of which are adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based 
on a weekly fuel price from ten days prior to the week in which it is assessed. Some FedEx Express international fuel surcharges are 
updated on a monthly basis. We routinely review our fuel surcharges and periodically update the tables used to determine our fuel 
surcharges at all of our transportation segments. 
While fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many 
individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components include the mix of 
services sold, the base price, and extra service charges we obtain for these services and level of pricing discounts offered. 
Fuel expense increased 16% during 2023 due to higher fuel prices, partially offset by a decline in fuel usage. In addition to variability 
in usage and market prices, the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences our results. For example, our contracts for jet fuel 
purchases at FedEx Express are tied to various indices, including the U.S. Gulf Coast index. While many of these indices are aligned, 
each index may fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the prices paid for jet fuel. Furthermore, under these contractual 
arrangements, approximately 70% of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week, with the remainder of 
our purchases tied primarily to the index price for the preceding month and preceding day, rather than based on daily spot rates. These 
contractual provisions mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rates on our jet fuel purchases.  
- 54 -Because of the factors described above, our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a 
significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can significantly affect our 
earnings either positively or negatively in the short-term. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Other Income and Expense 
Other retirement plans income (expense) increased primarily due to a noncash MTM gain of $650 million in 2023 compared to a $1.6 
billion loss in 2022 (described below). In addition, interest income increased $145 million in 2023 primarily due to an increase in 
interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in other income of $120 million related to changes in the value of equity investments. 
Retirement Plans MTM Adjustments 
In 2023, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash MTM gain of $650 million ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share), related to the 
year-end actuarial adjustments of pension and postretirement healthcare plans’ assets and liabilities. These actuarial adjustments were 
due to higher discount rates, partially offset by lower than expected asset returns and demographic experience.
In 2022, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash MTM loss of $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share), which includes 
a net loss of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion, net of tax, or $3.76 per diluted share) related to the year-end actuarial adjustments of pension 
and postretirement healthcare plans’ assets and liabilities. These actuarial adjustments were due to lower than expected asset returns, 
demographic experience, and an update to the mortality assumption, partially offset by higher discount rates.
Additionally, in 2022, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash MTM net loss of $260 million ($195 million, net of tax, or $0.73 per diluted 
share) in the second quarter of 2022, of which $224 million was related to the termination of the TNT Express Netherlands Pension 
Plan. Effective October 1, 2021, the responsibility of all pension assets and liabilities of this plan was transferred to a separate, multi-
employer pension plan. The remaining $36 million net loss was related to the U.S. FedEx Freight Pension Plan and consisted of a $75 
million MTM loss due to a lower discount rate in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by a $39 million curtailment gain.
For more information, see the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of this MD&A and Note 1 and Note 13 of the accompanying 
consolidated financial statements. 
Income Taxes 
Our effective tax rate was 25.9% for 2023, compared to 21.9% for 2022. The 2023 tax provision was negatively impacted by an 
expense of $46 million related to a write-down and valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credit carryforwards due to operational 
changes which impacted the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset. The 2023 tax provision was also negatively 
impacted by lower earnings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
The 2022 tax provision includes a benefit of $142 million related to revisions of prior year tax estimates for actual tax return results. 
The 2022 tax provision was also favorably impacted by changes in our corporate legal entity structure. 
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various U.S. state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by 
the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the 2016 through 2019 tax years. It is reasonably possible that certain income tax return 
proceedings will be completed during the next 12 months and could result in a change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits. 
However, we believe we have recorded adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, for any adjustments expected to 
occur. 
During 2021, we filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee challenging the validity of a tax regulation 
related to the one-time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, which was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
(“TCJA”). Our lawsuit seeks to have the court declare this regulation invalid and order the refund of overpayments of U.S. federal 
income taxes for 2018 and 2019 attributable to the denial of foreign tax credits under the regulation. We have recorded a cumulative 
benefit of $223 million through 2023 attributable to our interpretation of the TCJA and the Internal Revenue Code. On March 31, 
2023, the District Court ruled that the regulation is invalid and contradicts the plain terms of the tax code. We continue to work 
towards obtaining a final judgment for the applicable refund amounts due to the regulation being invalid. Once the District Court 
enters a final judgment, the U.S. government could file an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. If we are 
ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, we may be required to reverse the benefit previously recorded.
For more information on income taxes, see the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of this MD&A and Note 12 of the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
- 55 -Equity Investment
As of May 31, 2023, we do not have any equity investments that are material to our financial position or results of operations. For 
more information on equity investments, see Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Outlook
During 2024, we expect macroeconomic conditions to continue to negatively impact customer demand for our services. However, we 
expect operating income improvement in 2024 as a result of our DRIVE program initiatives focused on aligning our cost base with 
demand, reducing our permanent cost structure, and increasing the flexibility of our network. We expect international export yield 
declines and reduced customer demand for our U.S. freight product at FedEx Express to negatively impact revenue and operating 
income in 2024. In addition, we expect expense headwinds in 2024 related to higher global inflation and variable incentive 
compensation.
See the “Business Optimization and Realignment Costs” section of this MD&A for additional information on our DRIVE program and 
other cost savings initiatives.
Our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion from 2023, as we continue 
to reduce our capital intensity relative to revenue. We expect lower aircraft spend and reduced capacity investment to be partially 
offset by investments to optimize our networks and modernize our facilities. Our expected capital expenditures for 2024 include our 
continued investments in the expansion and modernization of the FedEx Express Indianapolis hub and modernization of the FedEx 
Express Memphis World Hub.
We will continue to evaluate our investments in critical long-term strategic projects to ensure our capital expenditures are expected to 
generate high returns on investment and are balanced with our outlook for global economic conditions. For additional details on key 
2024 capital projects, refer to the “Financial Condition – Capital Resources” and “Financial Condition – Liquidity Outlook” sections 
of this MD&A.
The uncertainty of a slowing global economy, global inflation well above historical levels, geopolitical challenges including the 
ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the impact these factors will have on the rate of growth of global trade, supply 
chains, fuel prices, and our business in particular, make any expectations for 2024 inherently less certain. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” 
for more information.
See “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, “Trends Affecting Our Business”, and “Critical Accounting Estimates” 
for a discussion of these and other potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance.
Seasonality of Business 
Our businesses are cyclical in nature, as seasonal fluctuations affect volumes, revenue, and earnings. Historically, the U.S. express 
package business experiences an increase in volumes in late November and December. International business, particularly in the Asia-
to-U.S. market, peaks in October and November in advance of the U.S. holiday sales season. Our first and third fiscal quarters, 
because they are summer vacation and post winter-holiday seasons, have historically experienced lower volumes relative to other 
periods. Normally, the fall is the busiest shipping period for FedEx Ground, while late December, June and July are the slowest 
periods. For FedEx Freight, the spring and fall are the busiest periods and the latter part of December through February is the slowest 
period. Shipment levels, operating costs, and earnings for each of our companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather, 
particularly the impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE 
See Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance.
- 56 -REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Services, constitute our 
reportable segments. Our reportable segments include the following businesses: 
FedEx Express Segment FedEx Express (express transportation, small-package ground delivery, and freight 
transportation)
FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. (time-critical transportation)
FedEx Ground Segment FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery)
FedEx Freight Segment FedEx Freight (LTL freight transportation)
FedEx Services Segment FedEx Services (sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer 
service, technical support, billing and collection services, and back-office functions)
In the fourth quarter of 2023, FedEx announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, 
FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a 
unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the respected FedEx brand. The organizational redesign will be implemented in 
phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. During the implementation process in fiscal 2024, each of our current 
reportable segments will continue to have discrete financial information that will be regularly reviewed when evaluating performance 
and making resource allocation decisions, and aligns with our management reporting structure and our internal financial reporting. In 
the first quarter of fiscal 2025, when the consolidation plan has been completed, we expect to begin reporting a resegmented structure 
that will align with an updated management reporting structure and how management will evaluate performance and make resource 
allocation decisions under one FedEx.
FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT
The FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our operating segments, and we allocate all of the net operating 
costs of the FedEx Services segment to reflect the full cost of operating our businesses in the results of those segments. We review and 
evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of FedEx Services segment 
allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance is evaluated based on the effect of its total allocated net operating costs on 
our operating segments. 
Operating expenses for each of our transportation segments include the allocations from the FedEx Services segment to the respective 
transportation segments. These allocations include charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating 
companies. The allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as relative revenue or estimated services provided. We 
believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. Our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, 
as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses.
CORPORATE, OTHER, AND ELIMINATIONS
Corporate and other includes corporate headquarters costs for executive officers and certain legal and finance functions, including 
certain other costs and credits not attributed to our core business, as well as certain costs associated with developing our “innovate 
digitally” strategic pillar through our FedEx Dataworks operating segment. FedEx Dataworks is focused on creating solutions to 
transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members. ShopRunner, Inc. was merged into FedEx 
Dataworks during 2023.
Also included in Corporate and other is the FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. operating segment, which provides an array of 
document and business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses, and the FedEx Logistics, 
Inc. operating segment, which provides integrated supply chain management solutions, specialty transportation, customs brokerage, 
and global ocean and air freight forwarding. 
The results of Corporate, other, and eliminations are not allocated to the other business segments.
- 57 -In 2023, the decrease in operating results in Corporate, other, and eliminations was primarily due to lower operating income at FedEx 
Logistics due to decreased revenue and an increase in bad debt, partially offset by decreased purchased transportation expense. 
Additionally, operating results in Corporate, other, and eliminations were negatively impacted by higher professional fees and outside 
service contract spend at FedEx Dataworks. The comparison of operating loss between 2023 and 2022 at Corporate, other, and 
eliminations is affected by goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $47 million associated with the ShopRunner acquisition at 
FedEx Dataworks in 2023.
Certain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx companies outside their reportable 
segment in order to optimize our resources. For example, during 2023 FedEx Ground provided delivery support for certain FedEx 
Express packages as part of our last-mile optimization efforts, and FedEx Freight provided road and intermodal support for both 
FedEx Ground and FedEx Express. In addition, FedEx Express is working with FedEx Logistics to secure air charters and other cargo 
space for U.S. customers. Billings for such services are based on negotiated rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are 
reflected as revenue of the billing segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such intersegment 
revenue and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results and are not separately identified in the following segment information 
because the amounts are not material.
- 58 -FEDEX EXPRESS SEGMENT 
FedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight including 
priority, deferred, and economy services, which provide delivery on a time-definite or day-definite basis. The following table

FedEx Express Segment Revenue
FedEx Express segment revenue decreased 7% in 2023 primarily due to decreased global volume and unfavorable exchange rates, 
partially offset by yield improvement.
Total average daily package volume decreased 10% in 2023, and total average daily freight pounds decreased 14% in 2023, due to 
reduced demand for our services, primarily resulting from macroeconomic conditions. Volume declines were partially offset by yield 
improvement, including increases in composite package yield of 6% and composite freight yield of 2% in 2023. The 6% increase in 
composite package yield was primarily due to a U.S. domestic package yield increase of 12%, driven by higher base yields and fuel 
surcharges. Unfavorable exchange rates negatively impacted all international package and freight product yields in 2023.
FedEx Express Segment Operating Income 
FedEx Express segment operating income decreased 64% in 2023 primarily due to global volume declines, partially offset by yield 
improvement and lower operating expenses. During 2023, we implemented cost reductions to mitigate the impact of volume declines, 
including reducing flight hours, temporarily parking and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, and consolidating routes and closing 
sorts. The impact of these reductions, while improving throughout the year, lagged volume declines, and operating expenses remained 
high relative to demand. Currency exchange rates had a negative effect on revenue and a positive effect on expenses, resulting in a 
slightly negative effect on operating income in 2023. 
- 60 -Fuel expense increased 16% in 2023 due to a 27% increase in fuel prices, partially offset by a 9% decline in total fuel gallons. 
Purchased transportation expense decreased 11% in 2023 primarily due to favorable exchange rates and lower utilization, partially 
offset by higher rates charged by third-party providers. Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 3% in 2023 primarily due to 
decreased staffing to align with lower volume, favorable currency exchange rates, and lower variable incentive compensation, 
partially offset by increased wage rates. Rentals and landing fees expense decreased 10% in 2023 primarily due to decreased aircraft 
leases and favorable currency exchange rates. Other operating expense decreased 2% in 2023 primarily due to favorable currency 
exchange rates and lower outside service contract expense, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. Maintenance and repairs 
expense decreased 6% in 2023 primarily due to lower aircraft maintenance resulting from an increase in aircraft temporarily parked.
During 2023, we recorded asset impairment charges of $70 million associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft 
and related engines. See “Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges” above for more information. Additionally, FedEx Express 
segment results include business realignment costs of $36 million in 2023 associated with our workforce reduction plan in Europe. We 
recognized $278 million of costs in 2022 under this program. FedEx Express segment results also include business optimization costs 
of $11 million in 2023, which includes costs associated with idling our business in Russia. See the “Business Optimization and 
Realignment Costs” section of this MD&A for more information. 
FedEx Express segments results include $115 million of TNT Express integration expenses in 2022.
FEDEX GROUND SEGMENT 
FedEx Ground service offerings include day-certain delivery to businesses in the U.S. and Canada and to 100% of U.S. residences.

FedEx Ground Segment Revenue
FedEx Ground segment revenue increased 1% in 2023 primarily due to yield improvement, partially offset by lower volumes.
FedEx Ground yield increased 10% in 2023 primarily due to higher fuel and other surcharges, and a mix shift towards higher-yielding 
business-to-consumer products. Total average daily volume decreased 7% in 2023 due to reduced demand for our services, primarily 
resulting from macroeconomic conditions.
- 61 -FedEx Ground Segment Operating Income 
FedEx Ground segment operating income increased 19% in 2023 primarily due to yield improvement, including higher fuel 
surcharges, partially offset by lower volume and higher other operating and rentals expense. The 2023 results benefited from certain 
cost reductions to mitigate the effect of volume declines, primarily a delay and reduction in peak wage programs, the consolidation 
and closing of certain sort and linehaul operations, cancellation of network capacity projects, and reduced Sunday delivery coverage. 
Purchased transportation expense decreased 4% in 2023 primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by lower productivity and 
higher fuel prices. Salaries and employee benefits decreased 5% in 2023 primarily due to decreased staffing to align with lower 
volume and lower variable incentive compensation, partially offset by higher wage rates. Other operating expense increased 11% in 
2023 primarily due to higher self-insurance accruals and higher outside service contracts expense. Rentals and depreciation expense 
increased 18% and 11%, respectively, in 2023 due to the completion of previously committed multi-year expansion projects.
FEDEX FREIGHT SEGMENT

FedEx Freight Segment Revenue 
FedEx Freight segment revenue increased 1% in 2023 primarily due to yield improvement, partially offset by lower volumes. 
Revenue per shipment increased 14% in 2023 primarily due to continued focus on revenue quality, including higher fuel surcharges, 
partially offset by lower weight per shipment. Average daily shipments decreased 11% in 2023 due to reduced demand for our 
services, primarily resulting from macroeconomic conditions. 
- 62 -FedEx Freight Segment Operating Income 
FedEx Freight segment operating income increased 16% in 2023 driven by yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges, 
partially offset by lower volumes. Additionally, FedEx Freight results were positively affected by initiatives to align costs to volumes 
and a gain on the sale of a facility during the third quarter of 2023.
In 2023, FedEx Freight continued to manage linehaul costs by increasing utilization of company linehaul, resulting in a shift of costs 
from purchased transportation to salaries and employee benefits expense. Purchased transportation expense decreased 25% in 2023 
primarily due to lower volumes and reduced utilization due to the shift to company linehaul. Salaries and employee benefits expense 
decreased 3% in 2023 primarily due to decreased staffing to align with lower volume and lower variable incentive compensation, 
partially offset by higher wage rates and increased company linehaul utilization. Fuel expense increased 13% in 2023 primarily due to 
increased fuel prices, partially offset by lower volume. Other operating expense increased 12% in 2023 primarily due to higher self-
insurance accruals and bad debt expense. Maintenance and repairs expense increased 16% in 2023 primarily due to higher costs 
associated with vehicle parts, outside vendor labor, and facility maintenance.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $1.0 billion in 2023 primarily due to lower net 
income (net of noncash items), as well as a decrease in accounts payable and legal settlements, partially offset by a decrease in 
accounts receivable.
Cash Used in Investing Activities . Capital expenditures were 9% lower in 2023 primarily due to decreased spending on aircraft. See 
“Capital Resources” below for a more detailed discussion of capital expenditures during 2023.
Financing Activities . In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $5 billion of FedEx 
common stock. As part of the repurchase program, we completed an ASR agreement with a bank in the third quarter of 2023 to 
repurchase an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common stock. A total of 9.2 million shares were repurchased under the agreement. 
- 63 -During 2022, as part of the repurchase program, we completed an ASR agreement with a bank to repurchase an aggregate of $1.5 
billion of our common stock, and 6.1 million shares were delivered. We also repurchased an additional 2.8 million shares of our 
common stock during 2022. 
The following table provides a summary of repurchases of our common stock for the periods ended May 31 (dollars in millions,

privately negotiated transactions. The program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
See Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.
CAPITAL RESOURCES 
Our operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft, package handling and sort equipment, 
vehicles and trailers, technology, and facilities. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including 
pre-existing contractual commitments, anticipated volume growth, domestic and international economic conditions, new or enhanced 
services, geographical expansion of services, availability of satisfactory financing, and actions of regulatory authorities. 
The following table compares capital expenditures by asset category and reportable segment for the years ended May 31 (in millions):

GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION
We are providing the following information in compliance with Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X, “Financial Disclosures about 
Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities” with respect to our senior unsecured debt securities and Pass-Through Certificates, 
Series 2020-1AA (the “Certificates”).
The $19.2 billion principal amount of the senior unsecured notes were issued by FedEx under a shelf registration statement and are 
guaranteed by certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of FedEx (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”). FedEx owns, directly or indirectly, 100% 
of each Guarantor Subsidiary. The guarantees are (1) unsecured obligations of the respective Guarantor Subsidiary, (2) rank equally 
with all of their other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and (3) are full and unconditional and joint and several. If we sell, 
transfer, or otherwise dispose of all of the capital stock or all or substantially all of the assets of a Guarantor Subsidiary to any person 
that is not an affiliate of FedEx, the guarantee of that Guarantor Subsidiary will terminate, and holders of debt securities will no longer 
have a direct claim against such subsidiary under the guarantee.
- 64 -Additionally, FedEx fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment obligation of FedEx Express in respect of the $840 million 
principal amount of the Certificates. See Note 6 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
regarding the terms of the Certificates.
The following tables present summarized financial information for FedEx (as Parent) and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK
In response to current business and economic conditions as referenced above in the “Outlook” section of this MD&A, we are 
continuing to actively manage and optimize our capital allocation to mitigate the impact of the slowing economy, inflationary 
pressures, and geopolitical conflicts. We held $6.9 billion in cash at May 31, 2023 and have $3.5 billion in available liquidity under 
our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (the “Five-Year Credit Agreement) and $1.5 billion three-year credit agreement (the 
“Three-Year Credit Agreement” and together with the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”), and we believe that 
our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and available financing sources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs, 
which include operational requirements, expected capital expenditures, voluntary pension contributions, dividend payments, and stock 
repurchases.
- 65 -As announced on June 20, 2023, we expect to repurchase $2.0 billion of our common stock in 2024. We executed an ASR agreement 
with a bank in June 2023 to repurchase an aggregate of $500 million of our common stock with a completion date no later than August 
2023.
Our cash and cash equivalents balance at May 31, 2023 includes $2.6 billion of cash in foreign jurisdictions associated with our 
permanent reinvestment strategy. We are able to access the majority of this cash without a material tax cost and do not believe that the 
indefinite reinvestment of these funds impairs our ability to meet our U.S. domestic debt or working capital obligations.
Our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion from 2023, as we continue 
to reduce our capital intensity relative to revenue. We expect lower aircraft spend and reduced capacity investment to be partially 
offset by investments to optimize our networks and modernize our facilities. Included within our expected 2024 capital expenditures 
are our continued investments in the expansion and modernization of the FedEx Express Indianapolis hub and modernization of the 
FedEx Express Memphis World Hub, which are expected to total $1.5 billion each over the life of each project. Our expected capital 
expenditures for 2024 also include $1.5 billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payments toward future 
aircraft deliveries at FedEx Express. 
We have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures, which 
consist of debt obligations, lease obligations, and obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. Refer to Note 6, 
Note 7, and Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information. In addition, we have certain tax 
positions that are further discussed in Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We do not have any guarantees 
or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact 
on our financial condition or liquidity. 
We have several aircraft modernization programs under way that are supported by the purchase of Boeing 777 Freighter and Boeing 
767-300 Freighter aircraft. These aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and 
these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. Our ability to delay 
the timing of these aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements. 
We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that allows us to sell, in one or 
more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows pass-through trusts formed by 
FedEx Express to sell, in one or more future offerings, pass-through certificates.
The Five-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2026 and includes a $250 million letter of credit sublimit. The Three-Year Credit 
Agreement expires in March 2025. The Credit Agreements are available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs. See Note 
6 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the terms and significant covenants of the Credit 
Agreements. 
We made a voluntary contribution of $200 million to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans (“U.S. Pension Plans”) in June 
2023 and anticipate making $600 million of additional voluntary contributions during the remainder of 2024. There are currently no 
required minimum contributions to our U.S. Pension Plans based on current funded status and credit balance due to cumulative excess 
voluntary pension contributions, which exceeds $3.0 billion. The credit balance is subtracted from plan assets to determine the 
minimum funding requirements. Therefore, we could eliminate all required contributions to our principal U.S. Pension Plans for 
several years if we were to choose to waive part of that credit balance in any given year. Our U.S. Pension Plans have ample funds to 
meet expected benefit payments.  
On April 5, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.26 per share of common stock. The dividend was 
paid on July 3, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 12, 2023. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject 
to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis. There are no 
material restrictions on our ability to declare dividends, nor are there any material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to 
transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.
Standard & Poor’s has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of BBB, a Certificates rating of AA-, a commercial paper 
rating of A-2, and a ratings outlook of “stable.” Moody’s Investors Service has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2, a 
Certificates rating of Aa3, a commercial paper rating of P-2, and a ratings outlook of “stable.” If our credit ratings drop, our interest 
expense may increase. If our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, we may have difficulty utilizing the commercial 
paper market. If our senior unsecured debt credit ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may become limited. 
- 66 -CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires 
management to make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In 
many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the 
application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the 
financial statements of a complex, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require 
adjustment based on changing circumstances and new or better information. 
The estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or 
application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our results of operations and financial condition. Management has 
discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of 
Directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm. 
RETIREMENT PLANS
The rules for pension accounting are complex and can produce volatility in our earnings, financial condition, and liquidity. Our 
defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management’s 
assumptions for expected returns on assets (“EROA”), discount rate, and demographic experience such as salary increases, expected 
retirement, mortality, employee turnover, and future increases in healthcare costs. Differences between these assumptions and actual 
experience are recognized in our earnings through MTM accounting. The components of the MTM adjustments for the period ended 
May 31 are as follows (presented as (gain) loss in millions): 
2023 2022
Actual versus expected return on assets $ 2,492 $ 5,109
Discount rate change (3,395 ) (4,486 )
Demographic experience:
   Current year actuarial loss 142 504

Termination of TNT Express Netherlands pension plan — 224
Pension plan amendments, including curtailment gains 1 (87)
Total MTM (gain) loss $ (650)$ 1,578
Our annual MTM adjustment is highly sensitive to the discount rate and EROA assumptions, which are as follows: 
U.S. Pension PlansInternational

The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 50-basis-point change in the EROA and discount rate assumptions for our 
largest pension plan and the resulting increase (decrease) in our projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) as of May 31, 2023 and expense

See Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our retirement plans. 
- 67 -INCOME TAXES
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income taxes are a function of our income, tax 
planning opportunities available to us, statutory tax rates, and the income tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. 
These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by us and the respective governmental taxing authorities. As a 
result, significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating 
uncertainties. Also, our effective tax rate is significantly affected by the earnings generated in each jurisdiction, so unexpected 
fluctuations in the geographic mix of earnings could significantly impact our tax rate. Our intercompany transactions are based on 
globally accepted transfer pricing principles, which align profits with the business operations and functions of the various legal entities 
in our international business.  
We evaluate our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. These evaluations are based on 
factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax laws or their interpretations, audit activity, and 
changes in our business. In addition, management considers the advice of third parties in making conclusions regarding tax 
consequences. 
Tax contingencies arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rules throughout the many jurisdictions in which we operate. Despite 
our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. We 
record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. 
To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on the 
technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of 
being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant 
judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual 
taxes payable upon settlement. 
Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets 
arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net 
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the 
adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating 
earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates to make this determination, and as a 
result there is a risk that these estimates will have to be revised as new information is received. To the extent we do not consider it 
more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. We believe we will generate 
sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance 
sheets that are not subject to valuation allowances. We record the taxes for global intangible low-taxed income as a period cost.
Our income tax positions are based on currently enacted tax laws. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the 
IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant 
accounting guidance. 
For more information, see the “Income Taxes” section of this MD&A and Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements. 
SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS 
Our self-insurance reserves are established for estimates of ultimate loss on all incurred claims, including incurred-but-not-reported 
claims. Components of our self-insurance reserves included in this critical accounting estimate are workers’ compensation claims, 
vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. These 
reserves are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. These estimates include 
judgment about severity of claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. The use of any 
estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the 
ultimate cost is known, which may be several years.
We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in  
accident frequency and severity, healthcare costs, insurance retention levels, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for 
these liabilities and affect our results of operations. Self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet for the period ended May 31 
are as follows (in millions): 
2023 2022
Short-Term $ 1,730 $ 1,646
Long-Term 3,339 2,889
   Total $ 5,069 $ 4,535
- 68 -A five-percent reduction or improvement in the assumed claim severity used to estimate our self-insurance accruals would result in an 
increase or decrease of approximately $250 million in our reserves and expenses as of and for the year ended May 31, 2023. For more 
information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS 
USEFUL LIVES AND SALVAGE VALUES . Our business is capital intensive, with approximately 60% of our owned assets invested in 
our transportation and information system infrastructures. 
The depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, 
requires management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long 
periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 30 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our 
estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. These 
evaluations consider usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors that affect the useful life of an asset. This evaluation may result 
in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment. 
For our aircraft, we consider actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and future volume projections in estimating the 
useful lives and expected salvage values. We typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of our aircraft in cargo 
configuration, which results in little to no value at the end of their useful life. These estimates affect the amount of depreciation 
expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Changes in the estimated lives of assets 
will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods and could have a material impact on 
our results of operations (as described below). Historically, gains and losses on disposals of operating equipment have not been 
material. However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in business levels, technological obsolescence, 
accident frequency, regulatory changes, and other factors beyond our control. 
IMPAIRMENT.  As of May 31, 2023, the FedEx Express global air network included a fleet of 700 aircraft (including 293 
supplemental aircraft) that provide delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through a wide range of 
U.S. and international shipping services. While certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic areas (U.S. versus international), we 
operate an integrated global network, and utilize our aircraft and other modes of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery 
while maintaining our service commitments to our customers. Because of the integrated nature of our global network, our aircraft are 
interchangeable across routes and geographies, giving us flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic 
conditions and maintain and modify aircraft as needed. 
Because of the lengthy lead times for aircraft manufacture and modifications, we must anticipate volume levels and plan our fleet 
requirements years in advance, and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. Furthermore, the timing and 
availability of certain used aircraft types (particularly those with better fuel efficiency) may create limited opportunities to acquire 
these aircraft at favorable prices in advance of our capacity needs. These activities create risks that asset capacity may exceed demand. 
At May 31, 2023, we had three purchased aircraft that were not yet placed into service. 
We evaluate our long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted 
cash flows to be generated by that asset group are less than the carrying amounts of the asset group and may not be recoverable. If the 
cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. We operate integrated transportation 
networks, and accordingly, cash flows for most of our operating assets are assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset level 
for our analysis of impairment. Further, decisions about capital investments are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network 
rather than the return on an individual asset. We make decisions to remove certain long-lived assets from service based on projections 
of reduced capacity needs or lower operating costs of newer aircraft types, and those decisions may result in an impairment charge. 
Assets held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values less costs to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the 
asset and certain other criteria are met. The fair value determinations for such aircraft may require management estimates, as there 
may not be active markets for some of these aircraft. Such estimates are subject to revision from period to period.  
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related 
engines, four Boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines, to align 
with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to 
match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 
million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. All of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in 
revenue service.
In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2023, FedEx Express made the decision to accelerate the retirement of 46 MD-11F aircraft and 
related engines to aid in our fleet modernization, improve our global network, and better align air network capacity of FedEx Express 
to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a result of this decision, we expect a net increase of approximately $12 million 
in depreciation expense in 2024 with the expense impact in 2025 being immaterial. 
- 69 -In the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and 
adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels. Temporarily idled assets are classified 
as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are 
assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis. The criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently 
removed from service (and, as a result, is potentially impaired) include, but are not limited to, our global economic outlook and the 
impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons; the 
introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service 
expansion activities. At May 31, 2023, we had 11 aircraft temporarily idled. These aircraft have been idled for an average of five 
months and are expected to return to revenue service in order to meet expected demand. 
During the fourth quarter of 2023, we reviewed long-lived assets at FedEx Dataworks for impairment. Based on our reviews, we 
recognized an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) asset impairment charge related to an intangible asset 
from the ShopRunner acquisition. For more information, see Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
LEASES . We utilize operating leases to finance certain of our aircraft, facilities, and equipment. Such arrangements typically shift the 
risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor. In accordance with the new lease accounting 
standard adopted in 2020, we had $18 billion in operating lease liabilities and $17 billion in related right-of-use assets on the balance 
sheet as of May 31, 2023. The weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at May 31, 2023 was 9.5 
years. 
Our leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease. We reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the 
economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options, and how they align with our operating strategy. Therefore, 
substantially all the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the 
measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the options to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement. 
Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized in the right-to-use asset and lease liability on the 
consolidated balance sheets. 
The lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease 
payments not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which we would borrow, on a collateralized 
basis, over the term of a lease in the applicable currency environment. The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not 
determinable in transactions where we are the lessee.
The determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a finance lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates 
primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life. In addition, our evaluation includes ensuring we 
properly account for build-to-suit lease arrangements and making judgments about whether various forms of lessee involvement 
during the construction period allow the lessee to control the underlying leased asset during the construction period. We believe we 
have well-defined and controlled processes for making these evaluations, including obtaining third-party appraisals for material 
transactions to assist us in making these evaluations. 
GOODWILL . We had $6.4 billion of recorded goodwill at May 31, 2023 and $6.5 billion of recorded goodwill at May 31, 2022 from 
our business acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Several factors 
give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefits from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce 
of the acquired business. 
Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment 
that requires management judgment and the use of estimates to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting 
unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit 
and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity may resume performing the qualitative 
assessment in any subsequent period. We performed both qualitative and quantitative assessments of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 
2023 and 2022. This included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair 
value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies (principally the income or market approach classified as Level 3 within the 
fair value hierarchy) incorporating market participant considerations and management’s assumptions on revenue growth rates, 
operating margins, discount rates, and expected capital expenditures. Estimates used by management can significantly affect the 
outcome of the impairment test. Changes in forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates. 
As part of our qualitative assessment, we consider changes in the macroeconomic environment such as the general economic 
conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and other developments in equity and credit 
markets. 
- 70 -The market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics 
such as operating value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We apply judgment to select appropriate 
comparison companies based on the business operations, growth, size, and risk profile relative to our reporting units. Changes to our 
selection of comparable companies may result in changes to the estimates of fair value of our reporting units.
In connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded an impairment 
charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to our FedEx Dataworks 
reporting unit. The key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 
2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth 
anticipated at the time of acquisition. Based on these factors, our outlook for the business changed in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Our other reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight. We evaluated 
these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded 
their carrying values as of the end of 2023 and 2022; therefore, we do not believe that any of these reporting units were impaired as of 
the balance sheet dates.
LEGAL AND OTHER  CONTINGENCIES 
We are subject to various loss contingencies in connection with our operations. Contingent liabilities are difficult to measure, as their 
measurement is subject to multiple factors that are not easily predicted or projected. Further, additional complexity in measuring these 
liabilities arises due to the various jurisdictions in which these matters occur, which makes our ability to predict their outcome highly 
uncertain. Moreover, different accounting rules must be employed to account for these items based on the nature of the contingency. 
Accordingly, significant management judgment is required to assess these matters and to make determinations about the measurement 
of a liability, if any. Certain pending loss contingencies are described in Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, of individual matters or groups of related matters not 
specifically described in Note 18 is not expected to be material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The 
following describes our methods and associated processes for evaluating these matters. 
Because of the complex environment in which we operate, we are subject to numerous legal proceedings and claims, including those 
relating to general commercial matters, governmental enforcement actions, employment-related claims, vehicle accidents, and FedEx 
Ground’s service providers. Accounting guidance for contingencies requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency, such as a 
non-income tax or other legal proceeding or claim, when it is probable (i.e., the future event or events are likely to occur) that a loss 
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. This guidance also requires disclosure of a loss contingency 
matter when, in management’s judgment, a material loss is reasonably possible or probable. 
During the preparation of our financial statements, we evaluate our contingencies to determine whether it is probable, reasonably 
possible, or remote that a liability has been incurred. A loss is recognized for all contingencies deemed probable and estimable, 
regardless of amount. For unresolved contingencies with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible, we 
evaluate whether a potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.
Our evaluation of these matters is the result of a comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of a loss or 
disclosure of these contingencies is made in a timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel, as well as external 
counsel where applicable. The process includes regular communications during each quarter and scheduled meetings shortly before 
the completion of our financial statements to evaluate any new legal proceedings and the status of existing matters.
In determining whether a loss should be accrued or a loss contingency disclosed, we evaluate, among other factors: 
• the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding (e.g., the lengthy and complex 
nature of class-action matters); 
• the procedural status of each matter; 
• any opportunities to dispose of a lawsuit on its merits before trial (i.e., motion to dismiss or for summary judgment); 
• the amount of time remaining before a trial date; 
• the status of discovery; 
• the status of settlement, arbitration, or mediation proceedings; and 
• our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial. 
- 71 -In reaching our conclusions with respect to accrual of a loss or loss contingency disclosure, we take a holistic view of each matter 
based on these factors and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements. Uncertainty with respect to an 
individual factor or combination of these factors may impact our decisions related to accrual or disclosure of a loss contingency, 
including a conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or a meaningful range of possible loss. We update 
our disclosures to reflect our most current understanding of the contingencies at the time we issue our financial statements. However, 
events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs materially from our 
previously estimated liability or range of possible loss. 
Despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingencies, we believe that our processes are robust and 
thorough and provide a consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingencies for proper 
accounting recognition and disclosure. 
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
INTEREST RATES. While we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates, we do not have significant 
exposure to changing interest rates on our long-term debt. As disclosed in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements, we had outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt (exclusive of finance leases) with an estimated fair value of $17.5 billion at 
May 31, 2023 and outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt (exclusive of finance leases) with an estimated fair value of $18.8 billion at 
May 31, 2022. Market risk for long-term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% 
increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately $743 million as of May 31, 2023 and approximately $518 million as of 
May 31, 2022. The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates 
offered for debt with similar terms and maturities. 
We have interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations. Changes in interest rates impact our 
liabilities associated with these retirement plans, as well as the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized. 
Declines in the value of plan assets could diminish the funded status of our pension plans and potentially increase our requirement to 
make contributions to the plans. Substantial investment losses on plan assets would also increase net pension expense. See the 
“Critical Accounting Estimates — Retirement Plans” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of 
Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more information.
FOREIGN CURRENCY.  While we are a global provider of transportation, e-commerce, and business services, the majority of our 
transactions during the periods presented in this Annual Report are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency 
exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the euro, Chinese yuan, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, 
Australian dollar, Japanese yen, and Mexican peso. Historically, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is more significant with 
respect to our revenue than our expenses, as a significant portion of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, such as aircraft and 
fuel expenses. Foreign currency fluctuations had a slightly negative impact on operating income in 2023 and a slightly positive impact 
on operating income in 2022. However, favorable foreign currency fluctuations also may have had an offsetting impact on the price 
we obtained or the demand for our services, which is not quantifiable. At May 31, 2023, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in 
the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in expected 
operating income of approximately $236 million for 2024. This theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change 
in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar, which is not consistent with our actual experience in foreign currency transactions. In 
addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign 
currency sales price as competitors’ services become more or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices. 
We maintain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuations related to probable future transactions and cash 
flows denominated in currencies other than the currency of the transacting entity which impacts our exposure to foreign currency 
exchange risk. These derivatives are not designated as hedges and are accounted for at fair value with any profit or loss recorded in 
income, which was immaterial for 2023 and 2022. 
COMMODITY.  While we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and vehicle fuel, this risk is largely mitigated by our indexed 
fuel surcharges. For additional discussion of our indexed fuel surcharges, see the “Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated 
Results — Fuel” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.” 
- 72 -ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL 
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting 
includes, among other things, defined policies and procedures for conducting and governing our business, sophisticated information 
systems for processing transactions, and a properly staffed, professional internal audit department. Mechanisms are in place to monitor 
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and actions are taken to correct all identified deficiencies. Our 
procedures for financial reporting include the active involvement of senior management, our Audit and Finance Committee, and our 
staff of highly qualified financial and legal professionals. 
Management, with the participation of our principal executive and financial officers, assessed our internal control over financial 
reporting as of May 31, 2023, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control 
— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the 
COSO criteria). 
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 
2023. 
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP 
(PCAOB ID: 42), the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited the Company’s consolidated financial 
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Ernst & Young LLP’s report on the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

FedEx Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited FedEx Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 
framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, FedEx Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective 
internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of 
income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in common stockholders’ investment for each of the three years in the period 
ended May 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated July 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of 
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based 
on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the 
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such 
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FedEx Corporation (the Company) as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, 
the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in common stockholders’ investment 
for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated 
financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Company at May 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended May 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal 
Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 
framework) and our report dated July 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to 
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to 
error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included 
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included 
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial 
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or 
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or 
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the 
critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Pension Projected Benefit Obligation
Description 
of the MatterAt May 31, 2023, the Company’s aggregated projected benefit obligation for U.S. pension 
plans was $26.4 billion and exceeded the $24.8 billion fair value of U.S. pension plan assets, 
resulting in an unfunded U.S. pension obligation of $1.6 billion. The net periodic benefit 
income for the year ended May 31, 2023 for the U.S. pension plans was $313 million. As 
explained in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company sponsors defined 
benefit pension plans that provide retirement benefits to certain U.S. employees. The 
Company’s projected benefit obligation for the U.S. pension plans is measured using actuarial 
techniques that reflect management’s assumptions for discount rate, future salary increases, 
employee turnover, mortality, and retirement ages.
Auditing the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans was complex due to the 
highly judgmental nature and significant effect of the discount rate used in the measurement 
process. The discount rate is developed by utilizing the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-
grade corporate bonds that match cash flows to benefit payments, limit the concentration by 
industry and issuer, and apply screening criteria to exclude bonds with a call feature unless 
they have a low probability of being called. 
- 75 -How We 
Addressed 
the Matter in 
Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of 
controls over management’s process for estimating the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. 
pension plans, including management’s review of the significant assumptions and assessment 
of the data inputs provided to the actuary. 
To test the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans, our audit procedures 
included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used, the significant actuarial 
assumptions described above, and the underlying data used by the Company. We compared the 
actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends and evaluated the change in the 
projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans from the prior year due to the change in 
service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other 
activities. In addition, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating 
management’s methodology for determining the discount rate. As part of this assessment, we 
compared management’s selected discount rate to an independently developed range of 
reasonable discount rates. Additionally, we compared the projected future cash flows of the 
U.S. pension plans to the prior year projections and compared the current year benefits paid to 
the prior year projected cash flows. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the 
underlying data, including the participant data provided to management’s actuarial specialists.
Valuation of Self-Insurance Accruals
Description 
of the MatterAt May 31, 2023, the Company’s self-insurance accruals reflected in the balance sheet were 
$5.1 billion. As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, self-insurance 
accruals include costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, vehicle accidents, 
property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee 
disability programs. These accrued liabilities are primarily based on the actuarially estimated 
cost of claims, including incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR) claims.
Auditing the Company’s self-insurance accruals is complex due to the significant 
measurement uncertainty inherent to the estimate, the application of management judgment, 
and the use of various actuarial methods. In addition, the accruals are sensitive due to the 
volume of claims and the amount of time that can pass before the final cost is known.
How We 
Addressed 
the Matter in 
Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of 
controls over management’s process for estimating self-insurance accruals, including 
management’s review of the assumptions used, results of calculations and assessment of data 
underlying the accruals.
To evaluate the self-insurance accruals, our audit procedures included, among others, testing 
the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims data used by the Company. We 
involved our actuarial specialists to assist in our evaluation of the methodologies applied by 
management in establishing the actuarially determined accrual and in reviewing the 
Company’s reinsurance contracts by policy year to assess the Company’s self-insured 
retentions, deductibles, and coverage limits. We compared the Company’s accrued amounts to 
a range developed by our actuarial specialists. Furthermore, we compared the Company’s 
historical estimates of expected incurred losses to actual losses experienced during the current 
year.

- 82 -NOTE 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, 
and business services through companies competing collectively, operating collaboratively, and innovating digitally as one FedEx. 
Our primary operating companies are Federal Express Corporation (“FedEx Express”), the world’s largest express transportation 
company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (“FedEx Ground”), a leading North American provider of small-package ground 
delivery services; and FedEx Freight Corporation (“FedEx Freight”), a leading North American provider of less-than-truckload 
(“LTL”) freight transportation services. These companies represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, 
Inc. (“FedEx Services”), constitute our reportable segments. Our FedEx Services segment provides sales, marketing, information 
technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain back-office functions 
that support our operating segments. 
FISCAL YEARS . Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 or ended May 31 of 
the year referenced. 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FedEx and its subsidiaries, 
substantially all of which are wholly owned. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in 
consolidation. 
REVENUE RECOGNITION . 
Satisfaction of Performance Obligation
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the basis of revenue 
recognition in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). To determine the proper revenue recognition 
method for contracts, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract and 
whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. For most of our contracts, 
the customer contracts with us to provide distinct services within a single contract, primarily transportation services. Substantially all 
of our contracts with customers for transportation services include only one performance obligation, the transportation services 
themselves. However, if a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, we allocate the total transaction price to 
each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services 
underlying each performance obligation. We frequently sell standard transportation services with observable standalone sales prices. 
In these instances, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the standalone selling price.
For transportation services, revenue is recognized over time as we perform the services in the contract because of the continuous 
transfer of control to the customer. Our customers receive the benefit of our services as the goods are transported from one location to 
another. If we were unable to complete delivery to the final location, another entity would not need to reperform the transportation 
service already performed. As control transfers over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion 
of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on 
the nature of the products or services to be provided. We use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our package delivery contracts 
because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost 
measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total 
estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenue, including ancillary or accessorial fees and reductions for 
estimated customer incentives, is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Costs to fulfill include labor and other direct costs and 
an allocation of indirect costs. For our FedEx Freight and freight forwarding contracts, an output method of progress based on time-in-
transit is utilized as the timing of costs incurred does not best depict the transfer of control to the customer. 
We also provide customized customer-specific solutions, such as supply chain management solutions and inventory and service parts 
logistics, through which we provide the service of integrating a complex set of tasks and components into a single capability. For these 
arrangements, the majority of which are conducted by our FedEx Logistics, Inc. (“FedEx Logistics”) operating segment, the entire 
contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. For these performance obligations, we typically have a right to consideration 
from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customers of our performance completed to date, and as 
such we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice the customer. 
FEDEX CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
- 83 -Contract Modification
Contracts are often modified to account for changes in the rates we charge our customers or to add additional distinct services. We 
consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new enforceable rights and obligations or alters the 
existing arrangement. Contract modifications that add distinct goods or services are treated as separate contracts. Contract 
modifications that do not add distinct goods or services typically change the price of existing services. These contract modifications 
are accounted for prospectively as the remaining performance obligations are distinct.
Variable Consideration
Certain contracts contain customer incentives, guaranteed service refunds, and other provisions that can either increase or decrease the 
transaction price. These incentives are generally awarded based upon achieving certain performance metrics. We estimate variable 
consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts of revenue, which may be 
reduced by incentives or other contract provisions, in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of 
cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our 
estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an 
assessment of anticipated customer spending and all information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. 
Principal vs. Agent Considerations
Transportation services are provided with the use of employees and independent businesses that contract with FedEx. GAAP requires 
us to evaluate whether our businesses themselves promise to transfer services to the customer (as the principal) or to arrange for 
services to be provided by another party (as the agent) using a control model. Based on our evaluation of the control model, we 
determined that FedEx is the principal to the transaction for most of these services and revenue is recognized on a gross basis based on 
the transfer of control to the customer. Costs associated with independent businesses providing transportation services are recognized 
as incurred and included in the caption “Purchased transportation” in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 
Our contract logistics, global trade services, and certain transportation businesses engage in certain transactions wherein they act as 
agents. Revenue from these transactions is recorded on a net basis. Net revenue includes billings to customers less third-party charges, 
including transportation or handling costs, fees, commissions, and taxes and duties.
Contract Assets and Liabilities
Contract assets include billed and unbilled amounts resulting from in-transit shipments, as we have an unconditional right to payment 
only once all performance obligations have been completed (e.g., packages have been delivered). Contract assets are generally 
classified as current, and the full balance is converted each quarter based on the short-term nature of the transactions. Our contract 
liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in excess of revenue. The full balance of deferred revenue is converted each 
quarter based on the short-term nature of the transactions. 
Gross contract assets related to in-transit shipments totaled $686 million and $861 million at May 31, 2023 and May 31, 2022, 
respectively. Contract assets net of deferred unearned revenue were $484 million and $623 million at May 31, 2023 and May 31, 
2022, respectively. Contract assets are included within current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Contract 
liabilities related to advance payments from customers were $19 million and $8 million at May 31, 2023 and May 31, 2022, 
respectively. Contract liabilities are included within current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Payment Terms
Certain of our revenue-producing transactions are subject to taxes and duties, such as sales tax, assessed by governmental authorities. 
We present these revenues net of tax. Under the typical payment terms of our customer contracts, the customer pays at periodic 
intervals (e.g., every 15 days, 30 days, 45 days, etc.) for shipments included on invoices received. It is not customary business practice 
to extend payment terms past 90 days, and as such, we do not have a practice of including a significant financing component within 
our revenue contracts with customers.
Disaggregation of Revenue
See Note 14 for disclosure of disaggregated revenue for the periods ended May 31. This presentation is consistent with how we 
organize our segments internally for making operating decisions and measuring performance.
FEDEX CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
- 84 -CREDIT RISK.  We routinely grant credit to many of our customers for transportation and business services without collateral. The 
risk of credit loss in our trade receivables is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process, short collection terms, and sales 
to a large number of customers, as well as the low revenue per transaction for most of our services. Allowances for potential credit 
losses are determined based on historical experience and the impact of current economic conditions. Historically, credit losses have 
been within management’s expectations. 
ADVERTISING. Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred and are classified in other operating expenses. Advertising 
and promotion expenses were $435 million in 2023, $470 million in 2022, and $428 million in 2021. 
CASH EQUIVALENTS.  Cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term, interest-bearing instruments with 
maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and is stated at cost, which approximates market value. 
SPARE PARTS, SUPPLIES, AND FUEL. Spare parts (principally aircraft-related) are reported at weighted-average cost. Allowances 
for obsolescence are provided for spare parts currently identified as excess or obsolete as well as expected to be on hand at the date the 
aircraft are retired from service. These allowances are provided over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines. The 
majority of our supplies and fuel are reported at weighted-average cost. 
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT . Expenditures for major additions, improvements, and flight equipment modifications are capitalized 
when such costs are determined to extend the useful life of the asset or are part of the cost of acquiring the asset. Expenditures for 
equipment overhaul costs of engines or airframes prior to their operational use are capitalized as part of the cost of such assets as they 
are costs required to ready the asset for its intended use. Maintenance and repairs costs are charged to expense as incurred, except for 
certain aircraft engine maintenance costs incurred under third-party service agreements. These agreements result in costs being 
expensed based on cycles or hours flown and are subject to annual escalation. These service contracts transfer risk to third-party 
service providers and generally fix the amount we pay for maintenance to the service provider as a rate per cycle or flight hour, in 
exchange for maintenance and repairs under a predefined maintenance program. We capitalize certain direct internal and external 
costs associated with the development of internal-use software, including implementation of cloud computing service arrangements. 
Gains and losses on sales of property used in operations are classified within operating expenses and historically have been nominal. 
For financial reporting purposes, we record depreciation and amortization of property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the 
asset’s service life or related lease term, if shorter. For income tax purposes, depreciation is computed using accelerated methods when 
applicable. 
The depreciable lives and net book value of our property and equipment are as follows (dollars in millions): 
 
Net Book Value at May 31,
Range 2023 2022
Wide-body aircraft and related equipment 15 to 30 years $ 16,973 $ 15,949
Narrow-body and feeder aircraft and related equipment 5 to 30 years 2,038 2,163
Package handling and ground support equipment 3 to 15 years 7,562 6,447
Information technology 3 to 7 years 1,859 1,907
Vehicles and trailers 3 to 15 years 3,996 4,004
Facilities and other 1 to 33 years 8,270 7,621
 
Substantially all property and equipment have no material residual values. The majority of aircraft costs are depreciated on a straight-
line basis over 15 to 30 years. We periodically evaluate the estimated service lives and residual values used to depreciate our property 
and equipment.   
Depreciation and amortization expense, excluding gains and losses on sales of property and equipment used in operations, was $4.2 
billion in 2023, $4.0 billion in 2022, and $3.8 billion in 2021. Depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of assets 
under finance leases. 
CAPITALIZED INTEREST . Interest on funds used to finance the acquisition and modification of aircraft, including purchase deposits, 
construction of certain facilities, and development of certain software up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use, is 
capitalized and included in the cost of the asset if the asset is actively under construction. Capitalized interest was $77 million in 2023, 
$62 million in 2022, and $68 million in 2021.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
- 85 -IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying 
value of an asset may not be recoverable. For assets that are to be held and used, an impairment is recognized when the estimated 
undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets is less than their carrying value. If impairment exists, an 
adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value, and a loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying value and fair 
value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or internal and external appraisals, as 
applicable. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value. 
We operate integrated transportation networks so cash flows for most of our operating assets to be held and used are assessed at a 
network level, not at an individual asset level, for our analysis of impairment. 
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related 
engines, four Boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines, to align 
with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to 
match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 
million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. All of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in 
revenue service. 
In the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and 
adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels. Temporarily idled assets are classified 
as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are 
assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis. The criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently 
removed from service (and, as a result, is potentially impaired) include, but are not limited to, our global economic outlook and the 
impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons; the 
introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service 
expansion activities. At May 31, 2023, we had 11 aircraft temporarily idled. These aircraft have been idled for an average of five 
months and are expected to return to revenue service.
GOODWILL. Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net 
assets of businesses acquired. Several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefits from synergies of 
the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our 
evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of 
a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, we proceed to test goodwill for 
impairment, including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value 
for our reporting units is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant considerations and 
management’s assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and expected capital expenditures. Fair value 
determinations may include both internal and third-party valuations. Unless circumstances otherwise dictate, we perform our annual 
impairment testing in the fourth quarter. See Note 4 for additional information.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS . Intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, technology assets, and trademarks acquired in 
business combinations. Intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from 1 to 15 years, either on a straight-line basis or on a 
basis consistent with the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized. See Note 4 for additional information. 
PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS.  Our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are 
measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management’s assumptions for discount rate, investment returns on plan assets, salary 
increases, expected retirement, mortality, employee turnover, and future increases in healthcare costs. We determine the discount rate 
(which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) could be effectively settled as of the measurement 
date) with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or 
better) with cash flows that are designed to match our expected benefit payments in future years. We use the fair value of plan assets 
to calculate the expected return on assets (“EROA”) for interim and segment reporting purposes. Our EROA is a judgmental estimate 
which is reviewed on an annual basis and revised as appropriate. 
The accounting guidance related to employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans requires 
recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of these plans. We use “mark-to-market” (or “MTM”) accounting and 
immediately recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial gains or losses in our results annually in the fourth quarter 
each year. The annual MTM adjustment is recognized at the corporate level and does not impact segment results. The remaining 
components of pension and postretirement healthcare expense, primarily service and interest costs and the EROA, are recorded on a 
quarterly basis. Only service cost is recognized in segment level operating results.
FEDEX CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
- 86 -INCOME TAXES.  Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and 
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. The liability method is used to account for income taxes, which 
requires deferred taxes to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid. 
Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets 
arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net 
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the 
adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating 
earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates to make this determination and, 
thus, there is a risk that these estimates will have to be revised as new information is received. To the extent we do not consider it 
more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. We believe we will generate 
sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance 
sheets that are not subject to valuation allowances. We record the taxes for global intangible low-taxed income as a period cost.
We recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for 
recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be 
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and 
measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently 
difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate 
these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are 
based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under 
audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an 
increase to the related provision. 
We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense, and if applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of 
income tax expense. The income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date 
are presented as current liabilities. The noncurrent portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties are recorded 
in the caption “Other liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS.  We are self-insured for costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, vehicle accidents, 
property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. Accruals are primarily 
based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims, which includes incurred-but-not-reported claims. Current workers’ compensation 
claims, vehicle and general liability, and long-term disability are included in accrued expenses. We self-insure up to certain limits that 
vary by operating company and type of risk. Claims costs are recognized on a gross basis and a receivable is recorded for amounts 
covered by third-party insurance. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk 
tolerance and premium expense.
We are also self-insured for certain short-term employee healthcare claims which are included within other accrued expenses. 
LEASES.  We lease certain facilities, aircraft, equipment, and vehicles under operating and finance leases. A determination of whether 
a contract contains a lease is made at the inception of the arrangement. Our leased facilities include national, regional, and 
metropolitan sorting facilities; retail facilities; and administrative buildings. 
Our leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease. We reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the 
economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options, and how they align with our operating strategy. Therefore, 
substantially all the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the 
measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the options to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement. 
Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized in the right-to-use asset and lease liability on the 
consolidated balance sheets.
The lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease 
payments not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which we would borrow, on a collateralized 
basis, over the term of a lease in the applicable currency environment. The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not 
determinable in transactions where we are the lessee. 
FEDEX CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
- 87 -For real estate leases, we account for lease components and non-lease components (such as common area maintenance) as a single 
lease component. Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume and index-based rate increases, as well 
as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease 
costs. Certain leases contain fixed lease payments for items such as real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and insurance. These 
fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use asset and lease liability. See Note 7 for 
additional information.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. Our risk management strategy includes the select use of derivative instruments to reduce 
the effects of volatility in foreign currency exchange exposure on operating results and cash flows. In accordance with our risk 
management policies, we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All derivative instruments are 
recognized in the financial statements at fair value, regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them. 
When we become a party to a derivative instrument and intend to apply hedge accounting, we formally document the hedge 
relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge, which includes designating the instrument for financial 
reporting purposes as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. 
If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument included in the 
assessment of hedge effectiveness is recorded in other comprehensive income. For net investment hedges, the entire change in the fair 
value is recorded in other comprehensive income. Any portion of a change in the fair value of a derivative that is considered to be 
ineffective, along with the change in fair value of any derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship, is immediately recognized 
in the income statement. We do not have any derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge for any period presented. As of May 31, 
2023, we designated €151 million of debt as a net investment hedge to reduce the volatility of the U.S. dollar value of a portion of our 
net investment in a euro-denominated consolidated subsidiary. As of May 31, 2023, the hedge remains effective. 
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  Translation gains and losses of foreign operations that use local currencies as the functional 
currency are accumulated and reported, net of applicable deferred income taxes, as a component of Accumulated Other 
Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) within common stockholders’ investment. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange 
rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency are included in the caption “Other, net” in the 
accompanying consolidated statements of income and were immaterial for each period presented. 
EMPLOYEES UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ARRANGEMENTS.  The pilots at FedEx Express, who are a small number of its 
total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (“ALPA”) and are employed under a collective 
bargaining agreement that took effect on November 2, 2015. The agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for a 
successor agreement began in May 2021, and in November 2022 the National Mediation Board began actively mediating the 
negotiations. In May 2023, FedEx Express reached a tentative successor agreement with ALPA. The tentative agreement was 
approved by ALPA’s FedEx Express Master Executive Council in June 2023 and is being presented to FedEx Express’s pilots for 
ratification during the first quarter of 2024. The ongoing ratification process has no effect on our operations. Once ratified, we expect 
to amend our pension plan offered to FedEx Express pilots resulting in a remeasurement of our pension benefit obligation. 
EQUITY INVESTMENT. Equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant 
influence are accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, and are classified as “Other 
assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated 
statements of income. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Our 
assessment includes a review of available recent operating results and trends, recent acquisitions and/or dispositions of the investee 
securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value. 
Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets and 
measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of income.
As of May 31, 2023, such investments were not material to our financial position or results of operations.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  The accounting guidance related to share-based payments requires recognition of compensation 
expense for stock-based awards using a fair value method. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value 
of stock options. The value of restricted stock awards is based on the stock price of the award on the grant date. We record stock-based 
compensation expense in the “Salaries and employee benefits” caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. We 
issue new shares or treasury shares from stock repurchases to cover employee stock option exercises and restricted stock grants.

- 88 -TREASURY SHARES. In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $5 billion of FedEx 
common stock. As part of the repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a bank in 
October 2022 to repurchase an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common stock. 
During 2023, 9.2 million shares were repurchased under the ASR agreement. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of 
the ASR agreement was determined based on a discount to the volume-weighted average price of our stock during the term of the 
transaction. The repurchased shares were accounted for as a reduction to common stockholders’ investment in the accompanying 
consolidated balance sheets and resulted in a reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common 
shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. 
In 2023, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of FedEx common stock at an average price of $163.39 per share for a total of $1.5 billion. 
In 2022, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of FedEx common stock at an average price of $253.85 per share for a total of $2.2 billion. 
As of May 31, 2023, approximately $2.6 billion remained available to use for repurchases under the program. 
Shares under the program may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing 
and volume of repurchases are at the discretion of management, based on the capital needs of the business, the market price of FedEx 
common stock, and general market conditions. No time limits were set for the completion of the program, and the program may be 
suspended or discontinued at any time.
DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE.  On April 5, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 
$1.26 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on July 3, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 
12, 2023. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend 
payment amount on an annual basis. There are no material restrictions on our ability to declare dividends, nor are there any material 
restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.
BUSINESS OPTIMIZATION AND REALIGNMENT COSTS . In the second quarter of 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a 
comprehensive program to improve the company’s long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to 
drive efficiency among our transportation segments and lower our overhead and support costs. We plan to consolidate our sortation 
facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-and-delivery routes, and optimize our enterprise linehaul network by moving beyond discrete 
collaboration to an end-to-end optimized network through Network 2.0.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced “one FedEx”, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, 
FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a 
unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight will continue to provide LTL freight 
transportation services as a stand-alone and separate company under Federal Express Corporation. The organizational redesign will be 
implemented in phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation 
program to improve long-term profitability, including Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx 
picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada. 
We have announced the implementation of Network 2.0 in more than 20 markets, including the phased transition of all FedEx Ground 
operations and personnel in Canada to FedEx Express beginning in April 2024. Under Network 2.0, FedEx will continue to utilize 
both FedEx employees and contracted service providers. 
We incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $273 million ($209 million, net of tax, or $0.81 per diluted 
share) in 2023. These costs were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in 
Russia. These business optimization costs are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express.
In 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan 
affected approximately 5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 
2023. We incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, 
net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs are related to certain 
employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 2023 and approximately $225 
million in 2022. The pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million through 2023.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
- 89 -USE OF ESTIMATES . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent 
liabilities. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other 
information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the 
accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas 
where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated 
include: self-insurance accruals; retirement plan obligations; long-term incentive accruals; tax liabilities; loss contingencies; litigation 
claims; impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including goodwill) that rely on projections of future cash flows; and purchase 
price allocations.
NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE 
New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly affect our reported results and the comparability of our financial 
statements. We believe the following new accounting guidance is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.
New Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, 
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848). In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 to temporarily ease the potential burden in 
accounting for reference rate reform. The standards provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States to existing contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate 
reform. The standards apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) 
or another reference rate to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The standards were effective upon issuance and can 
generally be applied through December 31, 2024. While there has been no material effect to our financial condition, results of 
operations, or cash flows from reference rate reform as of May 31, 2023, we continue to monitor our contracts and transactions for 
potential application of these ASUs. 
In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), which requires annual disclosures that 
increase the transparency of transactions involving government grants, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for 
those transactions, and (3) the effect of those transactions on an entity’s financial statements. These changes were effective June 1, 
2022. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities 
Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, which clarifies the guidance of measuring the fair value of equity securities subject to 
contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of the equity securities. Our historical accounting is consistent with these clarifications. 
We early adopted this standard effective September 1, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our consolidated 
financial statements and related disclosures.
In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier 
Finance Program Obligations, which requires a buyer in a supplier finance program (e.g., reverse factoring) to disclose sufficient 
information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program’s nature, activity during the period, 
changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The standard does not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial 
statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. We adopted this standard effective June 1, 2023 (fiscal 
2024). This standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
NOTE 3: CREDIT LOSSES
We are exposed to credit losses primarily through our trade receivables. We assess ability to pay for certain customers by conducting a 
credit review, which considers the customer’s established credit rating and our assessment of creditworthiness. We determine the 
allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable using a combination of specific reserves for accounts that are deemed to exhibit 
credit loss indicators and general reserves that are determined using loss rates based on historical write-offs by geography and recent 
forecast information, including underlying economic expectations. We update our estimate of credit loss reserves quarterly, 
considering recent write-offs, collections information, and underlying economic expectations. 
Credit losses were $696 million in 2023, $403 million in 2022, and $577 million in 2021. Our allowance for credit losses was $472 
million as of May 31, 2023 and $340 million at May 31, 2022.

(1)Primarily currency translation adjustments and purchase price allocation-related adjustments.  
In connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded an impairment 
charge of $36 million for all of the goodwill attributable to our FedEx Dataworks, Inc. (“FedEx Dataworks”) reporting unit. The key 
factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 2023, including base 
business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of 
acquisition. Based on these factors, our outlook for the business changed in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Our other reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight. We evaluated 
these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded 
their carrying values as of the end of 2023 and 2022; therefore, we do not believe that any of these reporting units were impaired as of 
the balance sheet dates.

recognized an $11 million asset impairment charge related to customer relationships from the ShopRunner acquisition.

- 92 -Interest on our U.S. dollar fixed-rate notes is paid semi-annually. Interest on our euro fixed-rate notes is paid annually. The weighted-
average interest rate on long-term debt was 3.5% as of May 31, 2023. Long-term debt, including current maturities and exclusive of 
finance leases, had estimated fair values of $17.5 billion at May 31, 2023 and $18.8 billion at May 31, 2022. The estimated fair values 
were determined based on quoted market prices and the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities. The fair value 
of our long-term debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. This classification is defined as a fair value determined 
using market-based inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the liability, either directly or indirectly. 
We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that allows us to sell, in one or 
more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows pass-through trusts formed by 
FedEx Express to sell, in one or more future offerings, pass-through certificates.
FedEx Express has issued $970 million of Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2020-1AA (the “Certificates”) with a fixed interest rate of 
1.875% due in February 2034 utilizing pass-through trusts. The Certificates are secured by 19 Boeing aircraft with a net book value of 
$1.7 billion at May 31, 2023. The payment obligations of FedEx Express in respect of the Certificates are fully and unconditionally 
guaranteed by FedEx. FedEx Express is using the proceeds from the issuance for general corporate purposes.

We have a $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (the “Five-Year Credit Agreement”) and a $1.5 billion three-year credit agreement 
(the “Three-Year Credit Agreement” and together with the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”). The Five-Year 
Credit Agreement expires in March 2026 and includes a $250 million letter of credit sublimit. The Three-Year Credit Agreement 
expires in March 2025. The Credit Agreements are available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs. As of May 31, 2023, 
no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Agreements, no commercial paper was outstanding, and $250 million of the letter of 
credit sublimit was unused under the Five-Year Credit Agreement. Outstanding commercial paper reduces the amount available to 
borrow under the Credit Agreements.
Our Credit Agreements contain a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated earnings (excluding 
noncash retirement plans MTM adjustments, noncash pension service costs, and noncash asset impairment charges) before interest, 
taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”) of not more than 3.5 to 1.0, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal 
quarter on a rolling four-quarters basis. The ratio of our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.08 to 1.0 at May 31, 2023. 
The financial covenant discussed above is the only significant restrictive covenant in the Credit Agreements. The Credit Agreements 
contain other customary covenants that do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially restrict the conduct of our business. We are 
in compliance with the financial covenant and all other covenants in the Credit Agreements and do not expect the covenants to affect 
our operations, including our liquidity or expected funding needs. If we failed to comply with the financial covenant or any other 
covenants in the Credit Agreements, our access to financing could become limited.

of insurance, none of our lease agreements include material financial covenants or limitations.
As of May 31, 2023, FedEx has entered into additional leases which have not yet commenced and are therefore not part of the right-
of-use asset and liability. These leases are generally for build-to-suit facilities and have undiscounted future payments of 
approximately $1.8 billion and will commence when FedEx gains beneficial access to the leased asset. Commencement dates are 
expected to be from 2024 to 2026.
FedEx Express makes payments under certain leveraged operating leases that are sufficient to pay principal and interest on certain 
pass-through certificates. The pass-through certificates are not direct obligations of, or guaranteed by, FedEx or FedEx Express. 
We are the lessee under certain leases covering a portion of our leased aircraft in which the lessors are trusts established specifically to 
purchase, finance, and lease these aircraft to us. These leasing entities are variable interest entities. We are not the primary beneficiary 
of the leasing entities, as the lease terms are at market at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-
price purchase option, or similar feature that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate in increases in the 
value of the aircraft. Therefore, we are not required to consolidate any of these entities as the primary beneficiary. Our maximum 
exposure under these leases is included in the summary of future minimum lease payments.

Stock-based compensation expense $ 182 $ 190 $ 200
We have two types of equity-based compensation: stock options and restricted stock. 
STOCK OPTIONS . Under the provisions of our incentive stock plan, key employees and non-employee directors may be granted 
options to purchase shares of our common stock at a price not less than its fair market value on the date of grant. Vesting requirements 
are determined at the discretion of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors. Option-vesting 
periods range from one to four years, with the majority of our options vesting ratably over four years. Compensation expense 
associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. 
RESTRICTED STOCK. Under the terms of our incentive stock plan, restricted shares of our common stock are awarded to key 
employees. All restrictions on the shares expire ratably over a four-year period. Shares are valued at the market price on the date of 
award. The terms of our restricted stock provide for continued vesting subsequent to the employee’s retirement. Compensation 
expense associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the requisite service period or the stated 
vesting period. 
ASSUMPTIONS . The key assumptions for the Black-Scholes valuation method include the expected life of the option, stock price 
volatility, a risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. The following table includes the weighted-average Black-Scholes value per 
share of our stock option grants, the intrinsic value of options exercised (in millions), and the key weighted-average assumptions used

The expected life represents an estimate of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding, and we examine actual stock 
option exercises to determine the expected life of the options. Options granted have a maximum term of 10 years. Expected volatilities 
are based on the actual changes in the market value of our stock and are calculated using daily market value changes from the date of 
grant over a past period equal to the expected life of the options. The risk-free interest rate is the U.S. Treasury Strip rate posted at the 
date of grant having a term equal to the expected life of the option. The expected dividend yield is the annual rate of dividends per 
share over the exercise price of the option.

The 2023 tax provision was negatively impacted by an expense of $46 million related to a write-down and valuation allowance on 
certain foreign tax credit carryforwards due to operational changes which impacted the determination of the realizability of the 
deferred tax asset. The 2023 tax provision was also negatively impacted by lower earnings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
The 2022 tax provision includes a benefit of $142 million related to revisions of prior year tax estimates for actual tax return results. 
The 2022 tax provision was also favorably impacted by changes in our corporate legal entity structure. 
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act allowed a five-year carryback period for tax losses generated in 2019 
through 2021. The 2021 tax provision includes a benefit of $279 million from an increase in our 2020 tax loss carried back to 2015, 
when the U.S. federal income tax rate was 35%. The increase in our 2020 tax loss was attributable to accelerated depreciation 
deductions and voluntary contributions to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans (“U.S. Pension Plans”). The 2021 tax 
provision also includes a benefit of $66 million from a tax rate increase in the Netherlands applied to our deferred tax asset balances 
and was negatively impacted by an increase in uncertain tax positions for matters in multiple jurisdictions.
We regularly assess the need for cash in the U.S., as well as in our foreign subsidiaries, and will occasionally repatriate back to the 
U.S. excess earnings above working capital needs that can be repatriated with an immaterial tax cost. We assert all other earnings, 
both historical and current in our foreign subsidiaries, are permanently reinvested and therefore no deferred taxes or withholding taxes 
have been provided, including deferred taxes on any additional outside basis difference (e.g., stock basis differences attributable to 
acquisition or other permanent differences). Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to any 
remaining undistributed foreign earnings and additional outside basis differences is not practicable.

(1)Noncurrent deferred tax assets are included in the line item “Other Assets” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
We have approximately $3.4 billion of net operating loss carryovers in various foreign jurisdictions, $1.5 billion of state operating loss 
carryovers, and $153 million of U.S. federal operating loss carryovers. The valuation allowances primarily represent amounts reserved 
for operating loss carryforwards, which expire over varying periods starting in 2024. Therefore, we establish valuation allowances if it 
is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable 
income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The increase in 
the valuation allowance balance during 2023 includes $37 million related to foreign net operating losses and $22 million for foreign 
tax credit carryforwards. See Note 1 for more information on our policy for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets and 
valuation allowances. 
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various U.S. state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by 
the Internal Revenue Service for the 2016 through 2019 tax years. It is reasonably possible that certain income tax return proceedings 
will be completed during the next 12 months and could result in a change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits. However, we 
believe we have recorded adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, for any adjustments expected to occur.
During 2021, we filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee challenging the validity of a tax regulation 
related to the one-time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, which was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
(“TCJA”). Our lawsuit seeks to have the court declare this regulation invalid and order the refund of overpayments of U.S. federal 
income taxes for 2018 and 2019 attributable to the denial of foreign tax credits under the regulation. We have recorded a cumulative 
benefit of $223 million through 2023 attributable to our interpretation of the TCJA and the Internal Revenue Code. On March 31, 
2023, the District Court ruled that the regulation is invalid and contradicts the plain terms of the tax code. We continue to work 
towards obtaining a final judgment for the applicable refund amounts due to the regulation being invalid. Once the District Court 
enters a final judgment, the U.S. government could file an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. If we are 
ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, we may be required to reverse the benefit previously recorded.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended May 31 is as follows (in 
millions): 
 
2023 2022 2021
Balance at beginning of year $ 169 $ 192 $ 129

Our liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions include $211 million at May 31, 2023 and $167 million at May 31, 2022 associated 
with positions that, if favorably resolved, would provide a benefit to our income tax expense. We classify interest related to income 
tax liabilities as interest expense and, if applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The balance of 
accrued interest and penalties was $54 million on May 31, 2023 and $55 million on May 31, 2022. Our consolidated statements of 
income for 2021 include $20 million of interest expense associated with our uncertain tax positions while interest and penalty expense 
for 2023 and 2022 are immaterial.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
- 100 -It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax positions. Changes may result from the conclusion of 
ongoing audits, appeals, or litigation in state, local, federal, and foreign tax jurisdictions, or from the resolution of various proceedings 
between U.S. and foreign tax authorities. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect to certain of our 
unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease within the next 12 months. However, estimates of the amounts or ranges for 
individual matters where a material change is reasonably possible cannot be made. We believe we have recorded adequate amounts of 
tax reserves, including interest and penalties, for any adjustments that may occur. 
NOTE 13: RETIREMENT PLANS 
We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension 
plans, defined contribution plans, and postretirement healthcare plans.
The accounting guidance related to postretirement benefits requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined 
benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and the recognition in either expense or AOCI of unrecognized gains or losses 
and prior service costs or credits. We use MTM accounting for the recognition of our actuarial gains and losses related to our defined 
benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans as described in Note 1. The funded status is measured as the difference between 
the fair value of the plan’s assets and the PBO of the plan.

Net of all fees and expenses, the actual rate of return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets was -2.70%, which was lower than our expected 
rate of return of 6.50%. Negative portfolio returns derived due to losses in both equities and our fixed-income assets due to market 
volatility and rising interest rates. The weighted-average discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plans 
increased from 4.21% at May 31, 2022 to 5.17% at May 31, 2023. The demographic experience in 2023 reflects an update to our 
short-term cash balance interest crediting assumption.
2022
Net of all fees and expenses, the actual rate of return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets was -10.8%, which was lower than our expected 
rate of return of 6.50%. Negative portfolio returns derived due to losses in both equities and our fixed-income assets due to market 
volatility and rising interest rates. The weighted-average discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plans 
increased from 3.11% at May 31, 2021 to 4.21% at May 31, 2022. The demographic experience in 2022 reflects an update to our 
mortality assumption and a current year actuarial loss due to unfavorable experience compared to various demographic assumptions.

- 101 -2021
Net of all fees and expenses, the actual rate of return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets was 12.90%, which was higher than our expected 
return of 6.75%. Positive portfolio returns derived from our return-seeking assets were partially offset by losses from our fixed-income 
assets due to rising long-term interest rates. The weighted-average discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plans 
increased from 3.05% at May 31, 2020 to 3.11% at May 31, 2021. The demographic experience in 2021 reflects an update to our 
mortality and retirement rate assumptions and a current-year actuarial loss due to unfavorable experience compared to various 
demographic assumptions. 
PENSION PLANS . Our largest pension plan covers certain U.S. employees age 21 and over, with at least one year of service. Pension 
benefits for most employees are accrued under a cash balance formula we call the Portable Pension Account (“PPA”). Under the PPA, 
the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay, age and years 
of credited service, and interest on the notional account balance. The PPA benefit is payable as a lump sum or an annuity at retirement 
at the election of the employee. The plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on a U.S. Treasury index. Prior to 2009, 
certain employees earned benefits using a traditional pension formula (based on average earnings and years of service). Benefits under 
this formula were capped on May 31, 2008 for most employees. 
We also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. employee groups and other pension plans 
covering certain of our international employees. The international defined benefit pension plans provide benefits primarily based on 
earnings and years of service and are funded in compliance with local laws and practices. The majority of our international obligations 
are for defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.  
In 2020, we announced the closing of our U.S.-based defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees hired on or after 
January 1, 2020. We introduced an all-401(k) plan retirement benefit structure for eligible employees with a higher company match of 
up to 8% across all U.S.-based operating companies in 2022. During calendar 2021, current eligible employees under the PPA pension 
formula were given a one-time option to continue to be eligible for pension compensation credits under the existing PPA formula and  
remain in the existing 401(k) plan with its company match of up to 3.5%, or to cease receiving compensation credits under the PPA 
and move to the new 401(k) plan with the higher match of up to 8%. Changes to the new 401(k) plan structure became effective 
January 1, 2022. See Note 1 for additional information on expected amendments to our pension plan offered to FedEx Express pilots.
POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS . Certain of our subsidiaries offer medical, dental, and vision coverage to eligible U.S. 
retirees and their eligible dependents and a small number of international employees. U.S. employees covered by the principal plan 
become eligible for these benefits at age 55 and older, if they have permanent, continuous service of at least 10 years after attainment 
of age 45 if hired prior to January 1, 1988, or at least 20 years after attainment of age 35 if hired on or after January 1, 1988. 
Postretirement healthcare benefits are capped at 150% of the 1993 per capita projected employer cost, which has been reached under 
most plans, so these benefits are not subject to future inflation.
Effective January 1, 2018, certain of our U.S. postretirement healthcare benefits were converted to a lump-sum benefit in a notional 
retiree health reimbursement account (HRA) for eligible participants. The HRA is available to reimburse a participant for qualifying 
healthcare premium costs and limits the company liability to the HRA account balance. The amount of the credit is based on age at 
January 1, 2018 or upon age at retirement thereafter. In connection with this change, retiree health coverage was closed to most new 
employees hired on or after January 1, 2018.
PENSION PLAN ASSUMPTIONS.  The accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plans includes numerous assumptions, 
such as: discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future salary increases; employee turnover; mortality; 
and retirement ages.

Our U.S. Pension Plan assets are invested primarily in publicly tradable securities, and our pension plans hold only a minimal 
investment in FedEx common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third-party pension fund investment managers. As part of our 
strategy to manage pension costs and funded status volatility, we follow a liability-driven investment strategy to better align plan 
assets with liabilities. 
Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter, which we review on an annual 
basis and revise as appropriate. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption: 
• the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets; 
• the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected compound geometric return we 
can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over time, net of all fees and expenses; and 
• the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we 
could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed funds. 
For consolidated pension expense, we assumed a 6.50% expected long-term rate of return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets in 2023 and 
2022 and 6.75% in 2021. The historical annual return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets, calculated on a compound geometric basis, was 
5.70%, net of all fees and expenses, for the 15-year period ended May 31, 2023. 
The investment strategy for our U.S. Pension Plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of public equities, fixed-income, and alternative 
investments to earn a long-term investment return that meets our pension plan obligations. Our largest asset classes are Corporate 
Fixed Income Securities and Government Fixed Income Securities (which are largely benchmarked against the Bloomberg Barclays 
Long Government, Bloomberg Barclays Long Corporate, or the Bloomberg Barclays 20+ STRIPS indices), and U.S. and non-U.S. 
Equities (which are mainly benchmarked to the S&P 500 Index and MSCI indices). Accordingly, we do not have any significant 
concentrations of risk. Active management strategies are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment returns in excess of 
market indices. Our investment strategy also includes the limited use of derivative financial instruments on a discretionary basis to 
improve investment returns and manage portfolio risk.

- 103 -The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value: 
•Cash and cash equivalents . Level 1 investments include cash, cash equivalents, and foreign currency valued using exchange 
rates. Level 2 investments include short-term investment funds, which are collective funds priced at a constant value by the 
administrator of the funds. 
•Domestic, international, and global equities . Level 1 investments are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the 
major market on which the individual securities are traded. 
•Fixed income . We determine the fair value of Level 2 corporate bonds, U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, and other 
fixed-income securities by using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. 
•Alternative Investments . The valuation of Level 3 investments requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted 
market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the long-term nature of such assets. Investments in private equity, debt, real 
estate, hedge funds, and other private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information 
received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. These estimates incorporate factors such as contributions and 
distributions, market transactions, market comparables, and performance multiples.

NOTE 14: BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND DISAGGREGATED REVENUE 
FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Services, constitute our 
reportable segments. Our reportable segments include the following businesses: 
FedEx Express Segment FedEx Express (express transportation, small-package ground delivery, and freight 
transportation)
FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. (time-critical transportation)
FedEx Ground Segment FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery)
FedEx Freight Segment FedEx Freight (LTL freight transportation)
FedEx Services Segment FedEx Services (sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer 
service, technical support, billing and collection services, and back-office functions)
In the fourth quarter of 2023, FedEx announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, 
FedEx Services, and other FedEx operating companies into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a 
unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the respected FedEx brand. The organizational redesign will be implemented in 
phases with full implementation expected in June 2024. During the implementation process in fiscal 2024, each of our current 
reportable segments will continue to have discrete financial information that will be regularly reviewed when evaluating performance 
and making resource allocation decisions, and aligns with our management reporting structure and our internal financial reporting. In 
the first quarter of fiscal 2025 when the consolidation plan has been completed, we expect to begin reporting a resegmented structure 
that will align with an updated management reporting structure and how management will evaluate performance and make resource 
allocation decisions under one FedEx.
Effective June 1, 2020, the results of FedEx Cross Border Holdings, Inc. (“FedEx Cross Border”) are included in the FedEx Express 
segment prospectively as the impact to prior periods was not material. This change was made to reflect our internal management 
reporting structure. FedEx Cross Border was subsequently merged into FedEx Express in 2022. 
References to our transportation segments include, collectively, the FedEx Express segment, the FedEx Ground segment, and the 
FedEx Freight segment.
FedEx Services Segment 
The FedEx Services segment operates combined sales, marketing, administrative, and information-technology functions in shared 
services operations for U.S. customers of our major business units and certain back-office support to our operating segments which 
allows us to obtain synergies from the combination of these functions. For the international regions of FedEx Express, some of these 
functions are performed on a regional basis and reported by FedEx Express in their natural expense line items. 
FEDEX CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
- 108 -The FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our operating segments, and we allocate all of the net operating 
costs of the FedEx Services segment to reflect the full cost of operating our businesses in the results of those segments. We review and 
evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of FedEx Services segment 
allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance is evaluated based on the effect of its total allocated net operating costs on 
our operating segments.
Operating expenses for each of our transportation segments include the allocations from the FedEx Services segment to the respective 
transportation segments. These allocations include charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating 
companies. The allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as relative revenue or estimated services provided. We 
believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. Our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, 
as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses. 
Other Intersegment Transactions
Corporate and other includes corporate headquarters costs for executive officers and certain legal and finance functions, including 
certain other costs and credits not attributed to our core business, as well as certain costs associated with developing our “innovate 
digitally” strategic pillar through our FedEx Dataworks operating segment. FedEx Dataworks is focused on creating solutions to 
transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members. ShopRunner, Inc. was merged into FedEx 
Dataworks during 2023.
Also included in Corporate and other is the FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. (“FedEx Office”) operating segment, which provides 
an array of document and business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses, and the 
FedEx Logistics operating segment, which provides integrated supply chain management solutions, specialty transportation, customs 
brokerage, and global ocean and air freight forwarding. 
The results of Corporate, other, and eliminations are not allocated to the other business segments.
Certain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx companies outside their reportable 
segment in order to optimize our resources. Billings for such services are based on negotiated rates, which we believe approximate fair 
value, and are reflected as revenue of the billing segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such 
intersegment revenue and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results and are not separately identified in the following 
segment information because the amounts are not material.

NOTE 16: GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS 
In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily the lease, sale, or purchase of real estate, operating assets, or services in the 
ordinary course of business and in connection with business sales and acquisitions, we may provide routine guarantees or 
indemnifications (e.g., environmental, fuel, tax, and intellectual property infringement), the terms of which range in duration, and 
often they are not limited and have no specified maximum obligation. The overall maximum potential amount of the obligation under 
such guarantees and indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not been required to make significant 
payments under our guarantee or indemnification obligations and no material amounts have been recognized in our financial 
statements for the underlying fair value of these obligations. As a result of the TNT Express acquisition, we previously assumed a 
guarantee related to the demerger of TNT Express and PostNL N.V., which occurred in 2011, for pension benefits earned prior to the 
date of the demerger. The guarantee was released in 2023.

The amounts reflected in the table above for purchase commitments represent noncancelable agreements to purchase goods or

purposes and are not included in the table above.
We have several aircraft modernization programs under way that are supported by the purchase of Boeing 777 Freighter (“B777F”) 
and Boeing 767-300 Freighter (“B767F”) aircraft. These aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types 
previously utilized, and these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older 
aircraft. Our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify 
existing purchase agreements.

NOTE 18: CONTINGENCIES
Service Provider Lawsuits . FedEx Ground is defending lawsuits in which it is alleged that FedEx Ground should be treated as a joint 
employer of drivers employed by service providers engaged by FedEx Ground. These cases are in varying stages of litigation, and we 
are not currently able to estimate an amount or range of potential loss in all of these matters. However, we do not expect to incur, 
individually or in the aggregate, a material loss in these matters. Nevertheless, adverse determinations in these matters could, among 
other things, entitle service providers’ drivers to certain wage payments from the service providers and FedEx Ground and result in 
employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for FedEx Ground. We continue to believe that FedEx Ground is not an 
employer or joint employer of the drivers of these independent businesses.
FedEx Services Employment Lawsuit . In May 2021, FedEx Services was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District 
Court for the Southern District of Texas related to the termination of a former FedEx Services employee. The complaint alleged race 
discrimination and retaliation for complaints of discrimination under Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964. After trial, in October 2022, the jury found in favor of FedEx Services on the race discrimination claims but 
awarded the plaintiff compensatory damages of $1.16 million for emotional distress and punitive damages of $365 million for the 
retaliation claims. The court entered final judgment in the amount of the jury verdict. FedEx Services has appealed the verdict to the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. FedEx Services argues on appeal that FedEx Services is entitled to judgment as a matter of 
law on the retaliation claims, plaintiff’s claims were not timely filed, punitive damages are not available as a matter of law and, if 
allowed, must be reduced to no greater than a single-digit multiple of the award for compensatory damages based on the United States 
Supreme Court’s ruling in State Farm v. Campbell , and the compensatory damages award must be reduced to conform with the 
evidence and the Fifth Circuit’s maximum recovery rule. FedEx Services argues in the alternative that a new trial should be granted.
 
FedEx believes ultimate compensatory and punitive damages and pre- and post-judgment interest up to $75 million will be covered by 
insurance, subject to a retention of $5 million. An immaterial loss accrual below the retention has been recorded in FedEx’s 
consolidated financial statements.
FedEx Ground Negligence Lawsuit.  In December 2022, FedEx Ground was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in Texas state 
court related to the alleged kidnapping and first-degree murder of a minor by a driver employed by a service provider engaged by 
FedEx Ground. The complaint alleges compensatory and punitive damages against FedEx Ground for negligent and gross negligent 
hiring and retention, as well as negligent entrustment. The service provider and driver are also named as defendants in the lawsuit. An 
immaterial loss accrual has been recorded in FedEx’s consolidated financial statements. It is reasonably possible that an additional 
material loss could be incurred. Given the early stage of the litigation, we cannot estimate the amount or range of such additional loss, 
if any.
Other Matters . FedEx and its subsidiaries are subject to other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including 
certain lawsuits containing various class-action allegations of wage-and-hour violations in which plaintiffs claim, among other things, 
that they were forced to work “off the clock,” were not paid overtime, or were not provided work breaks or other benefits, as well as 
other lawsuits containing allegations that FedEx and its subsidiaries are responsible for third-party losses related to vehicle accidents 
that could exceed our insurance coverage for such losses. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to 
these other actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

- 113 -Environmental Matters . SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state, or 
local environmental provisions if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated 
threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, FedEx uses a threshold of $1 million or more for purposes of determining whether 
disclosure of any such proceedings is required. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters required to be disclosed 
for this period.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
The management of FedEx, with the participation of our principal executive and financial officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of 
our disclosure controls and procedures in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s 
rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to FedEx management as appropriate to 
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive and financial officers have 
concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31, 2023 (the end of the period covered by this 
Annual Report). 
Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Management’s report on our internal control over financial reporting and the report of Ernst & Young LLP with respect to our internal 
control over financial reporting are presented in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
During the third quarter of 2023, we successfully completed a significant migration to an enterprise resource planning, cloud-based 
financial system for a number of our domestic operating companies, building on the phased migration plan which began with our 
international operating companies in prior years. We implemented new internal controls in conjunction with the migration. During our 
fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2023, no change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting, including the new controls 
described above, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
We continue to monitor and assess the effects of remote work on our internal controls to minimize the impact on the design and 
operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
Additional migrations to the cloud-based financial system will occur through 2024 and will result in further changes to our internal 
controls over financial reporting. As changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal 
control over financial reporting.
