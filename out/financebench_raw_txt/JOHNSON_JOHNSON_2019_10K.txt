CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and Johnson & Johnson's other publicly available documents contain "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson
and its subsidiaries (the "Company") also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to
historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements
may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with,
among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and
dispositions; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to
uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if
underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition
could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to
rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition
•Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s
continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory
approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and
technologies in the United States and other important markets;
•The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing biosimilars and generics and resulting revenue and market share
losses;
•Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar
or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges,
potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;
•Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process
obsolescence;
•Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies;
•Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and
•Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the
Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.
Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity
•Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action
on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation
expense and share price impact;
•Impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product
liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;
•Impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability,
personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings;
•Increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which
carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business;
•Failure to meet compliance obligations in the McNEIL-PPC, Inc. Consent Decree or any other compliance agreements with governments or
government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions;
•Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new
products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of health care products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, health care products
and services; environmental protection and sourcing of raw materials;
•Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in relevant markets including,
requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union's Medical Devices Regulation;
•Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, including changes related to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States, the
Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing in Switzerland, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to
additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and
•Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives and Healthcare Market Trends
•Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward health care cost containment, including the continued consolidation among health care providers and
other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of health care
expenses, significant new entrants to the health care markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs
and price increases;
•Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of health care products and services due to economic hardship
and budgetary constraints;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development
collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to
competitive pressures;
•The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not
be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; and
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to
realize than expected.
Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally
•Impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and
resulting margins;
•Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade
restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation;
•The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental
controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems;
•Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company's products and services, cause disruptions
in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and
integrity of the Company's products and operations; and
•The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world including social and economic disruptions and
instability of financial and other markets.
Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations
•Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally through third party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or
involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory
action;
•Interruptions and breaches of the Company's information technology systems or those of the Company's vendors which, could result in reputational,
competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action;
•Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that
may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products; and
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the global supply chain, including the
Company's transaction with Jabil, may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from
applicable regulatory authorities. Disruptions associated with the announced global supply chain actions may adversely affect supply and sourcing of
materials used in the Company's products.
Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks that
could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should
understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete
statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made
from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments.
PART I
Item 1. BUSINESS
General
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 132,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and
development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, with operating
companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being.
Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the
resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical
and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating
companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business
segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located.
Segments of Business
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this
item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Report; and Note 18 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Consumer
The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products focused on personal healthcare used in the beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical,
baby care, oral care, women’s health and wound care markets. Major brands in Beauty include the AVEENO®; CLEAN & CLEAR®; DR. CI:LABO®;
NEUTROGENA® and OGX® product lines. Over-the-counter medicines include the broad family of TYLENOL® acetaminophen products; SUDAFED®

 1
                                
maintenance treatment of Bipolar 1 Disorder in adults; ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer

treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI® (selexipag), the only approved oral, selective IP receptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin
pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain
active lifecycle development programs.
Medical Devices
The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and
neurovascular) and eye health fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by
physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. They include orthopaedic products; general surgery, biosurgical, endomechanical and
energy products; electrophysiology products to treat cardiovascular disease; and vision products such as disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products
related to cataract and laser refractive surgery.
Geographic Areas
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 132,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and
development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the
world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of Business – Consumer,” “–
 Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with
the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.
Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment
and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system
uncertainties.
Raw Materials
Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the
temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.
Patents
The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are
licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing
processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries
face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key
pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the
Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Sales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA® (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 7.8% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal
2019. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company.
                
 2
                                
There is one set of granted patents related specifically to STELARA®. This set of patents is owned by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. These patents are in force in the U.S. and many countries outside the U.S. In the U.S., the latest projected expiration date
for patents in this set is 2023 due to patent term extension and adjustment. In most of Europe, the latest projected expiration date for patents in this set is
2024 due to a Supplementary Protection Certificate (patent term extension). In most other countries, the latest projected expiration date is 2021.
In addition to competing in the immunology market with STELARA®, the Company is currently marketing SIMPONI® (golimumab) and
SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab), next generation immunology products. Patents related to these products are in force and the latest projected U.S.
expiration date is 2024 due to patent term extension and adjustment. The Company also markets REMICADE® (infliximab) in the immunology market
which is the Company’s 2nd largest product. Patents on this product have expired and the Food and Drug Administration approved the first infliximab
biosimilar for sale in the U.S. in 2016, and a number of such products have been launched since then. For a more extensive description of legal matters
regarding the patents related to REMICADE®, see Note 21 “Legal Proceedings - Intellectual Property - Pharmaceutical - REMICADE® Related Cases” of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Trademarks
The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by
all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company
considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.
Seasonality
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.
Competition
In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines
without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the
development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative
products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of
its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of
customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Environment
The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations
comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements did not change
during the past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.
Regulation
The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the
general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. We are subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental
regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the drug, device
and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing,
advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) continues to
result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the
expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the
new privacy regulations in Europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation.
The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product
withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate
product recalls.
                
 3
                                
The FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are
not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the
U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products,
refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health
professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or
criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain
conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the US Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory
action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or
approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different
countries in which we conduct business.
The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and
legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and
programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. There is increased
focus on interactions between healthcare companies and health care providers and various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of
financial relationships between companies and health care providers. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is
being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally.
U.S. government agencies continue efforts to repeal and modify provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) which
passed in 2010. For example, federal legislation repealed the ACA’s individual mandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employer-sponsored
healthcare plans; CMS began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by Medicaid expansion plans; certain federal subsidies to
insurers have ended; and certain short-term insurance plans not offering the full array of ACA benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of
these changes are being challenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains uncertain. The U.S. government also continues to propose and
implement changes to the Medicare Part D benefit including the size of manufacturer discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of the benefit.
This changing federal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various
provisions of federal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry.
In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and
state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing
regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from Brexit, that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of
materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
The Company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. In
addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below.
Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all
potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition
could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.
Global sales in the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing
pricing pressures.
Sales of the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government
healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting
downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of
Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in further pricing
pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU
and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or
reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.
The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage.
In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as
patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or
consumer protection laws. The most significant of these proceedings are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in
particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs or may be determined to be class actions and may
involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For
example, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS® Baby Powder,
and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible
to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or
judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other
defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. Furthermore, as a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the
Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance.
Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and
cause reputational damage.
Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence,
can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or its counterpart in other countries),
private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to
brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government
investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation
costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.
Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in
statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in
the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any
time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.
                
 6
                                
In fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) which became effective on January 1, 2020. As of
December 29, 2019, certain cantons where the Company operates have not yet enacted portions of the tax reform as stipulated in the Swiss Federal law.
These enactments and future possible guidance from the applicable taxing authorities may have a material impact on the Company’s operating results.
See Note 8 on income taxes for additional information.
The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In
connection with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, companies are required to
disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries.
The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax
authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.
The Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the Company’s businesses.
The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, determined by patent offices, courts and lawmakers in various
countries, relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the
Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights.
The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the U.S. and other important markets or
that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.
Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences,
oppositions and other proceedings. These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the
Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the
competitive position and sales of the products in question.
The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the
Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic
versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the
Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the FDA. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010,
which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created
mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The inter partes review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created
under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the Company’s subsidiaries.
In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent
infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a
very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 21, “Legal
Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s
earnings.
The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company’s businesses compete with
companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived
product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to
acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in
significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly
products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could
negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the
related product development.
                
 7
                                
For the Company’s pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors
gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for
a biological product. For the Company’s medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are
especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make
the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s consumer businesses face intense competition from
other branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products,
this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.
Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an
adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.
The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the
evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue
losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products
introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2019 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to
develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval,
and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.
The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and
licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology
products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development
programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care providers’
future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property
protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company’s products from
competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the
marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or
uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and
efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.
The Company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government
investigations, legal actions and penalties.
Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action, by national, state and local
government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which they operate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices
(cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and
penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing
and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Increased scrutiny of
health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and
prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare
programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current
investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings” under Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
The Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally.
The Company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial, economic and political risks, including
those listed below.
Foreign Currency Exchange: In fiscal 2019, approximately 49% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 23% in Europe,
7% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 19% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency
exchange rates on its cash flows,
                
 8
                                
unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant
favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.
Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks: The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high
inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary,
as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost
reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In
addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively
impact the Company’s operating results.
Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products: The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or
other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the
Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal
under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced
imports has grown significantly.
Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with
respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded
companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the
purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore
involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human
pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s
interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the
FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and
penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal
proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health
care programs.
Other Legal, Social and Political Risks. Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include:
•protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements;
•compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture
or sell its products in the relevant market;
•diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;
•potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets; and
•disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, social upheavals or pandemics.
Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and reputation.
The Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The
Company's subsidiaries operate 97 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past,
and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions
can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires),
natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest and terrorist attacks. Such delays and
difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs
associated with addressing the shortage.
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third party manufacturer could result in
delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of
their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality
                
 9
                                
and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that
these third party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an
adverse effect on our business.
Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include, reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and
quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing
agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or
inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience
power outages, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency,
the Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need to seek and source other
qualified third party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely.
Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business.
Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a
growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our
rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic
version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured-often in unregulated,
unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites-as well as the lack of regulation of their contents.
The industry's failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in
our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from
their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.
An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation
To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their
vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data
that may be subject to legal protection. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the
security and availability of these IT systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company
continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the
Company’s third party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact
to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with
the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in
reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity
insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident, however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial losses.

In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, the Company maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the
world. Research facilities are also discussed in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition of this
Report.
The Company's subsidiaries generally seek to own, rather than lease, their manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in non-U.S.
locations, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company also engages contract manufacturers.
The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition.
McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the
FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the "Consent Decree"). Following FDA inspections McNEIL-PPC
received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, and commercial
production has restarted in 2015.
Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three
facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times
until at least 2020.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Organization and Business Segments
Description of the Company and Business Segments
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 132,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development,
manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the
primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad
range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are
marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six
therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices
segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health
fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals,
eye care professionals and clinics.
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the
resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business
segments.
In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all
product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the
improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as
protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for
the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Management’s Objectives
With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for
humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this
common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes.
The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products
and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2019 sales. In 2019, $11.4 billion was invested in
research and development and $5.8 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create
value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.
A critical driver of the Company’s success is the 132,200 diverse employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the
Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to
also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise, enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence.
This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering
value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.

In 2019, worldwide sales increased 0.6% to $82.1 billion as compared to an increase of 6.7% in 2018. These sales changes consisted of the following:

Volume 3.7 % 8.5 %
Price (0.9) (2.2)
Currency (2.2) 0.4 
Total 0.6 % 6.7 %
The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 1.7% in 2019 and a positive impact of 0.8% in
2018.
Sales by U.S. companies were $42.1 billion in 2019 and $41.9 billion in 2018. This represents increases of 0.5% in 2019 and 5.1% in 2018. Sales by
international companies were $40.0 billion in 2019 and $39.7 billion in 2018. This represents an increase of 0.7% in 2019 and 8.5% in 2018.
The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.0%, 3.9% and 0.2%, respectively. The ten-year
compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.9%, 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively.
In 2019, sales by companies in Europe experienced a sales decline of 1.5% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 3.8%
offset by a negative currency impact of 5.3%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) experienced a sales decline of 2.8% as
compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 5.7% offset by a negative currency impact of 8.5%. Sales by companies in the Asia-
Pacific, Africa region achieved growth of 4.9% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 6.9% partially offset by a negative currency
impact of 2.0%.

of the total consolidated revenues. In 2018, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately

impact of 2.7%. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.8 billion, an increase of 1.4%. International sales were $8.1 billion, a decrease of 0.4%, which

Total Consumer Sales  $ 13,898 13,853 0.3 %
 
The Beauty franchise sales of $4.6 billion increased 4.8% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by incremental sales from the
acquisition of Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd., (DR.CI:LABO) in Japan as well as market growth and share gains of NEUTROGENA® and AVEENO® products.
Growth was partially offset by the divestitures of RoC® and NIZORAL® in the fiscal year 2018.
The Over-the-Counter (OTC) franchise sales of $4.4 billion increased 2.5% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by incremental
sales from the acquisition of ZARBEES®. Additional contributors to the growth were TYLENOL®, Children's MOTRIN®, digestive health products and
anti-smoking aids.
The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of 9.9% compared to the prior year, primarily due to JOHNSON’s® competitive
pressures coupled with comparisons to prior year relaunch activities and the Baby Center divestiture.
The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.5 billion decreased 1.7% as compared to the prior year. Growth in LISTERINE® Mouthwash and Ready Tabs
outside the U.S. was offset by share declines and retailer destocking in the U.S. and the negative impact of currency.
The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.0 billion in 2019, a decrease of 6.0% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by
the negative impact of currency and weakness in liners partially offset by strength in napkins in Asia Pacific and Latin America.
The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven
by the divestiture of COMPEED® outside the U.S. and the negative impact of currency.

currency impact of 2.2%. U.S. sales were $23.9 billion, an increase of 2.5%. International sales were $18.3 billion, an increase of 5.0%, which included
10.1% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 5.1%. In 2019, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the Pharmaceutical segment
operational sales growth was negligible. Adjustments to previous reserve estimates, as compared to the prior year, positively impacted the Pharmaceutical
segment operational growth by approximately 1.3%, primarily in the Immunology and Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other therapeutic areas.

uptake of STELARA® (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease, and TREMFYA® (guselkumab) in Psoriasis, expanded indications of SIMPONI®/SIMPONI
ARIA® (golimumab), and the U.S. immunology market growth. Immunology was negatively impacted by lower sales of REMICADE® (infliximab) due to
increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition.
The patents for REMICADE® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been
introduced in certain markets outside the U.S., resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will
likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States. In the U.S., a biosimilar version of REMICADE® was
introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a
further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the
REMICADE® patents.
Infectious disease products sales were $3.4 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 3.3% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of
SYMTUZA® and the launch of JULUCA® (dolutegravir/rilpivirine) were partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA® and PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA®
(darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA® in certain countries outside the U.S.
Neuroscience products sales were $6.3 billion, representing an increase of 4.1% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of long-acting injectables
INVEGA TRINZA®/TREVICTA®(paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION® were partially offset by cannibalization of
RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone).
Oncology products achieved sales of $10.7 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth
were strong sales of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) with continued market growth and share gain, IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) due to increased patient
uptake globally. Additionally, sales from the launch of ERLEADA™ (apalutamide) contributed to the growth. Growth was negatively impacted from a
decline in U.S. sales of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) driven by generic competition partially offset by increased sales outside the U.S. Lower sales of
VELCADE® (bortezomib) were also due to generic competition.
Pulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $2.6 billion, representing an increase of 1.9% as compared to the prior year. Sales of OPSUMIT®
(macitentan) and UPTRAVI® (selexipag) were due to continued market growth and increased share gains while sales of TRACLEER® (bosentan) were
negatively impacted by generics and cannibalization from OPSUMIT®.
Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $5.2 billion, a decline of 10.7% as compared to the prior year. XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) sales
volume growth was offset by higher discounts and rebates. Lower sales of INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin) were due to share loss from
competitive pressure and a safety label update in the U.S. and lower sales of PROCRIT®/ EPREX® (epoetin alfa) were due to biosimilar competition.

The Surgery franchise sales were $9.5 billion in 2019, a decrease of 4.0% from 2018. Growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by
endocutter, biosurgery and energy products. The decline in General Surgery was primarily driven by the negative impact of currency partially offset by
growth of wound closure products. The decline in Specialty Surgery was primarily driven by the divestiture of the sterilization business (ASP) partially
offset by growth of aesthetic products.
The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.8 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.5%, including operational growth of 1.2% offset by a negative currency
impact of 1.7% as compared to the prior year. The growth in hips was driven by leadership position in the anterior approach, strong market demand for the
ACTIS® stem and the KINCISE™ surgical automated system. Knees grew outside the U.S. from new products coupled with continued global uptake of
ATTUNE® Revision, offset by a negative currency impact. Growth in trauma was due to strong market growth coupled with continued uptake of new
products. The decline in Spine & Other was primarily driven by base business declines in Spine partially offset by growth in Sports which was led by new
products, MONOVISC® in the U.S. and growth in Asia Pacific.
The Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.6 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.6% from 2018. Growth was primarily driven by the strength of daily
disposable lenses in the ACUVUE® OASYS contact lenses category. The Surgical operational growth was primarily driven by the strength of cataracts
outside the U.S. partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S.
The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $3.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 13.3% from 2018. Strong growth in the electrophysiology
business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth and with strong THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® SF Contact Force Sensing Catheter and
diagnostic catheter sales.

Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income
Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $17.3 billion and $18.0 billion for the fiscal years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a
percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 21.1% and 22.1%, in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses:  Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses
as a percent to sales were as follows:
% of Sales  2019  2018
Cost of products sold  33.6% 33.2
Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  0.4 (0.1)
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses  27.0% 27.6
Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  (0.6) (0.5)
In 2019, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.6% from 33.2% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily driven by the
negative impact of currency in the Pharmaceutical business as well as increased intangible asset amortization expense. Intangible asset amortization
expense of $4.5 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2019 as compared to $4.4 billion in 2018. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of
selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2019 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to favorable segment mix with a higher percentage of
sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business, planned prioritization and reduced brand marketing expense in the Consumer business partially offset by
increased selling and marketing investments in the Medical Devices business.
Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows:

Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering,
testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy
and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high
quality and innovative products. In 2019, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 5.4% compared to 2018 primarily driven by
increased investment in the Medical Devices business related to robotics and digital surgery platforms along with higher upfront and developmental
milestone payments, primarily from the argenx collaboration in the Pharmaceutical business.
Research facilities are located in the U.S., Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional R&D support in over 30 other countries.
In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the
remaining intangible asset value related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus
(RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was based on additional
information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the Company's decision to abandon the development of AL-8176. In the fiscal third
quarter of 2018, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 billion which included a partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the
development program of AL-8176 and an impairment charge of $0.3 billion for the discontinuation of the development project for an anti-thrombin
antibody associated with the 2015 acquisition of XO1 Limited.
Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down
of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains
and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty
income.
The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2019 was additional net expense of $1.1 billion primarily attributable to litigation expense
of $5.1 billion in 2019, primarily related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of $4.0 billion, as compared to litigation expense of $2.0
billion in 2018. This was partially offset by divestiture gains in 2019 of $2.2 billion of which $2.0 billion related to the divestiture of the ASP business. In
addition, the fiscal year 2019 included higher unrealized gains on securities of $0.7 billion, an equity step-up gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's
previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO, and lower restructuring related expense of $0.2 billion as compared to the same period a year ago.
Divestiture gains were approximately $1.2 billion in 2018 and included the LifeScan business, NIZORAL®, RoC® and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical
products. Additionally, 2018 included a reversal of a contingent liability of $0.2 billion.
Interest (Income) Expense: The fiscal year 2019 included net interest income as compared to an expense in the fiscal year 2018. This was primarily due to
the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements and certain cross currency swaps, and a lower average debt balance. Cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities totaled $19.3 billion at the end of 2019, and averaged $19.5 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities total of $19.7 billion and $19.0 billion average cash balance in 2018. The total debt balance at the end of 2019 was $27.7 billion with an average
debt balance of $29.1 billion as compared to $30.5 billion at the end of 2018 and an average debt balance of $32.5 billion. The decrease in debt was due to
the retirement of long-term debt.

Consumer Segment: In 2019, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 14.8%, versus 16.7% in 2018. The decrease in the
income before tax as a percent of sales in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to higher expenses for litigation of $0.1 billion, intangible
asset amortization of $0.1 billion and restructuring of $0.1 billion in the fiscal year 2019 as compared to the fiscal year 2018. This was partially offset by
planned prioritization and brand marketing expense reductions. The fiscal year 2019 included a gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously
held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO. Divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018 included a gain of $0.3 billion from the divestiture of NIZORAL®.
Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2019, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.9% versus 30.9% in 2018. The decrease in
the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to higher litigation expense of $4.3 billion, primarily due to the agreement in principle to
settle opioid litigation of $4.0 billion, increased spending in research and development, including a $0.3 billion upfront payment to argenx. This was
partially offset by $0.8 billion of higher unrealized gains on securities, a lower in-process research and development charge of $0.2 billion, and lower
Actelion acquisition and integration related costs as compared to the fiscal year 2018. In addition, the fiscal year 2018 included a contingent liability
reversal of $0.2 billion and higher divestiture gains of $0.2 billion.
Medical Devices Segment: In 2019, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 28.1% versus 16.3% in 2018. The increase
in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily attributable to higher divestiture gains in 2019. Divestiture gains in the fiscal 2019 included a
gain of $2.0 billion related to the ASP business. Divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018 included a gain of $0.5 billion related to LifeScan.
Additionally, the fiscal year 2019 included lower litigation expense of $1.3 billion, lower restructuring charges of $0.2 billion and lower intangible asset
amortization expense of $0.1 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2018. This was partially offset by increased investment in robotics and digital solutions.
Restructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to
enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its
product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of
strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its
network.  Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In
total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by
2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70%
of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.6 billion, which is included on the
following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.2 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of
products sold. Total project costs of approximately $0.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.
See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.
Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 12.7% in 2019 and 15.0% in 2018.
For discussion related to the fiscal 2019 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On September 28, 2018 the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF). On May 19, 2019 a public
referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the federal reform proposals. In the fiscal third quarter of 2019, the Swiss Federal Council enacted
TRAF which became effective on January 1, 2020. On February 9, 2020 a public referendum on the legislative change was held in the last remaining
canton where the Company has significant operations. The legislation was approved by the voters and formal enactment is expected in the fiscal first half
of 2020. The Company has not yet elected the transitional provision in this canton. However, the net financial benefit is estimated to be between $0.2
billion and $0.5 billion in the fiscal first half of 2020. The Company does not believe that TRAF will have a material impact to the Company’s ongoing
consolidated effective tax rate beginning in fiscal year 2020.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity & Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents were $17.3 billion at the end of 2019 as compared to $18.1 billion at the end of 2018. The primary sources and uses of cash that
contributed to the $0.8 billion decrease were approximately $23.4 billion of cash generated from operating activities. This was offset by $6.2 billion net
cash used by investing activities and $18.0 billion net cash used by financing activities. In addition, the Company had $2.0 billion in marketable securities
at the end of 2019 and $1.6 billion at the end of 2018. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities.
Cash flow from operations of $23.4 billion was the result of $15.1 billion of net earnings and $9.1 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments
for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, assets write-downs (primarily related to the Alios IPR&D asset), and favorable increases in
accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities of $5.5 billion. This was reduced by $1.6 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable,
inventories, other current and non-current assets. as well as non-cash expenses and other adjustments of $2.5 billion for the increase in the deferred tax
provision and a net gain on sale of assets/businesses of $2.2 billion (primarily related to the ASP divestiture).
Investing activities use of $6.2 billion of cash was primarily used for acquisitions of $5.8 billion primarily related to the acquisitions of Auris Health,
Inc. and DR. CI:LABO, additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.5 billion and $0.5 billion from the net purchases of investments. Investing
activities also included a source of $3.3 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses, primarily the ASP divestiture, and proceeds from credit
support agreements of $0.3 billion.
Financing activities use of $18.0 billion of cash was primarily used for dividends to shareholders of $9.9 billion, the repurchase of common stock of
$6.7 billion and the net retirement of short and long term debt of $2.9 billion. Financing activities also included sources of $1.5 billion from proceeds of
stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, and other financing activities.
On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to
purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. Shares acquired are available for general corporate purposes. The Company financed
the share repurchase program through available cash. As of September 29, 2019, $5.0 billion was repurchased under the program and the program was
completed.
As of December 29, 2019, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of
December 29, 2019, the net debt position was $8.4 billion as compared to the prior year of $10.8 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due
to retirement of debt. The debt balance at the end of 2019 was $27.7 billion as compared to $30.5 billion in 2018. In 2019, the Company continued to have
access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a
significantly reduced cost. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from
existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs,
including the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation to be potentially paid over the next two to three years. As discussed in Note 8 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the
tax years 2010-2012. The Company currently expects completion of this audit and settlement of the related tax liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. As of
December 29, 2019, the Company has classified unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of approximately $0.9 billion as a current liability in the
“Accrued taxes on Income” line in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This is the amount expected to be paid over the next 12 months with respect to the IRS
audit. Subsequent to December 29, 2019, the Company made a payment for approximately $0.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the estimated 2010-
2012 tax audit liability in anticipation of the final settlement later in fiscal 2020. The completion of this tax audit may result in additional adjustments to the
Company’s unrecognized tax benefit liability that may have a material impact on the Company’s future operating results or cash flows in the period that the
audit is substantially completed.
The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.
The Company filed a shelf registration on February 27, 2017, which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis and will be updated as required.
For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Financing and Market Risk
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into
forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions
primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of
the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2019 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $271 million.
Conversely, a
                
 27
                                
10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2019 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by
$331 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore,
would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.
The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by
entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial
instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1,043 million. In either scenario, at
maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on
future anticipated cash flows.
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into
contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is
no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. During the fiscal second quarter of
2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on
respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements.
The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of
fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if
interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the
unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $7 million.
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2019, the Company secured a new 364-day
Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 10, 2020. Interest charged on borrowings
under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), or other applicable
market rate as allowed under the terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.
Total borrowings at the end of 2019 and 2018 were $27.7 billion and $30.5 billion, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was due to the retirement
of debt in 2019. In 2019, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $8.4 billion compared to net debt of $10.8 billion in 2018. Total
debt represented 31.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2019 and 33.8% of total capital in 2018. Shareholders’ equity per share at the
end of 2019 was $22.59 compared to $22.44 at year-end 2018.
A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for the recently enacted tax legislation, leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other
significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s
contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 29, 2019 (see Notes 7, 8, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for

Other Information
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires
that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures.
Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates
are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue
recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for
pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are
satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90
days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable
consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Accounting Standards Update related to
revenue which was adopted in 2018.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and
projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through
the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to
dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product
recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in
accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales
returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices
segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns
reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2019 and 2018.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales.
Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on
historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period
and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of
revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers.
For all years presented, profit-share payments were approximately 2.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.
In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative
partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part
of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
disclosures on collaborations.
Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect
on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a
material financial statement impact.

(2) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between
U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The
Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the
earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the
Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts.
The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.8 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and
at current currency exchange rates.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability
claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where
applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals
in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable
and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the
minimum amount is accrued.
                
 31
                                
See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows
in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change
over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.
Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination
indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,
mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Company’s results of operations.
Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their
services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a
combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the
service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield.
For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and
earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the
award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total
shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements
not yet adopted as of December 29, 2019.
Economic and Market Factors
The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have
expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products
responsibly. For the period 2009 - 2019, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health
care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to
monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way
companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly
inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In
the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic
price increases.
In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to
as “Brexit” and on January 31, 2020, the U.K. formally exited the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what the ultimate financial,
trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which
may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in
regulations.  However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position or operating results. As of December 29, 2019, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of
both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues, respectively.
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies
in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2019 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately
$390 million and net income by approximately $120 million.
Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory
tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that
particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted.  This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the
statutory tax rate
                
 32
                                
may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. For
discussion on Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (Swiss Tax Reform) see Provision for Taxes on Income in Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment
and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing
prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global
economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.
The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug
Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents,
seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering
those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar
versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those
products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could
launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further
information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Legal Proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial
and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 29, 2019, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation
matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and
adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other
litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or
range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future
events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and
judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or
indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties;
there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; or there are
numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is
determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal
proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.
However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.
See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.
Common Stock
The Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 12, 2020, there were 135,953 record
holders of Common Stock of the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded
figures.
Description of the Company and Business Segments
The Company has approximately 132,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of
products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to
human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad
range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are
marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six
therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices
segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health
fields, which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care
professionals and clinics.
New Accounting Standards
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
ASU 2016-02: Leases
The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of fiscal year 2019, on a prospective basis. This update requires the recognition of lease assets and
lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all lease obligations and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update requires the
recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for arrangements that are classified as operating leases. The Company’s operating leases resulted
in the recognition of additional assets and the corresponding liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet, however it did not have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.
The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of
identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to
make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment,
Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the
lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of
lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are
included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.
The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements,
exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.
For additional disclosures see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2018-02: Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
This update allows a Company to elect to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Job Act enacted in December 2017 from
accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The Company has elected not to reclassify the income tax effects of this standard and
therefore this standard will not impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.
                
 41
                                
ASU 2018-16: Derivatives and Hedging (Topic ASC 815)
This update adds the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as an eligible benchmark interest rate
permitted in the application of hedge accounting. The guidance was effective for the Company as of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018, due to the previous
adoption of ASU 2017-12. The impact of the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures. The standard may have an impact in the future as the market for SOFR derivatives develops over time and if SOFR is used to
hedge the Company’s financial instruments.
Accounting Standards adopted in the fiscal 2018 with a cumulative effect to the 2018 opening balance of Retained Earnings
The following table summarizes the cumulative effect adjustments made to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of the new
accounting standards mentioned below:
(Dollars in Millions)Cumulative Effect Adjustment Increase
(Decrease) to Retained Earnings
ASU 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers $ (47)
ASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments 232 
ASU 2016-16 - Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers (439)
Total $ (254)
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Not Adopted as of December 29, 2019
ASU 2018-18: Collaborative Arrangements
This update clarifies the interaction between ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The update
clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a
customer. In addition, the update precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue if the
counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2018-18 should be applied retrospectively to the date of initial application of ASC 606 and early adoption is
permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
This update introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which will require an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments
and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity will be required to
recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. This
update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is
permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Cash Equivalents
The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly
liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy
of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in
government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs).
RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their value. The
Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that
the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that
collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date
of purchase are classified as marketable securities.
                
 42
                                
Investments
Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments
classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as
long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates
such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through
earnings, as required. 
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:
Building and building equipment 20 - 30 years
Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years
Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with
developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which
generally range from 3 to 8 years.
The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or
economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is
determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not
available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs
with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain
rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as
a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and
projected market conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's
pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.0 billion and $5.8 billion
as of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily
through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to
dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product
recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in
accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales
returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices
segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns
reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales.
Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on
historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period
and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of
revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in
                
 43
                                
sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were approximately 2.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.
See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.
Shipping and Handling
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are included in selling,
marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods
presented.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The
Company completed its annual impairment test for 2019 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth
quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying
project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the
intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by
economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill.
Financial Instruments
As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1
having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for
undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the
Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness
of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial
Instruments.
Product Liability
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted
periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when
those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not
record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that
exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments
made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments
made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts
capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize
drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are
exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by
one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and
royalty or profit
                
 44
                                
share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative
partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract
development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:
Nature/Type of Collaboration  Statement of Earnings Presentation
Third-party sale of product & profit share payments received  Sales to customers
Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory
approval)*  Cost of products sold
Royalties received from collaborative partner  Other income (expense), net
Upfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-
regulatory approval)  Research and development expense
Research and development payments to collaborative partner  Research and development expense
Research and development payments received from collaborative partner Reduction of Research and development expense
* Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life.
For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense.
The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO®, co-developed with
Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA®, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.
Separately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX®, licensed from Genmab A/S.
 
Advertising
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising
expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $2.2 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion in 2019, 2018
and 2017, respectively.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP
accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax
regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of the global
intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related
to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). In fiscal
2018, the Company elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary
differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.
The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The
Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the
earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the
Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts.
The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.8 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and
at current currency exchange rates.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.

Net Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common
stock using the treasury stock method.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives,
product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability
valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and
can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the
minimum amount is accrued.
Annual Closing Date
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year
consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in
2015, and will be the case again in 2020.
Reclassification
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

6.Fair Value Measurements
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange
rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency
interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.
Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are
designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment
hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These
forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings,
thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.
 
The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent
features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on
respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of December 29, 2019, the total amount of cash collateral held by the Company under the credit
support agreements (CSA) amounted to $255 million net, primarily related to net investment hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-
party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with
commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair
value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of December 29, 2019, the Company had notional
amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, and cross currency interest rate swaps of $45.3 billion, and $20.1 billion respectively. As of
December 30, 2018, the Company
                
 49
                                
had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $41.1 billion, $7.3
billion, and $0.5 billion respectively.
All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current
earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge
transaction.
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly
effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these
contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the
hedged transaction.
Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to
interest expense in the period in which they occur. The effect of which are immaterial for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30,
2018. Gains and losses on net investment hedge are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive
income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the
Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer
expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued.
The Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the
Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by
changes in exchange rates.
As of December 29, 2019, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $295 million after-
tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the
amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected
to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate
contracts, net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are
ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

For the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 for equity investments without readily determinable market values, $57 million and
$54 million respectively, of the changes in fair value reflected in net income were the result of impairments. There were $19 million and $67 million
respectively, of changes in fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices.
Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs
used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all
future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot
foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be
realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or
financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The
Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose
values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant
judgment or estimations.
The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.
Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.
The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018

Fair value of the long-term debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted broker prices and significant other observable
inputs.
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2019, the Company secured a new 364-day
Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 10, 2020. Interest charged on borrowings
under the credit line agreements is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) or other applicable
market rate as allowed under the terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material.
Throughout 2019, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current
portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $1.2 billion at the end of 2019, of which $1.1 billion is the current portion of the long-term debt, and
the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries.
Throughout 2018, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current
portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $2.8 billion at the end of 2018, of which $2.6 billion is the current portion of the long term debt, and
the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries.

(1) For all periods presented the Company has subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under various tax incentives. International operations reflects the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with
statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate. The
2017 amount also includes tax cost related to the revaluation of deferred tax balances related to the change in the Belgian statutory tax rate increasing the tax provision by approximately 3.4%.
(2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code.

The 2019 tax rate decreased by 2.3% compared to the fiscal year 2018 tax rate. In addition to the impact of Swiss tax reform discussed in more detail
below, the primary drivers of the net decrease were as follows:
•The Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, which
resulted in a reduction of certain withholding and local taxes that it had previously recognized as part of the provisional Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA) tax charge in the fiscal year 2017 and finalized in the fiscal year 2018. Following the completion of this restructuring and approval by the
applicable local authorities, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $0.6 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $0.2 billion for U.S.
foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $0.4 billion decreasing the annual effective tax rate by 2.2%. This benefit has been reflected as
“TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•The impact of the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation for $4 billion (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) which
reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5% and decreased the Company’s annual effective tax rate by approximately
2.1%.
•In December of fiscal year 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in the Company revising the amount
of foreign tax credits that were initially recorded in the fiscal year 2017 as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge. As a result, the Company
recorded an increased deferred tax asset related to these foreign tax credits of approximately $0.3 billion or 1.7% to the annual effective tax rate.
This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•The Company reassessed its uncertain tax positions related to the current IRS audit and increased its unrecognized tax benefit by $0.3 billion
liability which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.5% (see section on Unrecognized Tax Benefits for additional
information). As these positions were related to uncertain tax regarding international transfer pricing, this expense has been classified as
“International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. Subsequent to December 29, 2019, the Company received and
agreed to Notices of Proposed Adjustments (NOPAs) from the IRS. The Company believes it is adequately reserved for potential exposures.
•There were several one-time tax impacts that resulted in a cumulative net tax benefit to the 2018 annual effective tax rate of 1.2%. These items
included the LifeScan divestiture, the adjustment to the 2017 provisional TCJA tax charge and the acceleration of certain tax deductions as part of
the 2017 tax return.
•More income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2018.
On September 28, 2018 the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF). On May 19, 2019 a public
referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the federal reform proposals. In the fiscal third quarter of 2019, the Swiss Federal Council enacted
TRAF which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Federal transitional provisions
                
 57
                                
of TRAF allow companies, under certain conditions, to adjust their tax basis adjustments to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) which is used for tax depreciation
and amortization purposes resulting in a deduction over the transitional period. The subsequent adjustment to the Company’s asset tax basis will require
review and approval by the tax authorities.
TRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations for companies. The new cantonal tax
parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research and development tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF
are also expected to allow companies to elect either 1) tax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a
period not to exceed 5 years. The Company currently has operations located in various Swiss cantons and enactment may not be uniform in both the
substantive nature of the legislation and the timing of enactment.
The Company recorded a net tax expense of $0.1 billion which increased the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2019 by approximately 0.6%. This net tax
expense related to federal and certain cantonal enactments in the fiscal year 2019 consisting of the following provisions:
•approximately $0.6 billion tax expense relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and
cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred by December 29, 2019; this expense has been reflected as “International Operations” on the
Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•a $0.9 billion deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss subsidiaries’ assets; this
benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•approximately $450 million of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss
deferred tax assets and liabilities and the new deferred tax asset for the Federal step-up. this benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international
income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration issued authoritative guidance that required the Company to decrease the
estimated value of the Federal tax basis step-up by approximately $0.3 billion from the determination made in the fiscal third quarter of 2019. Further
authoritative guidance from the relevant Swiss tax authorities may be issued in the future and additional revisions may be required in the fiscal period that
they are issued.
The Company is currently assessing and applying for approval for the elective transition provisions in several cantons which includes discussions with
local tax authorities on the application of the new law. The Company has recorded an estimated impact of the transitional provisions based on the best
available information for cantons where enactment has occurred but the Company has not yet received a final tax ruling.
As of December 29, 2019, the one canton where the Company maintains significant operations has not yet enacted TRAF legislation and the amounts
recorded in the fiscal year 2019 do not include estimates for unenacted legislation. On February 9, 2020 a public referendum on the legislative change was
held in this canton and the legislation was approved by the voters; formal enactment is expected in the fiscal first half of 2020. The Company has not yet
elected the transitional provision in this canton. However, the net financial benefit is estimated to be between $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion in the fiscal first
half of 2020.
U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) (2018 and 2017)
In the fiscal year 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the TCJA. This law included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul
of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. This legislation
also eliminated or reduced certain corporate income tax deductions as well as introduced new provisions that taxed certain foreign income not previously
taxed by the United States. The TCJA also included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign
jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of
8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance
at the end of the fiscal year 2019 was approximately $8.2 billion, of which $7.7 billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes
payable” on the Company’s balance sheet. The balance of this account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next
12 months.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax cost of approximately $13.0 billion which consisted primarily of the following
components:
•a $10.1 billion charge on previously undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017
•a $4.5 billion deferred tax liability for foreign local and withholding taxes, offset by a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset for U.S. foreign tax credits,
for repatriation of substantially all those earnings
                
 58
                                
•a $0.6 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and the impact of the TCJA on unrecognized tax
benefits
•a $0.1 billion charge for U.S. state and local taxes on the repatriation of these foreign earnings
In the fiscal year 2018, the Company completed its full assessment and finalized the accounting for the impact of the TCJA. The Company recorded net
adjustments to the above components of the provisional charge of approximately $0.2 billion. These revisions were based on updated estimates and
additional analysis by management as well as applying interpretative guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury to the facts and circumstances
that existed as of the TCJA enactment date. This charge was primarily related to additional deferred tax liabilities for foreign local and withholding taxes
for the remaining balance of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 that were not provided for in the 2017 provisional charge.
The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on GILTI. GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed
return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In the fiscal year 2018, the Company elected to treat GILTI as a period expense under the deferred
method and recorded a deferred tax cost of approximately $1.4 billion in the fiscal year 2018 related to facts and circumstances that existed on the date of
TCJA enactment. See Note 1 for further information regarding income taxes accounting policies.
During 2018, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries which resulted in a reduction of certain foreign withholding
taxes that it had recognized as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Following the completion of this restructuring and as a
result of clarification by Swiss tax authorities regarding the applicability of withholding tax to repatriation of certain earnings, the Company reversed a
deferred tax liability of $2.8 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $0.9 billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $1.9 billion.
This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
The 2018 effective tax rate decreased by 77.6% compared to 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate was primarily driven by the approximately $13 billion
provisional tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the impact of a Belgian statutory tax rate change which increased the 2017 effective rate
by 3.4%. Additional drivers of the 2018 annual effective tax were:
•the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate including the effects of tax elections which resulted in the acceleration of certain deductions
into the 2017 tax return. The impact of these accelerated deductions decreased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.7%
•the impact of the adjustments to the 2017 provisional TCJA charge, including both Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 adjustments and the
internal restructuring, decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 1.9%
•GILTI tax which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.6%, which excludes the impact of the SAB 118 adjustment for the
adoption of the deferred method for GILTI
•tax benefits received from stock-based compensation during fiscal 2018 and 2017, reduced the effective tax rate by 1.5% and 2.0%, respectively
•in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed the divestiture of its LifeScan business (See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements), which increased the Company's annual effective tax rate by approximately 0.8%
•more income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2017

(1) In 2017, $347 million of this decrease is related to the TCJA.
The unrecognized tax benefits of $3.9 billion at December 29, 2019, if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The Company
conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the
United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012.
The Company currently expects completion of this audit and settlement of the related tax liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. As of the December 29, 2019,
the Company has classified unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of approximately $0.9 billion as a current liability on the “Accrued taxes on
Income” line of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This is the amount expected to be paid over the next 12 months with respect to the IRS audit. Subsequent
to December 29, 2019, the Company made a payment for approximately $0.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the estimated 2010-2012 tax audit
liability in anticipation of the final settlement later in fiscal 2020. The completion of this tax audit may result in additional adjustments to the Company’s
unrecognized tax benefit liability.
In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2006. The Company believes
it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States.
However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax
positions.
The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities, except as previously noted on
amounts related to the current United States IRS audit. Interest expense and penalties related to
                
 60
                                
unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $50 million, $53 million and $60
million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $559 million and $503 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Prepaid employee related obligations of $551 million and $475 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
10.Pensions and Other Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover
most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their
dependents.
Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant.
Retirement plan benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last three to five
years before retirement and the number of years of service. In 2014, the Company announced that the U.S. Defined Benefit Plan was amended to adopt a
new benefit formula, effective for employees hired on or after January 1, 2015. The benefits are calculated using a new formula based on employee
compensation over total years of service.
International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are
provided.
The Company does not typically fund retiree health care benefits in advance, but may do so at its discretion. The Company also has the right to modify
these plans in the future.
In 2019 and 2018 the Company used December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international
retirement and other benefit plans.
Net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2019, 2018 and 2017 include the following
components:

Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active
employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using
a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in
excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.
Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the
plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan
participants at the time of the plan amendment.
The following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions:

Rate of increase in compensation levels  4.01% 3.97 3.99 4.29 4.29 4.30
The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The
resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. The Company's methodology in determining service and interest cost uses
duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows.
The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment
portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset
class and the various asset class allocations by market.

The Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. International Plans are funded in
accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans.
For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that
are not funded.
In 2019, the Company contributed $489 million and $419 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively.
The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded
pension plans at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively:

Each pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall administration and investment of the pension plans. In
determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax
regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives
to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority
of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed,
with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds.
The Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2019 and 2018 and target allocations for 2020 are as follows:
  Percent of
Plan Assets  Target
Allocation
  2019  2018  2020
Worldwide Retirement Plans       
Equity securities  74% 71% 69%
Debt securities  26 29 31
Total plan assets  100% 100% 100%
Determination of Fair Value of Plan Assets
The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If
listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market
parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.
While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or
assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
Valuation Hierarchy
The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are
described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.
The Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares
outstanding.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.
•Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the
custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a
quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2.
•Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on
which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of
the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models,
quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an
active market, they are classified as Level 2.
•Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual
securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are
not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar
characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs.
•Equity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.
Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
•Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets in the Level 2 category
have a quoted market price.
                
 65
                                
•Insurance contracts — The instruments are issued by insurance companies. The fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying
investments held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer. The underlying investments are
government, asset-backed and fixed income securities. In general, insurance contracts are classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices nor
other observable inputs for pricing.
•Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by
the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are
classified as Level 2.

14.International Currency Translation
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international
subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative
rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority
of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical
rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly
inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.
A rollforward of the changes during 2019, 2018 and 2017 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13.
Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $267 million, $265 million and $216 million in 2019,
2018 and 2017, respectively.
15.Earnings Per Share
The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019,
December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017:
(In Millions Except Per Share Amounts)  2019  2018  2017
Basic net earnings per share  $ 5.72 5.70 0.48
Average shares outstanding — basic  2,645.1 2,681.5 2,692.0
Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans  136.3 139.0 139.7
Less: shares repurchased under treasury stock method  (97.8) (92.5) (87.3)
Convertible debt shares  0.7 0.7 0.9
Adjusted average shares outstanding — diluted  2,684.3 2,728.7 2,745.3
Diluted net earnings per share  $ 5.63 5.61 0.47
The diluted net earnings per share calculation included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that is offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $1
million after-tax for 2019, 2018 and 2017.
The diluted net earnings per share calculation for 2019 excluded an insignificant number of shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of
these options was greater than the average market value of the Company’s stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for 2018 and 2017 included
all shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of all options was less than the average market value of the Company's stock.
 
16.Lease Commitments
The Company primarily has operating leases for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing equipment. Leases have remaining lease
terms ranging from 1 year to 55 years, some of which could include options to extend the leases when they are reasonably certain.
The operating lease costs were approximately $307 million, $332 million and $372 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash paid for amounts
included in the measurement of lease liabilities in 2019 were $308 million. Commitments under finance leases are not significant. Other supplemental
information related to these leases are as follows:

17.Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements
At December 29, 2019, the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-
Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares
granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to
650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to
April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 315 million at the end of 2019.
The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $977 million, $978 million and $962 million for 2019, 2018 and
2017, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $227 million, $192 million and
$275 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $823 million, $827 million and $798 million for 2019,
2018 and 2017, respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.71 years, 1.73 years and 1.76 years for 2019, 2018, and
2017, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.
The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished throughout the year for the number of
shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.

Stock Options
Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years. All options are granted at the
average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted
in the following table. For 2019, 2018 and 2017 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and
a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is
used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The average fair value of options granted was $17.80, $17.98 and $13.38, in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the
weighted average assumptions of:
 2019  2018  2017
Risk-free rate 2.56% 2.77% 2.25%
Expected volatility 16.27% 15.77% 15.30%
Expected life (in years) 7.0 7.0 7.0
Expected dividend yield 2.80% 2.70% 2.90%

Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units
The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years. The Company also grants performance
share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three-year performance period. Whether any performance
share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a
three-year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted
operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-year period will vary,
based only on actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company
modified the restricted share units that were scheduled to vest between January 1, 2018 and March 15, 2018. This modification guaranteed a minimum
aggregate value, below the market value of the total expected payout amount, for all awards expected to vest during this period. The amount that was
committed was not material to the Company’s overall financial position.
A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of December 29, 2019 is presented below:

Shares at December 29, 2019  16,769 2,174
The average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $121.31, $119.67 and $107.69 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, using the fair market
value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the
vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $585.9 million, $613.7 million and $596.5 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $124.67, $120.64 and $114.13 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, calculated using the
weighted average fair market value for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. 
The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value
of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value
for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The
fair value of performance share units issued was $119.1 million, $128.8 million and $132.5 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

20.Acquisitions and Divestitures
Certain businesses were acquired for $5.8 billion in cash and $1.4 billion of liabilities assumed during 2019. These acquisitions were accounted for using
the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
The 2019 acquisitions primarily included: DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad
range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products; Auris Health, Inc. a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung
cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and Taris Biomedical LLC a company
specializing in the development of a novel drug delivery technology for the treatment of bladder diseases including cancer. The Company also acquired the
assets of JointPoint, Inc., a privately held company, with navigation software to improve surgical outcomes in hip replacement.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $6.8 billion and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.
On January 17, 2019, the Company acquired DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad
range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of approximately ¥230 billion, which equates to approximately $2.1
billion, using the exchange rate of 109.06 Japanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. The acquisition was completed through a series of
transactions that included an all-cash tender offer to acquire the publicly held shares not already held by the Company for ¥5,900 per share. The Company
previously held a 20% ownership in DR. CI:LABO. As of June 2019, the Company became the legal owner of DR. CI:LABO with the completion of the
tender offer procedure in Japan. The acquired company was then delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2019,
the Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held
equity investment in DR. CI:LABO.
The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Consumer segment. The allocation of the purchase price
included in the current period balance sheet is based on the best estimate of management and is preliminary and subject to change. At December 29, 2019,
the fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable intangible assets for $1.5 billion, goodwill for $1.2 billion and liabilities of $0.4
billion subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. The adjustments made since the date of acquisition were $0.1
billion to intangible assets, accrued liabilities, deferred taxes on income and property, plant and equipment with the offset to goodwill. The amortizable
intangible assets were comprised of brand/trademarks and customer relationships with a weighted average life of 15.3 years The goodwill is primarily
attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
On April 1, 2019 the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion, net of cash acquired. Additional
contingent payments of up to $2.35 billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health was a privately
held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of
the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D for $3.0 billion, goodwill for $2.0 billion,
marketable securities of $0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $1.8 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent payments mentioned above,
subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. As of December 29, 2019 there were no valuation adjustments. The fair
value of the contingent consideration was $1.1 billion. A probability of success factor ranging from 55% to 95% was used in the fair value calculation to
reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the contingent payments and IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 10%. The goodwill is
primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
On December 20, 2019, the Company announced the agreement to acquire Verily's stake in Verb Surgical Inc. The transaction closed in the fiscal first
quarter of 2020 and Verb Surgical Inc. is now a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.
On December 30, 2019, subsequent to the fiscal year end, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational compound
bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc., for a purchase price of $0.8 billion.
XBiotech may be eligible to receive additional payments upon the receipt of certain commercialization authorizations. The transaction will be accounted
for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment.
During 2018 certain businesses were acquired for $0.9 billion in cash and $0.1 billion of liabilities assumed during 2018. These acquisitions were
accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates
of acquisition.
The 2018 acquisitions primarily included: Zarbee’s, Inc., a privately held company that is a leader in naturally-based consumer healthcare products;
BeneVir Biopharm, Inc. (BeneVir), a privately-held, biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of oncolytic immunotherapies and
Orthotaxy, a privately-held developer of software-enabled surgery technologies, including a differentiated robotic-assisted surgery solution. The Company
also acquired the assets of Medical Enterprises Distribution LLC, a privately held healthcare technology firm focused on surgical procedure innovation.

The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $1.0 billion and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.
During 2017 certain businesses were acquired for $35.2 billion in cash and $1.8 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for
using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of
acquisition.
The 2017 acquisitions primarily included: Actelion Ltd, an established leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH); Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, which included ophthalmic products related to:
cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health; Neuravi Limited, a privately-held medical device company that develops and markets
medical devices for neurointerventional therapy; TearScience Inc., a manufacturer of products dedicated to treating meibomian gland dysfunction;
Sightbox, Inc., a privately-held company that developed a subscription vision care service that connects consumers with eye care professionals and a supply
of contact lenses; Torax Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that manufactures and markets the LINX™ Reflux Management System
for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that develops,
manufactures and markets electrosurgical tools.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $34.4 billion and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $1.1 billion has been identified as the value of IPR&D, primarily
associated with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the
projects.
During 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Actelion Ltd through an all cash tender offer in Switzerland for $280 per share, amounting to
$29.6 billion, net of cash acquired. As part of the transaction, immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition, Actelion spun out its drug discovery
operations and early-stage clinical development assets into a newly created Swiss biopharmaceutical company, Idorsia Ltd. The shares of Idorsia are listed
on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX). In 2017 the Company held 9.9% of the shares of Idorsia and had rights to an additional 22.1% of Idorsia equity through
a convertible loan with a principal amount of approximately $0.5 billion. As a result of Idorsia raising additional capital in July 2018, the
Company currently holds 9.0% of the shares of Idorsia and has rights to an additional 20.8% of Idorsia equity through a convertible loan with a carrying
value and a principal amount of approximately $0.5 billion. The convertible loan may be converted into 38,715,114 Idorsia shares, subject to certain
restrictions, as follows: (i) up to an aggregate shareholding of 16% of Idorsia shares as a result of certain shareholders holding more than 20% of the issued
Idorsia shares, and (ii) up to the balance of the remaining amount within 20 business days of the maturity date of the convertible loan, which has a 10 year
term, or if Idorsia undergoes a change of control transaction. At the maturity of the loan, if the remaining amount has not yet been converted, Idorsia may
elect to settle the remaining amount in cash or in ordinary shares of Idorsia. The equity investment in Idorsia and the convertible loan are recorded in Other
assets in the Company's consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company also exercised the option acquired on ACT-132577, a product within Idorsia being
developed for resistant hypertension currently in phase 3 of clinical development. The Company has also entered into an agreement to provide Idorsia with
a Swiss franc denominated credit facility of approximately $250 million. As of December 29, 2019, Idorsia has not made any draw-downs under the credit
facility. Actelion has established a leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that are highly
complementary to the existing portfolio of the Company. The addition of Actelion’s specialty in-market medicines and late-stage products is consistent
with the Company's efforts to grow in attractive and complementary therapeutic areas and serve patients with serious illnesses and significant unmet
medical need.

During the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation for Actelion to the individual assets acquired and
liabilities assumed using the acquisition method. The following table presents the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the
acquisition date with adjustments made through the second quarter of 2018:
(Dollars in Millions)  
Cash & Cash equivalents 469
Inventory(1)759
Accounts Receivable 485
Other current assets 93
Property, plant and equipment 104
Goodwill 6,161
Intangible assets 25,010
Deferred Taxes 99
Other non-current assets 19
Total Assets Acquired 33,199
Current liabilities 956
Deferred Taxes 1,776
Other non-current liabilities 413
Total Liabilities Assumed 3,145
Net Assets Acquired 30,054
(1) Includes adjustment of $642 million to write-up the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value.
The adjustments made since the date of acquisition were $0.2 billion to the deferred taxes and $0.4 billion to the current liabilities with the offset to
goodwill. The assets acquired are recorded in the Pharmaceutical segment. The acquisition of Actelion resulted in approximately $6.2 billion of goodwill.
The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The purchase price allocation to the identifiable intangible assets is as follows:
(Dollars in Millions)   
Intangible assets with definite lives:   
Patents and trademarks*  $ 24,230
Total amortizable intangibles  24,230
   
In-process research and development  780
Total intangible assets  $ 25,010
*Includes $0.4 billion related to VALCHLOR®, one of the acquired products, which was divested in the fiscal second quarter of 2018.
The patents and trademarks acquired are comprised of developed technology with a weighted average life of 9 years and was primarily based on the
patent life of the marketed products. The intangible assets with definite lives were assigned asset lives ranging from 4 to 10 years. The in-process research
and development intangible assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products.
The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount
rate applied was 9%.
The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of operations of Actelion were reported in the Company's
financial statements beginning on June 16, 2017, the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2017, total sales and a net loss for Actelion from
the date of acquisition were $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.
The following table provides pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as if Actelion had been acquired as of
January 4, 2016. The pro forma results include the effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimated changes in depreciation and
amortization expense on the acquired tangible and intangible assets. However, pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects
of the planned integration of Actelion.

Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results if the acquisition had occurred on the dates indicated or which may occur in the
future.
 Unaudited Pro forma
Consolidated Results
(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Data) 2017
Net Sales 77,681
Net Earnings 1,509
Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share 0.55
The Company recorded Actelion acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $0.2 billion, $0.2 billion and $0.8 billion in 2019, 2018 and
2017, respectively, which was recorded in Other (income)/expense and Cost of products sold.
During 2017, the Company acquired Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, for $4.3 billion, net of cash
acquired. The acquisition included ophthalmic products related to: cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health. The net purchase
price was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $2.3 billion and goodwill for $1.7 billion. The weighted average life of total amortizable
intangibles, the majority being customer relationships, is approximately 14.4 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise
from the business acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets and goodwill amounts are based on the final purchase price
allocation. The assets acquired were recorded in the Medical Devices segment.
In 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. for a purchase price of $20.2 billion in cash and stock. In connection with the
acquisition of Synthes, Inc. the Company entered into two accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements. In 2013, the Company settled the remaining
liabilities under the ASR agreements. While the Company believes that the transactions under each ASR agreement and a series of related internal
transactions were consummated in a tax efficient manner in accordance with applicable law, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could assert one
or more contrary positions to challenge the transactions from a tax perspective. If challenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the Synthes
shares could be treated as subject to applicable U.S. tax at approximately the statutory rate to the Company, plus interest.
With the exception of the Actelion Ltd acquisition, supplemental pro forma information for 2019, 2018 and 2017 in accordance with U.S. GAAP
standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did
not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
Divestitures
During 2019, the Company divested its Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) business to Fortive Corporation for an aggregate value of
approximately $2.8 billion, consisting of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and $0.1 billion of retained net receivables. As of December 30, 2018, the assets
held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $0.2 billion of inventory, $0.1 billion of property, plant and equipment, net and $0.3 billion of
goodwill. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $2.0 billion.
During 2018, the Company divested the LifeScan Inc business for approximately $2.1 billion and retained certain net liabilities. Other divestitures in
2018 included: NIZORAL®, RoC® and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. In 2018, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately
$1.2 billion.
In 2018, the Company accepted a binding offer to form a strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., one of the world’s leading manufacturing services
providers for health care products and technology products. The Company is expanding a 12-year relationship with Jabil to produce a range of products
within the Ethicon Endo-Surgery and DePuy Synthes businesses. This transaction includes the transfer of employees and manufacturing sites. The majority
of the transfers were completed in 2019 with a minor amount remaining in 2020. As of December 29, 2019, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet were $0.1 billion of inventory and property, plant and equipment, net. As of December 30, 2018, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet were $0.3 billion of inventory and $0.1 billion of property, plant and equipment, net. For additional details on the global supply chain
restructuring see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
During 2017, the Company divestitures primarily included: the Codman Neurosurgery business, to Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation and the
divestiture of COMPEED® to HRA Pharma. In 2017, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $1.3 billion.

21.Legal Proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial,
supplier indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of
their business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount
of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 29, 2019, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters
are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust
accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and
regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss
beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be
affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and
legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in
dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; or there are numerous parties involved.
To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable
and can be reasonably estimated.
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal
proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.
However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.
PRODUCT LIABILITY
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in
these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible
to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a
variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on
currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each
matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as
estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of
claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as
additional information becomes available.
The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE®
Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL®; XARELTO®; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS® Baby Powder;
INVOKANA®; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible Composite Mesh. As of December 29, 2019, in the United States there were approximately 1,100
plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip
Resurfacing System; 10,300 with respect to the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System; 17,600 with respect to pelvic meshes; 11,900 with respect to
RISPERDAL®; 29,000 with respect to XARELTO®; 17,900 with respect to body powders containing talc; 400 with respect to INVOKANA®; and 3,300
with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible Composite Mesh.
In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip
Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of
pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the
United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been
filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013,
DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims
with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy
reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had
revision surgeries after
                
 84
                                
August 31, 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, therefore bringing to resolution significant
ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation
outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country.
In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle two pending class actions which have been approved by the Québec Superior Court and the
Supreme Court of British Columbia. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on
a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and DePuy ASR™ Hip-related
product liability litigation.
Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, DePuy) relating to the
PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to
receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been
organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in some state
courts and in countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts have been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and
remanded for retrial. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the
settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the
PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.
Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to
treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional
cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of West Virginia. The MDL Court is remanding cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic
mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and
the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition, class actions and
individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium, and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's
pelvic mesh devices. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the
three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the
devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Orders determining the damages amounts to be awarded to the three
Lead Applicants are expected in the first quarter of 2020. With respect to other group members, there will be an individual case assessment process which
will require proof of use and causally related loss. The class actions in Canada are expected to be discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group
of cases, subject to court approval of the discontinuance. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with
Ethicon's pelvic mesh products.
Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible Composite Mesh, claims for personal injury have been made
against Ethicon, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device.  Cases filed in federal courts in the
United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-
county litigation (MCL) has also been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the
matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of
the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending outside the United States.
Along with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® lawsuits, there were a number of filings related to the PROCEED® Mesh and PROCEED® Ventral Patch products.
In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating all PROCEED® and PROCEED® Ventral Patch cases as an MCL in Atlantic
County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the US, and in jurisdictions outside the US. The Company
continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established accruals with respect to
product liability litigation associated with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED® Mesh and PROCEED® Ventral Patch
products. In September 2019, plaintiffs’ attorney filed an application with the New Jersey Supreme Court seeking centralized management of 107
PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System cases.   The New Jersey Supreme Court granted plaintiffs application in January 2020 and those will be
transferred to an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court.
                
 85
                                
Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL®, indicated
for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism, and related
compounds. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the
United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs
and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company,
including a recent verdict in October 2019 of $8 billion of punitive damages related to one single plaintiff which was subsequently reduced in January 2020
to $6.8 million by the trial judge. The Company will appeal the final judgment. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the United States
cases and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals.
Claims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO®, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI);
Johnson & Johnson (J&J); and JPI's collaboration partner for XARELTO® Bayer AG and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United
States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases have been
filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases have been consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and
in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and J&J announced an
agreement in principle to the settle the XARELTO® cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, and the settlement
became final in December 2019. This will resolve the majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs
associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO® related product liability litigation.
Personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the
use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S® Baby Powder. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and
the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in
state courts in Missouri, New Jersey and California, as well as outside the United States. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been
organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the multi-district litigation, the parties have
moved to exclude experts, known as Daubert motions. The Court held Daubert hearings in mid-July 2019 and a final round of briefing has been submitted
to the Court. The parties are awaiting a decision. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the
Company, including a verdict in July 2018 of $4.7 billion. The Company believes that it has strong grounds on appeal to overturn these verdicts. The
Company has established an accrual primarily for defense costs in connection with product liability litigation associated with body powders containing talc.
In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc.
(collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary chapter 11 petition commencing a reorganization under the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy).  The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’ potential liability for personal injury from
exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys (Talc Claims).  In its bankruptcy filing, Imerys noted certain claims it alleges it has against the Company for
indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds.  Based on such claims as well as indemnity and insurance claims the Company has against Imerys,
the Company petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Delaware to establish federal jurisdiction of the state court talc lawsuits under
the Bankruptcy Code.  The Company's petition was denied and the state court talc lawsuits that have been removed to federal court on such basis have been
remanded.   The Company formally proposed to resolve Imerys' and the Company’s obligations arising out of the Talc Claims by agreeing to assume the
defense of litigation of all Talc Claims involving the Company's products, lifting the automatic stay to enable the Talc Claims to proceed outside the
bankruptcy forum with the Company agreeing to settle or pay any judgment against Imerys, and waiving the Company’s indemnification claims against
Imerys. Discussions between Imerys and the Company on this issue remain ongoing. 
In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers in the United States District Court for
the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose the alleged asbestos
contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses
as a result.  Plaintiffs are seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete as of
August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss.
In October 2018, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors as defendants in
the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body
powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S® Baby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In
June 2019, the shareholder filed an additional
                
 86
                                
complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books and records inspection. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson responded to
the books and records complaint and filed a cross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the Court heard oral argument. The Court has
not yet ruled in the books and records action. In September 2019, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey granted defendants’ motion
to dismiss the shareholder derivative lawsuit, and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. In October 2019, the shareholder filed a notice of appeal with
the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In January 2020, the shareholder voluntarily dismissed his appeal, with prejudice. Four additional
shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in New Jersey making similar allegations against the Company and its current directors and certain officers.
In January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan against Johnson & Johnson, its
Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants
breached their fiduciary duties by offering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do
so because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S® Baby Powder.  Plaintiffs are
seeking damages and injunctive relief. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.
A lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging violations of Proposition 65, California’s Unfair
Competition Law and False Advertising Law concerning JOHNSON’S® Baby Powder. In June 2019, plaintiffs filed a motion for voluntary dismissal of
this Proposition 65 action and the Company opposed such motion to the extent it would allow plaintiffs’ counsel to refile such claims with new plaintiffs.
The Court granted plaintiff’s motion conditioned upon payment of attorneys’ fees and costs. The Court entered its award of attorneys’ fees and costs in
October 2019 and the case was dismissed without prejudice. Another lawsuit alleging violations of Proposition 65, California’s Consumer Legal Remedies
Act relating to JOHNSON’S® Baby Powder was filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego. In July 2019, the Company filed a
notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly
thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,
primarily on the basis that the plaintiffs failed to comply with Proposition 65’s mandatory pre-suit notice requirement, which applies even when a plaintiff
asserts only an indirect Proposition 65 claim. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company
moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
In addition, the Company has received preliminary inquiries and subpoenas to produce documents regarding these matters from Senator Murray, a member
of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S.
Congressional Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. The Company is cooperating with government inquiries and continues to produce
documents in response.     
Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson &
Johnson, arising out of the use of INVOKANA®, a prescription medication indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. Lawsuits
filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the
Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has settled or otherwise
resolved many of the cases and claims in the United States and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual
property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products
and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial
defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in
any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity,
require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. The most
significant of these matters are described below.
                
 87
                                
Medical Devices
In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson & Johnson in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Cordis’s sales of the CYPHER™ and CYPHER SELECT™ stents made in the
United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents. Although Johnson & Johnson has since
sold Cordis, it has retained liability for this case. After the trial in January 2014, the district court dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed
bringing its claims (the laches defense). In September 2014, the district court denied a motion by Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial.
Medinol appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the United States Supreme Court held that the
laches defense is not available in patent cases. In April 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the case back to the
district court to reconsider Medinol’s motion for a new trial. In March 2019, the district court denied Medinol’s motion for a new trial. In April 2019,
Medinol filed a notice of appeal.
In November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE® Knee System. In April 2017, MedIdea filed an amended complaint adding DePuy
Synthes Products, Inc. and DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. as named defendants (collectively, DePuy). MedIdea alleges infringement of United States Patent
Nos. 6,558,426 (’426); 8,273,132 (’132); 8,721,730 (’730) and 9,492,280 (’280) relating to posterior stabilized knee systems. Specifically, MedIdea alleges
that the SOFCAMTM Contact feature of the ATTUNE® posterior stabilized knee products infringes the patents-in-suit. MedIdea is seeking monetary
damages and injunctive relief. In June 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. A claim
construction hearing was held in October 2018, and a claim construction order was issued in November 2018. In December 2018, MedIdea stipulated to
non-infringement of the ’132, ’730 and ’280 patents, based on the district court’s claim construction and reserving its right to appeal that construction,
leaving only the ’426 patent at issue before the district court. In January 2019, the district court stayed the case pending a decision in the Inter Partes
Review proceeding on the ’426 patent (see below). In December 2017, DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. filed a petition for Inter Partes Review with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), seeking to invalidate the two claims of the ’426 patent asserted in the district court litigation, and in
June 2018, the USPTO instituted review of those claims. A hearing was held in March 2019, and in April 2019, the USPTO issued its decision upholding
the validity of the patent. In May 2019, DePuy filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the claims of the ’426 patent. In November
2019, judgment was entered in favor of Depuy. In December 2019, MedIdea filed a notice of appeal.
In December 2016, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, LLC (now known as Ethicon LLC) sued Covidien, Inc. in the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that United States Patent Nos. 6,585,735 (the ’735 patent); 7,118,587; 7,473,253;
8,070,748 and 8,241,284 (the ’284 patent), are either invalid or not infringed by Ethicon’s ENSEAL® X1 Large Jaw Tissue Sealer product. In April 2017,
Covidien LP, Covidien Sales LLC, and Covidien AG (collectively, Covidien) answered and counterclaimed, denying the allegations, asserting willful
infringement of the ’735 patent, the ’284 patent and United States Patent Nos. 8,323,310 (the ’310 patent); 9,084,608; 9,241,759 (the ’759 patent) and
9,113,882, and seeking damages and an injunction. Covidien filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which was denied in October 2017. The parties have
entered joint stipulations such that only the ’310 patent and the ’759 patent remain in dispute. Trial began in September 2019, and closing arguments will
be heard in March 2020.
In December 2016, Dr. Ford Albritton sued Acclarent, Inc. (Acclarent) in United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging that
Acclarent’s RELIEVA® Spin and RELIEVEA SpinPlus® products infringe U.S. Patent No. 9,011,412 (the ’412 patent). Dr. Albritton also alleges breach of
contract, fraud and that he is the true owner of Acclarent’s U.S. Patent No. 8,414,473. In December 2016, Acclarent filed a petition for Inter Partes Review
(IPR) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) challenging the validity of the ’412 patent. The USPTO instituted the IPR in July 2017.
In July 2018, the USPTO ruled in favor of Albritton in the IPR, finding that Acclarent had not met its burden of proof that the challenged claims were
invalid. In October 2019, the Court of Appeals affirmed the USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board. In June 2019, the parties filed cross motions for
summary judgment in the district court and the parties are awaiting a decision. The district court trial is scheduled for April 2020.
In November 2017, Board of Regents, The University of Texas System and TissueGen, Inc. (collectively, UT) filed a lawsuit in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Texas against Ethicon, Inc. and Ethicon US, LLC alleging the manufacture and sale of VICRYL® Plus Antibacterial
Sutures, MONOCRYL® Plus Antibacterial Sutures, PDS® Plus Antibacterial Sutures, STRATAFIX® PDS® Antibacterial Sutures and STRATAFIX®
MONOCRYL® Plus Antibacterial Sutures infringe plaintiffs’ United States Patent Nos. 6,596,296 and 7,033,603 (the ’603 patent) directed to implantable
polymer drug releasing biodegradable fibers containing a therapeutic agent. UT is seeking damages and an injunction. In December 2018, Ethicon filed
petitions with the USPTO, seeking Inter Partes Review (IPR) of both asserted patents. Those petitions have been stayed by the USPTO pending a decision
by the U.S. Supreme Court in an unrelated case. UT dismissed the ’603 patent from
                
 88
                                
the suit and no longer accuses PDS® Plus Antibacterial Sutures or STRATAFIX® PDS® Plus Antibacterial Sutures of infringement. The district court trial
is scheduled for June 2020.
In August 2018, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc. (“Intuitive”) filed a patent infringement suit against Auris Health, Inc.

Pharmaceutical
In August 2016, Sandoz Ltd and Hexal AG (collectively, Sandoz) filed a lawsuit in the English High Court against G.D. Searle LLC, a Pfizer company
(Searle) and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (JSI) alleging that Searle’s supplementary protection certificate SPC/GB07/038 (SPC), which is exclusively
licensed to JSI, is invalid and should be revoked. Janssen-Cilag Limited sells PREZISTA® (darunavir) in the United Kingdom pursuant to this license. In
October 2016, Searle and JSI counterclaimed against Sandoz for threatened infringement of the SPC based on statements of its plans to launch generic
darunavir in the United Kingdom. Sandoz admitted that its generic darunavir product would infringe the SPC if it is found valid. Searle and JSI are seeking
an order enjoining Sandoz from marketing its generic darunavir before the expiration of the SPC. Following a trial in April 2017, the court entered a
decision holding that the SPC is valid and granting a final injunction. Sandoz has appealed the court’s decision and the injunction is stayed pending the
appeal. In January 2018, the court referred the issue on appeal to the Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) and stayed the proceedings pending
the CJEU’s ruling on the issue. In December 2019, the parties entered into a settlement agreement.
In April 2018, Acerta Pharma B.V., AstraZeneca UK Ltd and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware against Pharmacyclics LLC and Abbvie Inc. (collectively, Abbvie), alleging that the manufacture and sale of

action in November 2018. In October 2019, the parties entered into a settlement agreement.
REMICADE® Related Cases
In August 2014, Celltrion Healthcare Co. Ltd. and Celltrion Inc. (collectively, Celltrion) filed an application with the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for approval to make and sell its own infliximab biosimilar. In March 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) filed a lawsuit in the United
States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira), which has exclusive marketing
rights for Celltrion’s infliximab biosimilar in the United States, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product infringes
or potentially infringes several JBI patents, including United States Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE® (infliximab) (the ’471 patent) and
United States Patent No. 7,598,083 (the ’083 patent) directed to the cell culture media used to make Celltrion’s biosimilar. In August 2016, the district court
granted both Celltrion’s and Hospira’s motions for summary judgment of invalidity of the ’471 patent. JBI appealed those decisions to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In January 2018, the Federal Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot based on its affirmance of a decision by the
USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board affirming invalidity of the ’471 patent.
In June 2016, JBI filed two additional patent infringement lawsuits asserting the ’083 patent, one against Celltrion and Hospira in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts and the other against HyClone Laboratories, Inc., the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to
make its biosimilar product, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. JBI seeks monetary damages and other relief. In October 2017, the
district court in the Massachusetts
                
 89
                                
action denied Celltrion and Hospira’s motion to dismiss for lack of standing. In July 2018, the district court in the Massachusetts action granted Celltrion’s
motion for summary judgment of non-infringement and entered an order dismissing the ’083 lawsuit against Celltrion and Hospira. JBI appealed to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and Celltrion and Hospira cross-appealed on the standing issue. A hearing on the appeal and cross-
appeal is scheduled for March 2020. The litigation against HyClone in Utah is stayed pending the outcome of the Massachusetts actions.
The FDA approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the United States in 2016, and a number of such products have been launched.
Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)
The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA or
undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson &
Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and
invalidity of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before
the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce
generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and
which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these types of
actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant
patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the 2011 America Invents Act,
is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents.
ZYTIGA® 
In July 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc. and Janssen Research & Development, LLC (collectively, Janssen) and BTG International Ltd.

generic companies (and certain of their affiliates and/or suppliers) who filed ANDAs seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA® 250mg
before the expiration of United States Patent No. 8,822,438 (the ’438 patent). The generic companies include Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Amneal
Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC (collectively, Amneal); Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex); Citron Pharma LLC (Citron); Dr.
Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, Dr. Reddy’s); Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc. (collectively,

In April 2018, Janssen and BTG entered into a settlement agreement with Apotex.
                
 90
                                
In October 2018, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a ruling invalidating all asserted claims of the ’438 patent. The court
held that the patent claims would be infringed if the patent were valid. Janssen appealed the court’s decision.
In November 2018, Janssen and BTG initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Qilu
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Qilu Pharma, Inc. (collectively, Qilu), who filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA® before
the expiration of the ’438 patent. Janssen is seeking an order enjoining Qilu from marketing its generic version of ZYTIGA® before the expiration of the
’438 patent.
In November 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Janssen’s request for an injunction pending appeal. As a result,
several generic versions of ZYTIGA® have entered the market.
Several generic companies including Amerigen, Argentum Pharmaceuticals LLC (Argentum), Mylan, Wockhardt, Actavis, Amneal, Dr. Reddy’s, Sun,
Teva, West-Ward and Hikma filed Petitions for Inter Partes Review (IPR) with the USPTO, seeking to invalidate the ’438 patent. In January 2018, the
USPTO issued decisions finding the ’438 patent claims unpatentable, and Janssen requested rehearing. In December 2018, the USPTO denied Janssen’s
request for rehearing of the IPR decisions. Janssen filed an appeal, which was consolidated with the above-mentioned appeal of the decision of the United
States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In May 2019, the Federal Circuit issued a decision affirming the USPTO's decision in the Wockhardt
IPR that the ’438 patent claims are unpatentable and dismissed the remaining appeals as moot. Subsequently, Janssen dismissed its lawsuits against MSN
and Qilu.
In November 2017, Janssen initiated a Notice of Application under Section 6 of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations against
Apotex Inc. (Apotex) and the Minister of Health in Canada in response to Apotex’s filing of an Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS) seeking
approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA® before the expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,661,422 (the ’422 patent). The final hearing concluded in

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS
Like other companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to
extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction
with government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It
is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.
Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation
Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were
named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical
products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average
Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in
these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state
government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed
to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,
where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after
trial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen
Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been resolved.
Opioid Litigation
Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies,
have been named in more than 2,800 lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC®,
NUCYNTA® and NUCYNTA® ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries,
Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries were divested in 2016).  Similar lawsuits have also been filed by the following groups
of plaintiffs: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health insurers/payors.  To date,
complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI, have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida,
Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New
                
 96
                                
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Complaints against the
manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama, Arkansas,
California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina; Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee,
Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. There are more
than 350 cases pending in various state courts. There are over 2,500 federal cases coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (MDL No. 2804). In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit in Canada. In October 2019,
an anti-trust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of
claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and
practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the
plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large
monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.
The trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson & Johnson and JPI in the amount of $572 million,
subject to a final order to be issued by the court.  The court issued a final judgment reducing the amount to $465 million. Johnson & Johnson and JPI have
appealed the judgment. The Company believes that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment.  In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI
announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio.
Johnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing
practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In
September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states
regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the
Company paying $4 billion as settlement of these lawsuits, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement in principle is
not an admission of liability or wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities and counties. The Company cannot
predict if or when the agreement will be finalized and individual cases are ongoing, including a trial in New York scheduled to commence in March 2020.
 
In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York for
documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution of its opioid medications, in what the Company understands to
be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act.  In
September 2019, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) as part of an industry-wide
inquiry into the effect of opioid prescriptions on New York health insurance premiums.  The Company is cooperating and producing documents in response
to the various subpoenas and requests for information.
Other
In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy)
received an informal request from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States
Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR™ XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States
notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False
Claims Act against the companies. In February 2016, the district court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam
complaint, and denied the qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the
decision to deny the relators’ request to file a third amended complaint. The relators’ remaining claims are now pending before the district court, and fact
discovery is currently scheduled to close in March 2020.
In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of
the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson & Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). In May
2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer
protection statutes. In April 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the Washington case. The California case started trial in July 2019 and concluded
in September
                
 97
                                
2019. In January 2020, the court found in favor of the state and awarded the state civil penalties of approximately $344 million. The Company intends to
appeal when further proceedings are concluded in the trial court. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by Kentucky in August 2016, by
Mississippi in October 2017, by West Virginia in September 2019 and by Oregon in December 2019. The trial date for the Kentucky case was scheduled
for September 2019 but has been adjourned and no new trial date has been scheduled. In October 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the multi-
state investigation with 41 other states and the District of Columbia.
In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD)
franchise, received a letter from the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania informing Therakos that
the United States Attorney's Office was investigating the sales and marketing of Uvadex® (methoxsalen) and the Uvar Xts® and Cellex® Systems during the
period 2000 to the present. The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson & Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the
investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013, and OCD was divested in June 2014.
Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson & Johnson retains OCD’s portion of any liability that may result from the investigation for activity that
occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. In March 2014 and March 2016, the United States Attorney’s Office requested that Johnson & Johnson produce
certain documents, and Johnson & Johnson is cooperating with those requests.
In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against
Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI). The complaint alleges
that defendants violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by
failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S® Shower
to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. The matter is stayed pending interlocutory appeal of a December 2018
denial of Johnson & Johnson and JJCI's motion for summary judgment. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted J&J and JJCI's request to file an
interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in late 2019 and it will soon establish a briefing schedule. The Company has also
received inquiries from several other State Attorneys General.
In March 2016, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern
District of New York related to JPI’s contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers over the period from January 1, 2006 to the present with
regard to certain of JPI's pharmaceutical products. The demand was issued in connection with an investigation under the False Claims Act.
In July 2016, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Products LP were served with a qui tam complaint pursuant to the False Claims Act filed in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging the off-label promotion of two HIV products, PREZISTA® and INTELENCE®, and anti-kickback
violations in connection with the promotion of these products.  The complaint was filed under seal in December 2012.  The federal and state governments
have declined to intervene, and the lawsuit is being prosecuted by the relators. 
In January 2017, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice relating to
allegations concerning the sales and marketing practices of OLYSIO®. In December 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were served with a whistleblower
lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging the off-label promotion of OLYSIO® and additional products,
including NUCYNTA®, XARELTO®, LEVAQUIN® and REMICADE®.  At this time, the federal and state governments have declined to intervene and the
lawsuit, which is related to the Civil Investigative Demand, is being prosecuted by a former company employee.  The United States District Court for the
Central District of California dismissed the claim in April 2018. In May 2018, the relator filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit. In January 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed the relator's appeal.
In November 2018, a second whistleblower lawsuit was unsealed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The lawsuit was
substantially similar to the lawsuit under appeal but was brought in the name of the original relator. The federal and state governments declined to intervene
in the second suit, and the relator moved to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice. In April 2019, the court granted the relator's motion and dismissed the
complaint without prejudice.
In March 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice regarding a False Claims Act
investigation concerning management and advisory services provided to rheumatology and gastroenterology practices that purchased REMICADE® or
SIMPONI ARIA®. In August 2019, the Unites States Department of Justice notified Janssen Biotech, Inc. that it was closing the investigation. In January
2020, Janssen Biotech, Inc. was served with a newly-unsealed qui tam suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

In April and September 2017, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts seeking documents
broadly relating to pharmaceutical copayment support programs for DARZALEX®, OLYSIO®, REMICADE®, SIMPONI®, STELARA® and
ZYTIGA®. The subpoenas also seek documents relating to Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price reporting to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid
Services related to those products, as well as rebate payments to state Medicaid agencies.
In June 2017, Johnson & Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking information
regarding practices pertaining to the sterilization of DePuy Synthes, Inc. spinal implants at three hospitals in Boston as well as interactions of employees of
Company subsidiaries with physicians at these hospitals. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy Synthes, Inc. have produced documents in response to the
subpoena and are fully cooperating with the government’s investigation.
In July 2018 the Public Prosecution Service in Rio de Janeiro and representatives from the Brazilian antitrust authority CADE inspected the offices of more
than 30 companies including Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. The authorities appear to be investigating
allegations of possible anti-competitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry. The United States Department of Justice
and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission have made additional inquiries, and Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de
Produtos para Saúde Ltda. is cooperating with those requests.
In January 2020, the New Mexico Attorney General’s Office filed a suit against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. in
the First Judicial District Court, New Mexico. The suit relates to the safety and marketing of the Company’s talc products. The State included claims for
violations of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act, Medicaid Fraud Act, Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation, Negligence
and Unjust Enrichment. Other state Attorneys General have informed the Company that they are conducting an inquiry into this matter.
From time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to
ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information.
GENERAL LITIGATION
In May 2014, two purported class actions were filed in federal court, one in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and one in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now
known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI) alleging violations of state consumer fraud statutes based on nondisclosure of alleged health risks
associated with talc contained in JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S® Shower to Shower (a product no longer sold by JJCI). Both cases seek
injunctive relief and monetary damages; neither includes a claim for personal injuries. In October 2016, both cases were transferred to the United States
District Court for the District Court of New Jersey as part of a newly created federal multi-district litigation. In July 2017, the district court granted Johnson
& Johnson's and JJCI’s motion to dismiss one of the cases. In September 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed this
dismissal. In September 2017, the plaintiff in the second case voluntarily dismissed the complaint. In March 2018, the plaintiff in the second case refiled in
Illinois State Court.
In August 2014, United States Customs and Border Protection (US CBP) issued a Penalty Notice against Janssen Ortho LLC (Janssen Ortho), assessing
penalties for the alleged improper classification of darunavir ethanolate (the active pharmaceutical ingredient in PREZISTA®) in connection with its
importation into the United States. In October 2014, Janssen Ortho submitted a Petition for Relief in response to the Penalty Notice. In May 2015, US CBP
issued an Amended Penalty Notice assessing substantial penalties and Janssen Ortho filed a Petition for Relief in July 2015. In May 2019, US CBP issued
its Mitigation Decision and determined that Janssen Ortho had negligently misrepresented that darunavir ethanolate is entitled to duty free treatment. In
June 2019, Janssen Ortho filed a Supplemental Petition for Relief. The Penalties Proceeding will be impacted by the related Classification Litigation
pending in the United States Court of International Trade. The Classification Litigation will determine whether darunavir ethanolate was properly classified
as exempt from duties upon importation into the United States. The trial in the Classification Litigation was held in July 2019. In February 2020, the Court
ruled that darunavir ethanolate is eligible for duty free treatment.
In March and April 2015, over 30 putative class action complaints were filed by contact lens patients in a number of courts around the United States against
Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) and other contact lens manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, alleging vertical and horizontal conspiracies
to fix the retail prices of contact lenses. The complaints
                
 99
                                
allege that the manufacturers reached agreements with each other and certain distributors and retailers concerning the prices at which some contact lenses
could be sold to consumers. The plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. All of the class action cases were transferred to the United States
District Court for the Middle District of Florida in June 2015. The plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint in November 2015. In December
2018, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Defendants filed two motions for interlocutory appeal of class certification to
the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Both motions were denied. Defendants' motions for summary judgment were denied in
November 2019. Trial is scheduled for June 2020.
In August 2015, two third-party payors filed a purported class action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against Janssen
Research & Development, LLC, Janssen Ortho LLC, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson
(as well as certain Bayer entities), alleging that the defendants improperly marketed and promoted XARELTO® as safer and more effective than less
expensive alternative medications while failing to fully disclose its risks. The complaint seeks damages.
In September 2017, Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) filed an antitrust complaint against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) in United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Pfizer alleges that Janssen has violated federal antitrust laws through its contracting strategies
for REMICADE®. The complaint seeks damages and injunctive relief. Discovery is ongoing.
Beginning in September 2017, multiple purported class actions of direct and indirect purchasers were filed against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Biotech,
Inc. (collectively, Janssen) alleging that Janssen’s REMICADE® contracting strategies violated federal and state antitrust and consumer laws and seeking
damages and injunctive relief. In November 2017, the cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania as In re Remicade Antitrust Litigation. Motions to dismiss were denied in both the direct and indirect purchaser cases. A motion to compel
arbitration of the direct purchaser case was denied by the district court. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the district court's
ruling.
In June 2018, Walgreen Co. and Kroger Co, filed an antitrust complaint against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint alleges that Janssen has violated federal antitrust laws through its
contracting strategies for REMICADE®. The complaint seeks damages and injunctive relief. In March 2019, summary judgment was granted in favor of
Janssen. This ruling is on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
In June 2019, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a Civil Investigative Demand to Johnson & Johnson in connection with its
investigation of whether Janssen’s REMICADE® contracting practices violate federal antitrust laws. The Company has produced documents and
information responsive to the Civil Investigative Demand.
 
In October 2017, certain United States service members and their families brought a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical and medical devices
companies, including Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the United States Anti-Terrorism Act.  The
complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical
device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health. In January 2019, plaintiffs' motion to file a Second Amended Complaint adding plaintiffs to the lawsuit
was granted. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint.
In October 2018, two separate putative class actions were filed against Actelion Pharmaceutical Ltd., Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc., and Actelion
Clinical Research, Inc. (collectively Actelion) in United States District Court for the District of Maryland and United States District Court for the District
of Columbia.  The complaints allege that Actelion violated state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws by allegedly refusing to supply generic
pharmaceutical manufacturers with samples of TRACLEER®.  TRACLEER® is subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which imposes
restrictions on distribution of the product.  In January 2019, the plaintiffs dismissed the District of Columbia case and filed a consolidated complaint in the
United States District Court for the District of Maryland.  In October 2019, the Court granted Actelion’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint.
Plaintiffs have appealed the decision.
 
In December 2018, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, Janssen)
were served with a qui tam complaint filed on behalf of the United States, 28 states, and the District of Columbia.  The complaint, which was filed in
December 2017 in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Janssen violated the federal False Claims Act and state
law when providing pricing information for ZYTIGA® to the government in connection with direct government sales and government-funded drug
                
 100
                                
reimbursement programs.  At this time, the federal and state governments have declined to intervene. The case has been transferred to United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey. Janssen has moved to dismiss the complaint.
In April 2019, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Louisiana and HMO Louisiana, Inc. filed a class action complaint against Janssen Biotech, Inc, Janssen
Oncology, Inc, Janssen Research & Development, LLC and BTG International Limited in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia. Several additional complaints were filed thereafter. The complaints generally allege that the defendants violated the antitrust and consumer
protections laws of several states and the Sherman Act
by pursuing patent litigation relating to ZYTIGA® in order to delay generic entry. The case has been transferred to the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey and consolidated for pretrial purposes. 
In May 2019, a class action antitrust complaint was filed against Janssen R&D Ireland (Janssen) and Johnson & Johnson. The complaint alleges that
Janssen violated federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws by agreeing to exclusivity provisions in its agreements with Gilead concerning the
development and marketing of combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) to treat HIV. The complaint also alleges that Gilead entered into similar
agreements with Bristol-Myers-Squibb and Japan Tobacco. The case is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Northern California.
The defendants have filed motions to dismiss the complaint.
In October 2019, Innovative Health, LLC filed a complaint against Biosense Webster, Inc. (BWI) in the United States District Court for the Middle District
of California. The complaint alleges that certain of BWI’s business practices and contractual terms violate the antitrust laws of the United States and the
State of California by restricting competition in the sale of High Density Mapping Catheters and Ultrasound Catheters. BWI filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint.
The Company received notices from Pfizer, Inc. and Sanofi Consumer Health, Inc. in November 2019 and Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in
January 2020 tendering for defense and indemnification of legal claims related to personal injury matters and putative class actions in the U.S. and Canada
related to Zantac (ranitidine) products. The notices were based on certain indemnification provisions regarding assumed liabilities in connection with the
Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement between Pfizer, Inc. and the Company in 2006. Plaintiffs in the underlying suits allege generally that Zantac and other
over-the-counter ranitidine medications contain unsafe levels of NDMA (N-nitrosodimethylamine) and can cause and/or have caused various cancers in
patients using the products, for which plaintiffs are seeking injunctive and monetary relief.
Johnson & Johnson or its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost
of past and/or future remediation.

22. Restructuring
The Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources and increase
investments in the critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility and drive
growth. The Global Supply Chain actions will include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce complexity, improve
cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network. For additional details on the global supply chain restructuring strategic
collaborations see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.6 billion, which is included on
the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.2 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost
of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $0.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See the following table for
additional details on the restructuring program.
In total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that
will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, over the
4 to 5 year period of this activity. These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.   
The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through the fiscal year ended 2019:
(Dollars in Millions) Severance Asset Write-offs Other(2) Total
Reserve balance, December 31, 2017 229 — 38 267
2018 activity (35) — 10 (25)
Reserve balance, December 30, 2018 194 — 48 242
Current year activity:      
   Charges — 151 460 611
   Cash payments (30) — (424) (454)
   Settled non cash — (151) (68)(3) (219)
Reserve balance, December 29, 2019(1)$ 164 — 16 180
(1) Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next 2 years  in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws.
(2) Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting these initiatives and consulting expenses.
(3) Relates to pension related actuarial losses associated with the transfer of employees to Jabil Inc. as part of the strategic collaboration.
The Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments due to the planned release of associates
regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing severance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans
given the period over which the actions will take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts
become probable and estimable.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 29, 2019 and
December 30, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity, and of cash flows for each of the three fiscal
years in the period ended December 29, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have
audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
December 29, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd., (“DR. CI:LABO”)
from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2019, because it was acquired by the Company in a business
combination during 2019. We have also excluded DR. CI:LABO from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. DR. CI:LABO is wholly-
owned subsidiary whose total assets, excluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total sales excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of
internal control over financial reporting represent less than 1% of each of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year
ended December 29, 2019.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and
                
 103
                                
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not
alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,
providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
U.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a
contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a
reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns and Promotions on the consolidated balance
sheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care,
Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.0 billion as of December 29, 2019. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S.
Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical
experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare
and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the use of significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in
developing these reserves. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity and audit effort in applying procedures for the assumptions
related to contractual terms with customers, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care,
Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i)
developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S., the terms of the specific
rebate programs, and the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating those
claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimate to
management’s estimates.
Litigation Contingencies - Talc
As described in Notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters,
including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts
have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
For these matters, management is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be
affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and
legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in
dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; or there are numerous parties involved.
There have been verdicts against the Company for this matter, including a verdict in July 2018 of $4.7 billion. As described by management, the Company
believes
                
 104
                                
that it has strong grounds on appeal to overturn these verdicts. The Company has established an accrual primarily for defense costs in connection with
product liability litigation associated with body powders containing talc.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a critical audit matter are the use of
significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and management’s determination of whether a reasonable
estimate of the loss or range of loss for each claim can be made. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in evaluating
management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including
controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures.
These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the talc
litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external
counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation;
(iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and
reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.
Litigation - Opioids
As described in Notes 18 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal
matters, including opioids, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse
verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably
estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often
result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related
payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in
the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional
issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; or there are numerous parties involved. The Company has been named in
numerous lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to opioids matters. The trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney
General resulted in a judgment against the Company in the amount of $572 million which was subsequently reduced to $465 million. The Company has
appealed the judgment and, as described by management, believes that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment. Separately in October 2019, the
Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of these lawsuits, subject to
various conditions and an agreement being finalized. The Company cannot predict if or when the agreement will be finalized. The Company has recorded a
pre-tax charge of $4 billion during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 for this matter.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the opioids litigation is a critical audit matter are the use of
significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred for the judgment against the Company in Oklahoma and
management’s determination of whether a reasonable estimate of the range of loss for the proposed agreement in principle to settle opioids litigation can be
made. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this
litigation.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the opioid litigation, including
controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures.
These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the opioids
litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and ongoing settlement negotiations with the Company’s in-house
legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal
counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably
possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the
preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2019. In
making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
“Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and
communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness
of its internal controls over financial reporting.
The Company acquired Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd., (DR. CI:LABO), in a business combination during January 2019. DR. CI:LABO's total assets,
excluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total sales represented less than 1% of each of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and
for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. As the acquisition occurred in the fiscal year 2019, the scope of the Company's assessment of the design and
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year 2019 excluded the above mentioned acquisition. This exclusion is in accordance
with the SEC's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope in the year of acquisition.
Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 29, 2019, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President,
Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Gorsky and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of
the period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to
"Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting", and the attestation regarding internal controls over financial reporting included in
the "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" included in Item 8 of this Report.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  During the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2019, there were no changes in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human
resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s
financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and
operation of its financial control environment.
