Business ABOUT US
Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix
”, “the Company”, “registrant”, “we”, or “us”) is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 204 million paidmemberships in over 190 countr
ies enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch asmuch as they want, anytime, anywhe
re, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally,we continue to offer our DVD-by-mai
l service in the United States (“U.S.”).We are a pioneer in th
e delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem forinternet-connected screens an
d have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens.As a result of these effor
ts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.Our core strategy is to grow our st
reaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuouslyimproving our members' expe
rience by expanding our content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members.In addition, we are continuously 
enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can downloada selection of titl
es for offline viewing.BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We operate as one opera
ting segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to ourmembers. See Note 12, 
Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to ou r consolidated financial statements for further detail.COMPETITION
The market for video entertai
nment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such asmultichannel video progr
amming distributors (“MVPDs”), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gamingproviders and more broadly ag
ainst other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete againststreaming enterta
inment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.While consumers may ma
intain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments offree time. We have o
ften referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of1

Table of Contentstruth." In attempting to win 
these moments of truth with our members, we are continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content,which is increasingly exclus
ive and curated, and includes our original programming.SEASONALITY
Our membership growth exhibits a s
easonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increasetheir viewing. Historical
ly, the first and fourth quarters (October through March) represent our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membershipgrowth can be impacted by our con
tent release schedule and changes to pricing.INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectualproperty as important to ou
r success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect ourproprietary intell
ectual property. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute throughour service. We use the in
tellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability toprovide our members with cont
ent they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, tosuch content and certain 
related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and theterms and conditions of such l
icenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time weencounter disputes over righ
ts and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual propertydisputes.
REGULATION
The media landscape and th
e internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in manycountries. We are see
ing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing somecountries update their 
cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some evenrestrict the exten
t of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that couldrequire formal rev
iews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may makeoperating in certain 
jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offering we may provide.HUMAN CAPITAL
We view our employees and our cu
lture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 9,400 full-time employees located globallyin 59 countries. Of these, 7,600 (81%) we
re located in the United States and Canada, 1,000 (11%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 200 (2%) in Latin Americaand 600 (6%) in Asia-Pacific. 
We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbersfluctuate throughout the y
ear.We believe a crit
ical component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a "Culture Memo" located on our website, is oftendescribed as a high-perf
ormance culture of freedom and responsibility. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives andskills - to work together as a d
ream team. We empower all of our employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decision-making; eachemployee has the freedo
m and power to make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the Company in carrying out their role. In return, our employeesare responsible and accoun
table for those decisions and actions. With this approach, we believe we are a more flexible, fun, stimulating, creative, collaborative andsuccessful organization.
As we have expanded our offices globa
lly, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We have also become mindful of culturaldifferences across and wi
thin regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We employ a teamreporting to our VP of Inclusion Stra
tegy who works to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of havingdiversity and inclusion func
tion as a critical lens through which each Netflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselvesreflected on screen 
- so it’s important that our employees are diverse like the communities we serve. Our Inclusion team helps increase representation by trainingour recruiters on how to hire 
more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resourcegroups (ERGs), representing employe
es and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. Our ERGs are importantin
2

Table of Contentscreating a more inc
lusive environment for all employees, allowing space to connect on shared experiences, providing mentoring, career development andvolunteering opportunities, 
and to provide the Company with insight into the perspectives, needs and lived experiences of the communities. Each ERG is supportedby senior leaders across th
e Company. We published our first Inclusion report in January 2021 which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion.    
We believe in foster
ing great leaders. We employ a VP of Leadership Programs, whose team’s mission is to design programs, such as seminars and lectures,that help our leaders (o
fficers, VPs and director-level employees) examine values that guide them personally, and as leaders, especially when those values comeinto tension with the world around us. The go
al of these programs is to create great human beings, who become great leaders, who shape a great company. We alsoemploy a learning and deve
lopment team that programs workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics, such as leading and inspiringteams. We believe th
is focus helps our employees grow as leaders and well-rounded individuals, and better positions Netflix to operate our global business ofproviding compelling conten
t to entertain the world.    
We aim to pay our employe
es at the top of their personal market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash andstock options. This permits emp
loyee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. In 2020, weconducted a pay equity analys
is and adopted practices to ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid relative to others doing thesame or similar work. We 
also practice “open compensation,” which means the top leaders (director-level and above) at the company can see how much anyemployee is paid. This encour
ages open discussions about pay disparities throughout the Company. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through theseapproaches.
    
We care about the health an
d well-being of our employees and their families. Each employee receives an annual cash health benefit allowance that they mayallocate to medic
al, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. If any portion of the benefit is unused, the employee is paid the unused benefitas cash compensation, up to $5,000. Employ
ees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company matchfor charitable donat
ions. We enhanced a number of these benefits to support our employees through the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.We believe that our app
roach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.OTHER INFORMATION

Risk Factors If any of the following risks ac
tually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of ourcommon stock could decline, and you could 
lose all or part of your investment.Risks Related to Our Business
The ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the global attempt to contain it may harm our 
industry, business, results of operations and ability toraise additional capital.
The global spread of the coron
avirus (COVID-19) and the various attempts to contain it have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economicdisruption. In an effort to 
contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have enacted various measures, some of which have beensubsequently rescinded, modif
ied or reinstated, including orders to close all businesses not deemed “essential,” isolate residents to their homes or places ofresidence, and practi
ce social distancing. We anticipate that these actions and the global health crisis caused by COVID-19, including any resurgences, willcontinue to negatively i
mpact business activity across the globe. In response to government mandates, health care advisories and otherwise responding to employeeand vendor concerns, we have alt
ered certain aspects of our operations. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, our workforce has andcontinues to spend a signific
ant amount of time working from home. International travel has been severely curtailed and many of our productions continue toexperience disruption, as 
are productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partnersthat we use for our operations 
as well as development, production and post-production of content. While we and our partners have resumed productions and relatedoperations in many parts of 
the world, our ability to produce content remains affected by the pandemic. To the extent the resulting economic disruption is severe,we could see some vendors go out of business, 
resulting in supply constraints and increased costs or delays to our productions. Such production pauses may causeus temporarily to have l
ess new content available on our service in subsequent quarters, which could negatively impact consumer demand for and memberretention to our servic
e and the number of paid memberships. Temporary production pauses or permanent shutdowns in production could result in content assetimpairments or other 
charges and will change the timing and amount of cash outflows associated with production activity.The full extent to which the COVID-19 pande
mic and the various responses to it impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend onnumerous evolving factors th
at we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business andindividuals’ actions tha
t have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the availability and cost to access the capital markets; the effect on ourcustomers and customer de
mand for and ability to pay for our services; disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work and travel; and any stoppages,disruptions or increased cos
ts associated with our development, production, post-production, marketing and distribution of original programming. During theCOVID-19 crisis, we may not be able to provid
e the same level of customer service and product features that our members are used to which could negativelyimpact their perception of o
ur service resulting in an increase in cancellations. Furthermore, given increased government expenditures associated with theirCOVID-19 response, we could see increased gove
rnment obligations which could negatively impact our results of operations. If we need to access the capitalmarkets, there can be no
 assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms, if at all. We will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by theCOVID-19 pandemic and may take furth
er actions that alter our business operations, including content production, as may be required by federal, state, local orforeign authorities, or 
that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effectsany such alterations or mod
ifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.The COVID-19 pandemic also led to an inc
rease in our net paid membership additions relative to our quarterly forecast and historic trends in the first half of2020, and slower net paid membersh
ip additions in the second half of 2020 relative to historic trends. These results, as well as those of other metrics such asrevenues, operating marg
ins, net income, net cash provided by operating activities and other financial and operating data, may not be indicative of results for futureperiods. In addition to the pot
ential direct impacts to our business, the global economy is likely to be significantly weakened as a result of the actions taken inresponse to COVID-19. To the extent that such 
a weakened global economy impacts consumers’ ability or willingness to pay for our service or vendors’ ability toprovide services to us, espec
ially those related to our content productions, we could see our business and results of operation negatively impacted.4

Table of ContentsIf our efforts to attract and re
tain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.We have experienced sign
ificant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our abilityto consistently provide our m
embers with compelling content choices, effectively market our service, as well as provide a quality experience for selecting andviewing TV series, documentari
es and feature films. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to ourservice may adversely 
impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, andstreaming enterta
inment providers (including those that provide pirated content), as well as video gaming providers and more broadly other sources ofentertainment tha
t our members could choose in their moments of free time. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if weintroduce new or adjust exist
ing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, wemay not be able to attr
act and retain members. We may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing or our pricing model itself, which may not be well-received by consumers, and which 
may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service. In addition, many of ourmembers rejoin our serv
ice or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful,we may not be able to attr
act members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service formany reasons, including a per
ception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory,competitive services provide
 a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new membershipsboth to replace cance
led memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we permit multiple users within the same householdto share a single account 
for non-commercial purposes, if multi-household usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multi-household usage are ineffective, ourability to add new members 
may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that ourcontent costs are larg
ely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership)revenues commensurate wi
th the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable tosuccessfully compete with 
current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adverselyaffected. Further, if 
excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currentlyanticipate to replace these members
 with new members.Changes in competitive offerings for ent
ertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impactour business.
The market for enter
tainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers haveincreasing options to acc
ess entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported andpiracy-based models. 
All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damageour business, as its fundamenta
l proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light ofthe compelling consumer p
roposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters andcable network operators
, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of thesecompetitors have long oper
ating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketingand other resources. They may s
ecure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology,infrastructure, cont
ent acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings orapproaches to providing ente
rtainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If weare unable to successful
ly or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase ormaintain market share, revenue
s or profitability.We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liabil
ity in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through ourservice.
As a producer and distributor of 
content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the natureand content of materials that
 we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service,including marketing ma
terials. We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming,including TV series
, documentaries and feature films. We believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance ourbrand and otherwise attra
ct and retain members. To the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewingand popularity, our business, includ
ing our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As we expand our original programming, we have becomeresponsible for production cos
ts and5

Table of Contentsother expenses, such as ongoing guild pay
ments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Negotiations or renewalsrelated to entertainment industr
y collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract withthird parties rela
ted to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming.  We may face potential liability or may suffer lossesin connection with these ar
rangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior.To the extent we create 
and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our original programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could becomesubject to product liabilit
y, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to placelicensed or produced conten
t on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by ourmembers, or could be damag
ing to our brand or business.To the extent we do not accura
tely anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removedfrom our service, or if we b
ecome liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims couldbe costly and the expenses and da
mages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnifiedagainst claims or costs o
f these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.
We are expanding our opera
tions internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members andfeatures related 
to our service, scaling our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to operate our DVD service within the U.S. As our internationaloffering evolves, we are m
anaging and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing withe-commerce and str
eaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology andutilizing third-par
ty “cloud” computing services. As we scale our original content production, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, includingcreative, market
ing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. Further, we mayexpand our content offering 
in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges aswell as potential unknown liabi
lities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are notable to manage the growing co
mplexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streamingoperations and original con
tent, our business may be adversely affected.If we fail to maintain or, in newer markets 
establish, a positive reputation concerning our service, including the content we offer, we may not be able toattract or retain membe
rs, and our operating results may be adversely affected.We believe that a positive re
putation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content, in particular, ouroriginal programming, is p
erceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputationmay be adversely impacted.
 To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatoryaction or behavior, includ
ing being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightenedregulatory scrutiny ac
ross our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the extent ourresponse to government act
ion or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establishand maintain a positive 
reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to theextent we are not successfu
l in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.Changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our 
marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected.We utilize a broad m
ix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites, to promote our service and content to existing and potentialnew members. We may limit 
or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned thatmembers or potential members 
deem certain marketing platforms or practices intrusive or damaging to our brand. If the available marketing channels are curtailed,our ability to engage mem
bers and attract new members may be adversely affected.Companies that promote our se
rvice may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that in turn negatively impact us.For example, if they decid
e that they want to compete more directly with us, enter a similar business or exclusively support our competitors, we may no longerhave access to their m
arketing channels. We also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously canceled their membership. If we areunable to maintain or
6

embers with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels and marketing expenses may beadversely affected.
We utilize marke
ting to promote our content and drive conversation about our content and service. To the extent we promote our content or serviceinefficiently or in
effectively, we may not obtain the expected acquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected.We rely upon a number of partners to make our service avai
lable on their devices.We currently offer 
members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players,television set-top boxe
s and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service availablethrough the television set
-top boxes of these service providers, some of whom may have investments in competing streaming content providers. In many instances,our agreements also inc
lude provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connectionwith offering our service. 
If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-servicediscovery interfaces, ou
r service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase ourcapability to stream TV 
series, documentaries and feature films to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing andcreating new relationsh
ips, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to ourmembers via these devi
ces, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.Our agreements with our partn
ers are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, anumber of our partners do not con
tinue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree ofaccessibility and prom
inence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should beresponsible for the devic
es’ performance, the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward Netflix andsuch dissatisfaction could 
result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionalitymay require that par
tners update their devices, or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices. If partners do not updateor otherwise modify their d
evices, or if we discontinue support for certain devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.We are subject to payment processing risk.
Our members pay for our servi
ce using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, onlinewallets and direct ca
rrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of thesepayment methods are su
bject to certain rules and regulations, including additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require paymentof interchange and other 
fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuancesof payment cards, delays in 
receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules or regulations concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/ordisruptions or failures in ou
r payment processing systems, partner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, ourrevenue, operating expenses 
and results of operation could be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and otherpartners to bill subscrib
ers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have totransition subscribers or o
therwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition,from time to time, we 
encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managedcould create negative cons
umer perceptions of our service. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks mayimpose fines, our card
 approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements. The termination of our ability toprocess payments on any major p
ayment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.If government regulations relating to 
the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct ourbusiness, or incur greater operating expenses.
The adoption or modificat
ion of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the mannerin which we currently conduct our bus
iness. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking tointroduce new or extend lega
cy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, recent changes to European lawenables individual memb
er states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction.7

Table of ContentsWe anticipate tha
t several jurisdictions may, over time, impose greater financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the continued growth anddevelopment of the mark
et for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we arerequired to comply with new regu
lations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incuradditional expenses or al
ter our business model.Changes in laws or regulations tha
t adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease thedemand for our service and 
increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal trafficthat traverse thei
r networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent.Furthermore, favorable 
laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed. Given uncertainty aroundthese rules, including chang
ing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local networkoperators, we could experien
ce discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwisenegatively affect ou
r business.Risks Related to Intellectual Property
If studios, content providers or other rights holders r
efuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could beadversely affected.
Our ability to provide our me
mbers with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, includingdistribution rights, to such con
tent and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. Thelicense periods and the t
erms and conditions of such licenses vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide uswith access to certain 
content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or ableto license us content upon te
rms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certainlicenses for content prov
ide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions as wellas other actions we may tak
e, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certainprogramming increase. As we se
ek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including originalcontent. We are also fo
cused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selectiveabout the titles we add and r
enew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adverselyaffected.
Music and certain authors
’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, weengage in negotiations with co
llection management organizations (“CMOs”) that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in connection with streamingcontent into various ter
ritories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or couldbe enjoined from distribu
ting certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiationsbetween certain CMOs and other th
ird parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers representedby certain CMOs unilateral
ly withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure toreach such licensing agr
eements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for thedigital distribution of 
content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other rights holders could expose us to greaterdistribution expenses.
If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequate
ly protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brandand other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affect
ed.We rely and expect to con
tinue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties withwhom we have relationships, as well 
as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforceour proprietary rights th
rough court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications.Nevertheless, these appli
cations may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties mayknowingly or unknowingly infringe our inte
llectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantialexpense to us. If the protec
tion of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content,and other intangible asse
ts may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the8

Table of Contentsperception of our business and se
rvice to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may beadversely affected.
We currently hold various do
main names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect ourreputation and brand and mak
e it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent thirdparties from acquir
ing domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.Intellectual property claims aga
inst us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our website, streamingtechnology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, tit
le selection processes, our content, and marketing activities.Trademark, copyright, pat
ent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to ourtechnology, business processes and th
e content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some ofour content, merchandising ou
r products and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. Ifwe are unable to obtain suff
icient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timelybasis in response to claims 
against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business andcompetitive position may 
be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect manyaspects of our business. There a
re numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patentsrelative to our techno
logy. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, resultsin costly litigation and d
iversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streaming technology, ourrecommendation and me
rchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from ourservice, or remove consum
er products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology,enter into royalty or l
icensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, ifrequired, may be costly or un
available on terms acceptable to us.Risks Related to Information Technology
Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer syste
ms or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including thoserelating to cybersecurity or a
rising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including memberand corporate information, or theft of int
ellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.Our reputation and ability 
to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems andthose of third parties th
at we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverseweather conditions, other na
tural disasters, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions inthese systems, or with the int
ernet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Serviceinterruptions, errors in ou
r software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membershipservice to existing and pot
ential members.Our computer systems and those of 
third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computerviruses, denial of servic
e attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to leadto interruptions and delays 
in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information and other data, confidential information orintellectual prope
rty. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gainaccess to data. Any attemp
t by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets),disrupt our service, or othe
rwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damageour reputation. We have i
mplemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems, but the techniques used to gainunauthorized access to da
ta and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. Because of our prominence,we (and/or third parties
 we use) may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release ofcertain digital con
tent assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is noassurance that hackers 
may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions orunauthorized access. Effo
rts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain.These efforts require ongo
ing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts9

easures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Anysignificant disruption to ou
r service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation.Further, a penetration of ou
r systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business,regulatory, litigat
ion and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We utilize our own communi
cations and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we utilizethird-party “cloud” co
mputing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help usstream TV series, document
aries and feature films in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party “cloud” computingor other network providers, inc
luding technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adverselyimpact the experien
ce of our members.We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate cer
tain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon WebServices operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.
Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) prov
ides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a"cloud" computing service. W
e have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other servicesprovided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast m
ajority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operationsto another cloud provider, any d
isruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.While the retail s
ide of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantageagainst our service, al
though if it was to do so it could harm our business.If the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not opera
te to expectations, our business and results of operation could beadversely impacted.
We utilize a combin
ation of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed torecommend and merchand
ise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumerelectronic devices. For 
example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do notinterconnect with our CDN or charge us 
to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN’s operation, our ability to efficiently and effectivelydeliver our streaming 
content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if ourrecommendation and me
rchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retainmembers may be adverse
ly affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the dailyoperations of our business. If our 
technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of“bugs” in our development and dep
loyment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Anyharm to our members’ pe
rsonal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations and financia
l condition.Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across the
ir networks could adversely impact our business.We rely upon the ability o
f consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our serviceover their networks, our servi
ce and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, includingmeaningful bandwidth caps, or oth
erwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and ourmembership acquisition an
d retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and eithercharge us for or prohibit us f
rom being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.Most network operators that prov
ide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such,many network operators have an 
incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe thatconsumer demand, regulato
ry oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferentialtreatment to thei
r data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. Theextent to which these
 incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.10

Table of ContentsRisks Related to Privacy
Privacy concerns could limit our abili
ty to collect and leverage member personal information and other data and disclosure of member personalinformation and other data could adversely impact our business and reputation.
In the ordinary course of busin
ess and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members, we collect andutilize information supplied
 by our members, which may include personal information and other data. We currently face certain regulatory requirements regardingthe manner in which we trea
t such information, including but not limited to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Priva
cy Act ("CCPA"). Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA, other data privacy laws orregulations, or relat
ed contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings bygovernmental entiti
es and private parties, damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputationand market position.
Other businesses have been cri
ticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to datacollected on the inte
rnet regarding users’ browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings underexisting laws that limi
t our ability to collect, transfer and use information and other data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were todisclose information and o
ther data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and wecould face potential legal claims
 that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legalobligations concerning our t
reatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export.Failure to comply with these ob
ligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to theseobligations, we could incur addi
tional expenses.Our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if membe
r personal information and other data, particularly billing data, were to beaccessed by unauthorized persons.
We maintain personal 
information and other data regarding our members, including names and billing information. This information and data is maintainedon our own systems as well as that of th
ird parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing information, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryptionand authentication te
chnology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and otherdata. Despite these measu
res we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusioninto our members’ infor
mation and other data. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to usnecessary for them to remain
 or become members. We also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach (including various stateAttorneys General, one or more EU da
ta protection authorities, or other data protection authorities) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incidentwithin strict time pe
riods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could bematerial, and we curr
ently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain personal information and other data concerning ouremployees, as well as persona
l information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ personalinformation and other da
ta and/or production personal information occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to dataprotection could be negat
ively impacted.Risks Related to Liquidity
The long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our 
content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity andresults of operations.
In connection with licensing s
treaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter intomulti-year commi
tments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent
 agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixedcost”) but may be deter
mined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extentestimable under accoun
ting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations" and Note 7, 
Commitments and Contingencies  in the accompanying notes to ou r consolidated financial statements included inPart II, Item 8, "Financia
l Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed costnature of content comm
itments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Payment terms forcertain content commitments, s
uch as content we directly produce, will typically11

Table of Contentsrequire more up-front 
cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the extentmembership and/or revenu
e growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of contentcommitments and accelerated payment
 requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limitour flexibility in plann
ing for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is notfavorably received by consu
mers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-termand fixed cost nature of our 
content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adverselyimpacted.
We may seek additional capital that may result 
in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.From time to time, we may s
eek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. For several years prior to 2020, our cashflows from operations were neg
ative and to the extent that it becomes negative in the future we may need to seek additional capital. The decision to obtainadditional capital wi
ll depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Any disruption in the capitalmarkets could make it 
more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through theissuance of equity, equity-
linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and ourstockholders may experien
ce dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obliga
tions, which could adversely affect our financialposition.
We have a substantial a
mount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we may incur additionalindebtedness in the future 
and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. If the financial markets become difficult or costly toaccess, our ability to r
aise additional capital may be negatively impacted. As of December 31, 2020, we had the equivalent of $16.4 billion aggregate principalamount of senior notes outstand
ing (“Notes”), some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolvingcredit agreement 
that provides for a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, we have not borrowed any amount under thisrevolving credit fac
ility. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $7.0 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet,some of which is denominated in 
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteriafor liability recogn
ition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidatedbalance sheet, see Note 7, 
Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to ou r consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,"Financial Statements and Suppl
ementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streamingcontent obligations, may:
•
make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our otherobligations;
•
limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;•
increase our cost of borrowing;•
limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general businesspurposes;
•
require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;•
limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;•
place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and•
increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.Our streaming obligations in
clude large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in ourcash flows from operations by r
educing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at anunfavorable time, which m
ay negatively impact our stock price.12

Table of ContentsThe interest rate of bo
rrowings under our revolving credit agreement makes reference to an adjusted London interbank offered rate ("LIBO Rate"). It ispossible that beginning in 2022, the L
IBO Rate will be discontinued as a reference rate. Under our revolving credit agreement, in the event of the discontinuance ofthe LIBO Rate, a mutually agre
ed-upon alternate benchmark rate will be established to replace the LIBO Rate.  In the event that an agreement cannot be reachedon an appropriate benchma
rk rate, the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement could be adversely impacted.We may not be able to generate suffici
ent cash to service our debt and other obligations.Our ability to make paymen
ts on our debt, including our Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which issubject to prevailing e
conomic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. For several years prior to 2020,our cash flows from operations we
re negative. We may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay theprincipal, premium, i
f any, and interest on our debt, including the Notes, and other obligations, including amounts due under our streaming content obligations.If we are unable to servi
ce our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior tomaturity. Our ability to 
refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition atsuch time. Any refinancing or 
restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could furtherrestrict our business oper
ations. If our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any ofthese obligations on comme
rcially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations, or financia
l condition.If our cash flows are insuff
icient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations, we could facesubstantial liquidity prob
lems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debtand other obligations. We c
annot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that theproceeds from such alte
rnatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations when due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternativemeasures, our business, results o
f operations, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Risks Related to International Operations
We could be subject to economic, politica
l, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.Operating in international
 markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and otherrisks that may be diffe
rent from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks thatcould adversely affec
t our business, including:•
the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;•
difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;•
political or social unrest and economic instability;•
compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economicsanctions, and local laws prohib
iting corrupt payments to government officials;•
difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions, including local ownership requirements forstreaming content provid
ers;•
regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatoryrequirements or otherwis
e, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction;•
foreign intellectual property laws, such as the EU copyright directive, or changes to such laws, which may be less favorable than U.S. law and, amongother issues, may impact
 the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual propertyrights;
•
adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment indetermining our global 
provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination isuncertain;

implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and preserve local culture andeconomic activity, in
cluding local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support local film funds. For example, the European Unionrevised its Audio Visual Media Serv
ices Directive in 2018 to require that European works comprise at least thirty (30) percent of media serviceproviders’ catalogs, and to 
require prominence of those works.Our failure to manage any o
f these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.We are subject to taxation relat
ed risks in multiple jurisdictions.We are a U.S.-based multina
tional company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining ourglobal provision for income 
taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions areconsistent with the tax laws in 
the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional taxauthorities, which may have 
a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes.Tax laws are being re-exa
mined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in thequarter or year that 
they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies and we have tax audits pending in severaljurisdictions. Many U.S. states, count
ries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development, ar
e actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we dobusiness. If U.S. or other foreign tax 
authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results ofoperations may be adverse
ly impacted.Risks Related to Human Resources
We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire quali
fied employees.We rely on the continued se
rvice of our senior management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos, members of ourexecutive team and oth
er key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product develop
ment, technical, creative and other personnel. If we experience high executive turnover, are not successful in recruiting newpersonnel or in retaining 
and motivating existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or improving our culture as we grow, our operations may bedisrupted.
Labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.
Our partners, suppliers, vendors and we 
employ the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent as well as trade employees and others who aresubject to collectiv
e bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may berenewed on terms that ar
e unfavorable to us. If expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, then it is possible that the affected unions could takeaction in the form of st
rikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective bargainingagreements or a signif
icant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production, added costs or by reducing profit margins.14

Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Stock Ownership
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that s
tockholders may consider favorable.Our charter documents may d
iscourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:•
authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;•
provide for a classified board of directors;•
prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent;•
establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and•
prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders.As a Delaware corporation, we ar
e also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in abusiness combination with any holde
r of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board ofdirectors has approved the 
transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.In addition, a merger or 
acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated ExecutiveSeverance and Retention Inc
entive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.Our stock price is volatile.
The price at which our common s
tock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including thefollowing, some of which are beyond our 
control:•
variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income, net cash provided byoperating activiti
es and free cash flow;•
variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;•
announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;•
competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;•
market volatility in general;•
the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;•
the impact of any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;•
the operating results of our competitors; and•
other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.As a result of these and other 
factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.Following certain peri
ods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more suchlitigation following futu
re periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.Preparing and forecasting our financial results r
equires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results. Given the dynamic nature of ou
r business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income andnumber of paid membershi
p additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could cause a decline inthe trading price of our 
common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generallyaccepted in the United 
States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,disclosures of contingent ass
ets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reportedperiods. We base such estim
ates on historical experience and on various other15

Table of Contentsassumptions that we
 believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the contentamortization patt
ern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based uponvarious factors includin
g historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortizationwould be changed and could affec
t the timing or recognition of content amortization. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period expenses,which could cause us to miss our ea
rnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price.General Risk Factors
We are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unfores
een expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's timeand attention.
From time to time, we ar
e subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, wehave seen a rise in the numb
er of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringementclaims, tax litiga
tion, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigationdisputes could cause us to incur un
foreseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of ourmanagement's time and 
attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiriesand subpoenas and other types of info
rmation requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to ourbusiness activities. While
 the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matterscan be expensive, time-
consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of ourbusiness practices, reput
ational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.Item 1B.

ear ended December 31, 2020 increased 24% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in ourconsolidated revenues was due to 
the 24% growth in average paying memberships and a 1% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. Theincrease in average 
monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreignexchange rates. Paid net m
embership additions for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 31% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as a resultof the long term trend towa
rd streaming on demand entertainment and due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting social restrictions and local governmentmandates of home confineme
nt in certain jurisdictions.The increase in operat
ing margin is due primarily to increased revenues and decreased marketing costs, coupled with cost of revenues, technology anddevelopment, and general 
and administrative costs growing at a slower rate as compared to the 24% increase in revenues.The full extent of the i
mpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that wemay not be able to accur
ately predict. See Item 1A: "Risk Factors" section set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. In an effort toprotect the health and s
afety of our employees, our workforce has had and continues in most instances to spend a significant amount of time working from home,international trav
el has been severely curtailed and many of our productions continue to experience disruption, as are the productions of our third-party contentsuppliers. Our other partners h
ave similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development,production, and post-production of 
content. While we and our partners have resumed productions and related operations in many parts of the world, our ability toproduce content remains 
affected by the pandemic. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have also enacted variousmeasures, some of which have be
en subsequently rescinded, modified or reinstated, including orders to close all businesses not deemed “essential,” isolateresidents to their homes o
r places of residence, and practice social distancing. We anticipate that these actions and the global health crisis caused by COVID-19,including any resurgences, wil
l continue to negatively impact business activity across the globe. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may takefurther actions that 
alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests ofour employees, customers,

We derive revenues from mo

ies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31, 2020, pricing on our plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2to $24 per month. We expect th

t currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership. In order to excludethe effect of fore
ign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchangerates had remained cons
tant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2020,our revenues would have been approxi
mately $596 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year endedDecember 31, 2019.
Cost of Revenues
Amortization of content 
assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content (suchas payroll and related p
ersonnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneousproduction related costs 
and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We havebuilt our own global content del
ivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Deliveryexpenses, therefore, inc
lude equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computingcosts, associated with deliv
ering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay toour integrated payment p
artners, as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members.

ia enacted legislative changes that impose an annual cap of $5 million on the amount of business incentive tax credits wecan utilize in Califo
rnia effective for tax years 2020 through 2022. As a result, we evaluated our ability to realize the California R&D credit, and considered allavailable positive and n
egative evidence, including operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income and determined it is more likelythan not that the pre-2020 c
redits and a portion of the current year R&D credit would not be realized. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we recordeda valuation allowance of $250 
million. We will monitor our business strategies, weighing positive and negative evidence in assessing the realization of this asset inthe future and in the even
t there is a need to release the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded.The increase in our eff
ective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily due to theestablishment of a valu

edit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt  in the accompanying notes to ou r consolidated financial statements.As our cash provided by operating ac
tivities improved in 2020, we anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limitedcompared to prior years. Our 
ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, ourdevelopment efforts, busin
ess plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtainsuch financing on terms ac
ceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights,preferences or privi
leges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.As our cash provided by operating ac
tivities grows and exceeds our minimum cash needs, our future capital allocation may include stock repurchaseprograms. The timing and magn
itude of such programs will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans and operating performance.Our primary uses of cash includ
e the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs.Cash payment terms for non-or
iginal content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular contentthat we produce and own, require mo
re cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advanceof when the content is avail
able on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content, particularly inoriginal content, which will 
impact our liquidity. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources,including our revolving cred
it facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months.Free Cash Flow
We define free cash 
flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. We believefree cash flow is an impor
tant liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations,make strategic acqu
isitions and investments and for certain other activities like share repurchases. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure andshould not be considered in isola
tion of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities, or any othermeasure of financia
l performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.In assessing liquidity in re
lation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major recurring differences are excesscontent payments over amo
rtization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on our euro-denominated debt, and otherworking capital differences
. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, taxes and semi-annual interest paymen
ts on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly.27

As of December 31, 2020, content obliga tions were comprised of $4.4 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $2.6 billion of "Non-currentcontent liabiliti
es" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $12.2 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they didnot then meet the cri
teria for recognition.Content obligations include a
mounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. An obligation for the production of content includesnon-cancelable commitments un
der creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisitionand licensing of conte
nt is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability isrecorded on the Consolidated Bal
ance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantityand/or fees for which are no
t yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where thenumber of seasons to be aired 
is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include anyestimated obligation 
for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknownobligations are expect
ed to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the paymentsfor the vast majority o
f such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgmentsand the actual amounts m
ay differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligationstable above.

Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt  in the accompanying notes to ou r consolidated financialstatements included in Pa

tions as of December 31, 2020 increased $82 million from $2,757 million as of December 31, 2019 to $2,839 million as ofDecember 31, 2020 due to growth in fac
ilities to support our growing headcount and growing number of original productions.(4)
Other purchase obligati ons include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. These contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery and cloudcomputing costs, as well as othe
r miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods.As of December 31, 2020, we had gross unrecogniz
ed tax benefits of $140 million, of which $38 million was classified in “Other non-current liabilities” and$54 million as a reduction 
to deferred tax assets which was classified as "Other non-current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate ofthe range of reasonably possib
le adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have transactions wi
th unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we havefinancial guarantees, sub
ordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks,contingent liabilit
ies, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risksupport to us.

The preparation of con
solidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requiresmanagement to make es
timates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dateof the financial sta
tements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") hasdefined a company’s cri
tical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations,and which require a company to 
make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies andjudgments addressed below. We bas
e our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under thecircumstances. Actual result
s may differ from these estimates.Content
We acquire, license 
and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. Thecontent licenses are 
for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require moreupfront cash payments rel
ative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, areclassified within "Net cash p
rovided by (used in) operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.We recognize content 
assets (licensed and produced) as "Content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the feeper title and record 
a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title isaccepted and availab
le for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs andproduction overhead. Partic
ipations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.Based on factors including histo
rical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on theConsolidated Statements of Oper
ations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with themonth of first availab
ility. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandisingand marketing efforts, an
d film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset isexpected to be amortized 
within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regularbasis. Our estimates rel
ated to these factors require considerable management judgment.Our business model is subscription bas
ed as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) arepredominantly monetiz
ed as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expectedusefulness of the content or 
that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. Ifsuch changes are identif
ied in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costsfor assets that have been, o
r are expected to be, abandoned are written off.Income Taxes
We record a provision for 
income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.Deferred income taxes are reco
gnized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carryingamounts of existing assets and 
liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assetsand liabilities of a 
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, ifnecessary, by a valuation a
llowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.Although we believe our assumptions, judg
ments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of anytax audits could signific
antly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.In evaluating our abili
ty to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our pastoperating results, and our fo
recast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent30

Table of Contentsand feasible tax planning s
trategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plansand estimates we are using 
to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments andestimates. However, we believ
e that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately berealized. We reco
rd a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. As ofDecember 31, 2020 the valuation 
allowance of $250 million was related to the California research and development credits that we do not expect to realize.We did not recognize ce
rtain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it ismore likely than not the 
tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefitsrecognized in the finan
cial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realizedupon settlement. At Decembe
r 31, 2020, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $140 million of which $86 million, if recognized, would favorablyimpact our future ea
rnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may changeand the actual tax benefits
 may differ significantly from the estimates.See Note 10 to the consolidated f
inancial statements for further information regarding income taxes.Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Ma rket RiskWe are exposed to marke
t risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currencyfluctuations.
Interest Rate Risk
At December 31, 2020, our cash equival
ents were generally invested in money market funds. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailinginterest rate.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $16.4 billion of deb
t, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in sixteen tranches due between 2021 and 2030. Refer to Note6 to the consolidated finan
cial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing inperiods of declining rat
es of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes inforeign currency rat
es, as discussed below.Foreign Currency Risk
Revenues denominated in curr
encies other than the U.S. dollar account for 54% of the consolidated amount for the year ended December 31, 2020. Wetherefore have fore
ign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, theMexican peso, the Australian do
llar, and the Japanese yen.Accordingly, changes in exchange 
rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue andoperating income as expr
essed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues would have been approximately $596 million higher hadforeign currency exchang
e rates remained constant with those for the year ended December 31, 2019.We have also experienc
ed and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurementof monetary assets and li
abilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a$660 million foreign exchang
e loss primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, coupled with the remeasurement ofcash and content liabil
ity positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.In addition, the effec
t of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December 31, 2020 was an increase of $36 million.We do not use foreign exchange 
contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factorsthat we cannot forecast wi
th reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result suchfluctuations could have a s
ignificant impact on our future results of operations.31

Controls and Procedures (a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the par
ticipation of our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosurecontrols and procedures (as d
efined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K. Based on that evaluation, our co
-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end ofthe period covered by this Annual Repo
rt on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reportsthat we file or submit unde
r the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and ExchangeCommission’s rules and forms, and 
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers andChief Financial Officer, 
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.Our management, including our 
co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or ourinternal controls will p
revent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance that the obje
ctives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and thebenefits of controls must b
e considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provideabsolute assurance that 
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Netflix, 
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - IntegratedFramework issued by the Committe
e of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix,Inc. (the Company) mainta
ined, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balancesheets of the Company as of Decemb
er 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cashflows for each of the thre
e years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated January 28, 2021 expressed an unqualifiedopinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s mana
gement is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financia
l reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company’s int
ernal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare required to be indep
endent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commiss
ion and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in a

fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over F
inancial ReportingA company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of Netflix, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidatedstatements of operat
ions, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and therelated notes (collectively referred t
o as the “consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all materialrespects, the financi
al position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in theperiod ended December 31, 2020, in con
formity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 28, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Adoption of ASU No. 2016-02
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidat
ed financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption ofAccounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, 
Leases (Topic 842) , and the related amend ments.Basis for Opinion
These financial stat
ements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statementsbased on our audits. We are a pub
lic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securit
ies laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater
ial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included exam
ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles u
sed and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated
 below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to becommunicated to the audit c
ommittee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especiallychallenging, subjective o
r complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financialstatements, taken as a whol
e, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on theaccounts or disclosures to which 
it relates.40

Table of ContentsContent Amortization
Description of the Matter
As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolida ted financial statements “Organization and Summary of SignificantAccounting Policies”, the Company a
cquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming(“Content”). The Company amort
izes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortizat
ion of the Company’s Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature ofamortization which is bas
ed on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based onhistorical and forec
asted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period ofamortization would be chang
ed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.How We Addressed the 
Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over thecontent amortizat
ion process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the content amortizationmethod and the significan
t assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used todevelop estimated viewing p
atterns. We also tested management’s controls to determine that the data used in themodel was complete and ac
curate. To test content amorti
zation, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortizationmethod, testing the signif
icant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing thecompleteness and accur
acy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management’s assumptions bycomparing them to curr
ent viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimatesof viewing patterns to actu
al results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in thecontent amortizat
ion recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.
Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business
Netflix, Inc. (the “Company”
) was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is one of the world’s leadingentertainment serv
ices with approximately 204 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a widevariety of genres and langu
ages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause andresume watching, all without 
commercials. Additionally, the Company continues to offer its DVD-by-mail service in the United States ("U.S.").Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financi
al statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions havebeen eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolid
ated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of Americarequires management to make e
stimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities atthe date of the financ
ial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimatesand assumptions include the con
tent asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases itsestimates on historic
al experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, theCompany evaluates these assump
tions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting St
andards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)
, in order to improve finan cial reporting of expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit. ASU 2016-13 requires that an entit
y measure and recognize expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost and replaces the incurred loss impairmentmethodology in prior GAAP with a methodology tha
t requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate credit losses. The Company adoptedASU 2016-13 in the first quarter of 2020 and 
the impact of the adoption was not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements as credit losses arenot expected to be signifi
cant based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of payment partners, and external market factors.Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, 
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740). ASU 2019-12 removes certain except ions forperforming intraperiod tax all
ocations, recognizing deferred taxes for investments, and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The guidance also simplifiesthe accounting for fran
chise taxes, transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, and the effect of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in interimperiods. ASU 2019-12 is effective for 
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. While the Company is continuing to assessthe potential impac
ts of ASU 2019-12, it does not expect ASU 2019-12 to have a material effect, if any, on its financial statements.Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments 
in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company alsoclassifies amounts in tran
sit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.Content
The Company acquires, licenses 
and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment.The content licenses ar
e for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability.47

Table of ContentsPayment terms for cer
tain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments forcontent, including additions 
to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities" on theConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The Company recognizes content 
assets (licensed and produced) as “Content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, theCompany capitalizes the 
fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title isknown and the title is accep
ted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, includingdevelopment costs, direc
t costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.Based on factors including histo
rical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost ofrevenues” on the Consolidated Sta
tements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years,beginning with the month of firs
t availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, for instance dueto additional merchandisin
g and marketing efforts and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed orproduced content asset is exp
ected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortizationof the content assets on an ongoing b
asis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.The Company's business model is subscript
ion based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed andproduced) are predominan
tly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates achange in the expected use
fulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event orchanges in circumstanc
es. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value.In addition, unamortized 
costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.Property and Equipment
Property and equipme
nt are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of theestimated useful liv
es of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.Trade Receivables
Trade receivables cons
ist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company's behalf. TheCompany evaluates the need fo
r an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, andexternal market factors.
Marketing

Table of ContentsIncome Taxes
The Company records a provision for 
income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liabilitymethod. Deferred income ta
xes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statementcarrying amounts of exist
ing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferredtax assets and liabili
ties of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets isreduced, if necessary, by a v
aluation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.The Company did not recognize ce
rtain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a taxbenefit only if it is mo
re likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.The tax benefits recogni
zed in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood ofbeing realized upon sett
lement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 to theconsolidated financial statement
s for further information regarding income taxes.Foreign Currency
The functional currency 
for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. TheCompany translates the asse
ts and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end ofeach period. Revenues and expenses 
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from thesetranslations are re
cognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in Stockholders’ equity on theConsolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company remeasure
s monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of eachperiod. Gains and losses from thes
e remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of $660million, a gain of $7 mil
lion, and a loss of $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These gains and losses were primarilydue to the non-cash remeasu
rement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated incurrencies other than 
functional currencies.Stock-Based Compensation
The Company grants fully vested non-qu
alified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-basedcompensation expense is ful
ly recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. See Note 9 to the consolidated financialstatements for furth
er information regarding stock-based compensation.2.
Revenue Recognition The Company's primary source of r
evenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership andrevenues are recognized ratabl
y over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted togovernmental authorit
ies. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs,provide access to the serv
ice as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. Typically, payments made to the partners, such as for marketing,are expensed. However, if ther
e is no distinct service provided in exchange for the payments made to the partners or if the price that the member pays is establishedby the partners and there 
is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as a reduction of revenues.The following tables summar

Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is 
computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings pershare is computed using the weigh
ted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during theperiod. Potential common sha
res consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share is asfollows:

Table of ContentsLeases
The
 Company has entered into operating leases primarily for real estate. These leases generally have terms which range from 1 year to 15 years, and ofteninclude
 one  or  more  options  to  renew.  These  renewal  terms  can  extend  the  lease  term  from  1  year  to  20  years,  and  are  included  in  the  lease  term  when  it  isreasonably
 certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating leases are included in "Other non-current assets" on the Company's ConsolidatedBalance
 Sheets, and represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company’s obligations to make lease payments are includedin
 "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Operating lease right-of-use assetsand
 liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company has entered into variousshort-term
 operating leases, primarily for marketing billboards, with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company'sConsolidated
 Balance Sheets. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For the year ended December 31, 2020, theCompany
 recognized approximately $441 million in total lease costs, which was comprised of $324 million in operating lease costs for right-of-use assets and$117
 million  in  short-term  lease  costs  related  to  short-term  operating  leases.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2019,  the  Company  recognized  approximately$448
 million in total lease costs, which was comprised of $218 million in operating lease costs for right-of-use assets and $230 million in short-term lease costsrelated to short-te
rm operating leases.Prior
 to the adoption of ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the leaseterm.
 The  Company  used  the  date  of  initial  possession  to  begin  amortization,  which  is  generally  when  the  Company  entered  the  space  and  began  to  makeimprovements
 in preparation for intended use. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other thanthe
 date of initial occupancy, the Company recorded minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statementsof Operations. Rent expense associ
ated with operating leases was $107 million  for the year ended Decemb er 31, 2018.Because
 the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of thelease
 payments. The Company has certain contracts for real estate and marketing which may contain lease and non-lease components which it has elected to treatas a single lease componen

ate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company's and its subsidiaries assets, to anotherperson. As of December 31, 2020 and Decembe
r 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.Revolving Credit Facility
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has a $750 mi
llion unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Agreement”), which matures on March 29,2024. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repa
id and reborrowed until March 29, 2024, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may usethe proceeds of future bor
rowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2020, noamounts have been borrowed under th
e Revolving Credit Agreement.The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agr
eement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate equal to a base rate (the “AlternateBase Rate”) or (ii) a r
ate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate (the “Adjusted LIBO Rate”), plus a margin of 0.75%. The Alternate Base Rate isdefined as the greatest of
 (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate,plus 0.500% and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a on
e-month interest period, plus 1.00%. The Adjusted LIBO Rate is defined as the London interbank offered ratefor deposits in U.S. dollars, for the 
relevant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, but in no event shall the Adjusted LIBO Rate be lessthan 0.00% per annum. Regulatory au
thorities that oversee financial markets have announced that after the end of 2021, they would no longer compel bankscurrently reporting in
formation used to set the LIBO Rate to continue to make rate submissions. As a result, it is possible that beginning in 2022, the LIBO Ratewill no longer be availabl
e as a reference rate. Under the terms of the Company's Revolving Credit Agreement, in the event of the discontinuance of the LIBORate, a mutually agreed
-upon alternate benchmark rate will be established to replace the LIBO Rate. The Company and Lenders shall in good faith establish analternate benchma
rk rate which places the Lenders and the Company in the same economic position that existed immediately prior to the discontinuation of theLIBO Rate. The Company does not anticipat
e that the discontinuance of the LIBO Rate will materially impact its liquidity or financial position.The Company is also obligated to pay 
a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at an annual rate of 0.10%. TheRevolving Credit Agreement requ
ires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company’ssubsidiaries to incur debt

Content obligations include a
mounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies aretranslated to the U.S. dollar 
at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent andemployment agreemen
ts as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time theCompany enters into an agree
ment to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certainagreements include th
e obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reportingdate. Traditional fi
lm output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such licenseagreements. The Company does not in
clude any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknownobligations are expect
ed to be significant.Legal Proceedings
From time to time, in th
e normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employeerelations, business pract
ices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complexlegal proceedings are d
ifficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. TheCompany expenses legal fees as 
incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and theamount of the loss can be re
asonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operationsor its financial posit
ion, liquidity or results of operations.The Company is involved in litiga
tion matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at thistime. The Company's view of the ma
tters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.8.
Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations In the ordinary course of busin
ess, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varyingscope and terms to business par
tners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach ofsuch agreements and o
ut of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other partymaking a claim pursuant t
o the procedures specified in the particular contract.The Company’s obligations under thes
e agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourseagainst third parties 
for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers thatwill require it, among oth
er things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The termsof such obligations vary.
It is not possible to make a 
reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to theconditional nature of th
e Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in theaccompanying consolidate
d financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.58

c value of the Company's outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2020 was $6,922 million and represents the total pretaxintrinsic value (the d
ifference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2020 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been 
received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of 2020. This amountchanges based on the fair m
arket value of the Company’s common stock. Total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019and 2018 was $1,596 million, $666 million and $863 
million, respectively. The weighted-average remaining contractual term of the Company's outstanding stockoptions as of December 31, 2020 includ
ed in the table above was 5.55 years.Cash received from option ex
ercises for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $235 million, $72 million and $125 million, respectively.59

actors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated option exercise behavior.The Company calculates expe
cted volatility based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in itscommon stock is more ref
lective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicatorof expected volatili
ty than historical volatility of its common stock.In valuing shares issued under th
e Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-couponissues with terms simila
r to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and thereforeuses an expected dividend yie
ld of zero in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upongrant date.

ifornia enacted legislative changes that impose an annual cap of $5 million on the amount of business incentive taxcredits we can utiliz
e in California effective for tax years 2020 through 2022. As a result, we evaluated the Company's ability to realize the California R&D credit,the Company considered all av
ailable positive and negative evidence, including operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income anddetermined it is mor
e likely than not that the pre-2020 credits and a portion of the current year R&D credit would not be realized. In the twelve months endedDecember 31, 2020, the Company has reco
rded a valuation allowance of $250 million. The Company will monitor its business strategies, weighing positive andnegative evidence in ass
essing its realization of this asset in the future and in the event there is a need to release the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will berecorded.

ty to realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including its past operating resultsand the forecast of futu
re market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2020,the valuation allowance o
f $250 million was related to the California R&D credits that the Company does not expect to realize.As of December 31, 2020, the Company's Federal R&D t
ax credit and state tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes were $317 million, and $365million, respective
ly. The Federal R&D tax credit carryforwards expire through 2040. State tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely.In the fourth quarter of 2020, 
the Company determined that the likelihood of utilizing its non-U.S. foreign tax credits of $135 million for which there was avaluation allowance of $135 m
illion was remote given its recent global corporate simplification. As such, the Company has written off the deferred tax assetagainst the valuation a
llowance and will no longer disclose these amounts.The unrecognized tax 
benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as “Other non-current liabilities”and a reduction of defer
red tax assets which is classified as "Other non-current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the totalamount of gross unrecognized t
ax benefits was $140 million, of which $86 million, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate. Asof December 31, 2019, the total 
amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $67 million, of which $57 million, if recognized, would favorably impact theCompany’s effective tax 
rate. The aggregate changes in the Company’s total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized as follows (in thousands):62

and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in “Other non-current liabilities”in the Consolidated Balance Shee
ts. Interest and penalties included in the Company's provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.The Company files U.S. Federal, state 
and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for 2016 through 2018 and is subjectto examination for 2019. The 2015 th
rough 2019 state tax returns are subject to examination by various state tax authorities. The Company is also currently underexamination in the UK for 2018 and 2019. The 
company has no other significant foreign jurisdiction audits underway. The years 2014 through 2019 generallyremain subject to exa
mination by foreign tax authorities.Given the potential outcom
e of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute oflimitations, it is r
easonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimateof the range of reasonably poss
ible adjustments cannot be made at this time.11.    Employee Benefit Plan
The Company maintains a 401(k) sav
ings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 80% of their annualsalary through payroll deduc
tions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at thediscretion of the Board. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, 
the Company’s matching contributions totaled $69 million, $47 million and $27 million, respectively.Multiemployer Benefit Plans
The Company contributes to various 
multiemployer defined pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. Th
e risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer plans such that (i) contributions made by theCompany to the multiemploye
r pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stopparticipating in the 
multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan; and (iii) if theCompany stops contributing to the mu
ltiemployer pension plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the obligation of the remaining participatingemployers. The Company also contr
ibutes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare benefits to both active and retiredparticipants. The Company does not p
articipate in any multiemployer benefit plans that are individually significant to the Company.The following table summar
izes the Company's contributions to multiemployer pension and health plans for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and2018, respectively:

EXHIBIT 10.11NETFLIX, INC. 2011 STOCK PLAN
GLOBAL MONTHLY-GRANT STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT
Unless specifically indicated in this Global Monthly-Grant Stock Option Agreement, including any addendum
attached hereto (“Addendum”) containing country-specific terms and conditions (collectively, this “Agreement”), the terms
defined in the 2011 Stock Plan (the “Plan”) will have the same defined meanings in this Agreement.
I.
NOTICE OF STOCK OPTION GRANT From time to time during your employment with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, you (also known as the
“Optionee”) may be granted Options to purchase Common Stock of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Plan and this Agreement. Upon each grant, the number of Shares granted, the date of grant, and the exercise price per share (the
“Exercise Price”) shall be communicated to you by the Company. All Options granted to you pursuant to this Agreement shall
be vested upon grant and treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options (“NSOs”). At present, the Company grants options on the first
trading day of each month in accordance with the Company’s disclosed stock option formulae. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Company retains the right to change the terms of this Agreement for any grants that are made to you after
announcement of the changed terms, including the timing of grants, the disclosed stock option formulae or any inputs thereto.
You acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement constitutes an express or implied promise of continued grants, or
benefits in lieu of grants, even if grants have been made in the past; it being expressly understood that grants to employees are,
at all times, made in the sole and absolute discretion of the Administrator.
Vesting Schedule
: Options granted under this Agreement shall be vested immediately upon grant.
Termination Period
: In no event may Options granted hereunder be exercised later than the ten-year anniversary of the date of grant (the
Option’s “Term”).
II.
AGREEMENT A.
Grant of Option . All Options granted to you hereunder by the Administrator are subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan,
which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, but not by way of limitation, the Plan contains important provisions
regarding termination and expiration of Options in the event of a Change in Control of the Company. Notwithstanding any
contrary provision of this Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail.

EXHIBIT 10.11B.
Nature of Grant . In accepting the Options, you acknowledge, understand and agree that:
1.
the  Plan  is  established  voluntarily  by  the  Company,  is  discretionary  in  nature,  and  may  be  amended,suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan;
2.
you are voluntarily participating in the Plan; 3.
unless you do allocate a portion of your salary towards the acquisition of the Options (to the extent permitted by the Company and by applicable laws), the Options and any Shares acquired thereunder, and the income from
and value of same, are not intended to replace any compensation owed to you by the Company or, if different, your
employer (the "Employer");
4.
regardless of whether you allocate salary toward the acquisition of Options, the Options and any Shares acquired thereunder, and the income from and value of same, are not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of
calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service
awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments;
5.
the future value of the Shares underlying the Options is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty;
6.
if the underlying Shares do not increase in value, the Options will have no value; 7.
if you exercise the Options and acquire Shares, the value of such Shares may increase or decrease in value, even below the Exercise Price;
8.
no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Options; 9.
unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Options and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Options or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed
by, another company nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting
the Shares;
10.
unless otherwise agreed with the Company, the Options and any Shares acquired thereunder, and the income from and value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service you may provide as a
director of a Subsidiary; and
11.
if you provide services outside the U.S., i.
where  applicable, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be liable for any foreignexchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States

EXHIBIT 10.11Dollar
 that may affect the number and value of the Options or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the exercise of the Optionsor the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon exercise; and
ii.
regardless of whether you allocate salary toward the acquisition of Options, the Options and any Shares acquired thereunder, and the income from and value of same, are not part of normal or expected compensation for any
purpose.
C.
Exercise of Option . 1.
Right to Exercise . An Option granted hereunder is exercisable during the applicable Option’s Term in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Agreement.
2.
Method of Exercise . An Option granted hereunder is exercisable by delivery of an exercise notice, in the form of exercise notice found on the Company’s intranet site or as otherwise available from the Company (the “Exercise
Notice”), which shall state the election to exercise an Option, the number of Shares in respect of which such Option is being
exercised (the “Exercised Shares”), the date of grant of such Option, and such other representations and agreements as may be
required by the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. The Exercise Notice shall be properly completed by Optionee
and delivered to the Stock Plan Administrator of the Company (or his or her designee). The Exercise Notice shall be
accompanied by payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as to all Exercised Shares. An Option shall be deemed to be exercised
upon receipt by the Company of such fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by such aggregate Exercise Price.
The Company will not be required to issue any certificate or certificates for Shares hereunder prior to fulfillment of all
the following conditions: (a) the admission of such Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which such class of stock i
s thenlisted; (b) the completion of any registration or other qualification of such Shares under any U.S. or non-U.S. state or federal law
or under the rulings or regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or any other regulatory body,
which the Administrator, in its absolute discretion, deems necessary or advisable (c) the obtaining of any approval or other
clearance from any U.S. or non-U.S. governmental agency, which the Administrator, in its absolute discretion, determines to be
necessary or advisable; and (d) the lapse of such reasonable period of time following the date of exercise as the Administrator
may establish from time to time for reasons of administrative convenience. Optionee understands that the Company is under no
obligation to register or qualify the Common Stock with the SEC or any other U.S. or non-U.S. state or federal securities
commission or to seek approval or clearance from any governmental authority for the issuance or sale of the Shares. Further,
Optionee agrees that the Company shall have unilateral authority to amend the Plan and the Agreement without Optionee’s
consent to the extent necessary to comply with securities or other laws applicable to the issuance of Shares.
Assuming such compliance, for tax purposes the Exercised Shares shall be considered transferred to Optionee on the
date the applicable Option is exercised with respect to such Exercised Shares.
D.
Method of Payment . 
EXHIBIT 10.11Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be by any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of
Optionee, unless otherwise provided in the Addendum:
1.
cash; 2.
check; 3.
consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan; or
4.
for U.S. taxpayers only, surrender of other Shares which (i) in the case of Shares acquired from the Company, have been owned by Optionee for more than six (6) months on the date of surrender, and (ii) have a Fair Market
Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Exercised Shares.
E.
Non-Transferability of Option . Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Option granted hereunder may not be sold, pledged, assigned,
hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be
exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee. If the Administrator makes an Option transferable, such Option
will contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate. Unless otherwise determined by the
Administrator, the Optionee may, subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator deems advisable, assign or transfer all or
part of vested Options during an Optionee’s lifetime to (a) Optionee’s spouse, former spouse or dependent pursuant to a court-
approved domestic relations order that relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments or marital property rights, or (b)
trust or other similar estate planning entity that is solely for the benefit of the Optionee and/or the Optionee’s immediate family. In
such case, the transferee shall receive and hold the Options subject to the provisions of this section, and there shall be no further
assignation or transfer of the Options. The terms of the Plan and this Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators,
heirs, successors and assigns of Optionee.
F.
Tax Consequences and Responsibilities . Optionee acknowledges that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or the Employer, the ultimate liability for
all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to
Optionee’s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Optionee (“Tax-Related Items”) is and remains Optionee’s
responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. Optionee further acknowledges
that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related
Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option,
the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to
and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate Optionee’s
liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Optionee is subject to Tax-Related Items in more
than one jurisdiction, Optionee acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may
be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

EXHIBIT 10.11Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Optionee agrees to make adequate arrangements
satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, Optionee authorizes the
Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard
to all Tax-Related Items by withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired at exercise of the Options either through a
voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Optionee’s behalf pursuant to this authorization
without further consent).
The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering maximum applicable rates, in which case
Optionee may receive a cash refund of any over-withheld amount not remitted to tax authorities on Optionee’s behalf and will
have no entitlement to the Shares equivalent.
Finally, Optionee agrees to pay to the Company or the Employer, including through withholding from Optionee’s wages
or other cash compensation paid to Optionee by the Company and/or the Employer, any amount of Tax-Related Items that the
Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of Optionee’s participation in the Plan that
cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds
of the sale of Shares, if Optionee fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
G.
Rights as a Stockholder . Neither you nor any person claiming under or through you shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of
the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares shall have
been issued (which may occur electronically), recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and
delivered to Optionee. After such issuance, recordation and delivery, you will have all the rights of a stockholder of the
Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.
H.
Address for Notices . Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Agreement shall be addressed to the Company at Netflix,
Inc., Attention: Employee Services, 100 Winchester Circle, Los Gatos, CA 95032 (streamingemployeeservices@netflix.com),
or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing.
I.
Administrator Authority . The Administrator shall have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the
administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules.
All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Administrator in good faith shall be final and binding
upon you, the Company and all other interested persons. The Administrator shall not be personally liable for any action,
determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Agreement.
J.
Electronic Delivery and Acceptance . 
EXHIBIT 10.11The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to Options awarded under the Plan or
future Options that may be awarded under the Plan by electronic means or request Optionee’s consent to participate in the Plan
by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan
through any online or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.
K.
Entire Agreement . The Plan is incorporated herein by reference. The Plan, this Agreement and any incidental grant or enrollment
documents, including any addendum and appendix attached thereto, constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all other prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and
Optionee with respect to the subject matter hereof.
L.
Venue . For purposes of any action, lawsuit or other proceedings brought to enforce this Agreement, relating to it, or arising
from it, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Santa Clara County,
California, or the federal courts for the United States for the Northern District of California, and no other courts, where this
grant is made and/or to be performed.
M.
No Guarantee of Continued Service . The transactions contemplated hereunder do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as a
Service Provider for the term of the Option, or any period at all, and shall not interfere with your right or the right of the
Employer to terminate your relationship as a Service Provider at any time, with or without cause.
N.
No Advice Regarding Grant . The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations
regarding Optionee’s participation in the Plan, or Optionee’s acquisition or sale of the Shares. Optionee should consult with his
or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding his or her participation in the Plan before taking any action
related to the Plan.
O.
Language . Optionee acknowledges that he or she is proficient in the English language and understands the content of this
Agreement and other Plan-related materials. If Optionee has received this Agreement, or any other document related to the
Options and/or the Plan translated into a language other than English and if the meaning of the translated version is different
than the English version, the English version will control.
P.
Severability . 
EXHIBIT 10.11The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or
otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
Q.
Addendum . Notwithstanding any provisions in this Global Monthly-Grant Stock Option Agreement, the Option grant shall be subject
to any special terms and conditions set forth in any Addendum to this Global Monthly-Grant Stock Option Agreement for
Optionee’s country. Moreover, if Optionee transfers employment or relocates to one of the countries included in any
Addendum, the special
terms and
 conditions for such country will apply to Optionee, to the extent the Company determines that the application of suchterms and conditions is necessary or
 advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Addendum constitutes part of this GlobalMonthly-Grant Stock Option Agreement.
R.
Imposition of Other Requirements . The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Optionee’s participation in the Plan, on the Options
and on any Shares purchased upon exercise of the Options, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for
legal or administrative reasons, and to require Optionee to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary
to accomplish the foregoing.
S.
Waiver . Optionee acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or
be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by Optionee or any other
optionees.
T.
Insider Trading Restrictions/Market Abuse Laws . Optionee acknowledges that he or she is subject to the Netflix, Inc. Insider Trading Policy and that Optionee has
reviewed and agreed to this policy. Further, Optionee acknowledges that, depending on his or her country, broker’s country, or
the country in which the Shares are listed, he or she may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws in
applicable jurisdictions, which may affect his or her ability to accept, acquire, sell or attempt to sell, or other dispose of the
Shares, rights to Shares, or rights linked to the value of Shares, during such times as Optionee is considered to have “inside
information” regarding the Company (as defined by the laws or regulations in applicable jurisdictions, including the U.S. and
Optionee’s country). Local insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders Optionee
placed before possessing inside information. Furthermore, Optionee may be prohibited from (i) disclosing insider information
to any third party, including fellow employees (other than on a “need to know” basis) and (ii) “tipping” third parties or causing
them to otherwise buy or sell securities. Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to
any restrictions that may be imposed under the Netflix, Inc. Insider Trading Policy. Optionee acknowledges that it is Optionee’s
responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and Optionee should speak to his or her personal advisor on this
matter.

EXHIBIT 10.11U.
Foreign Asset and Account Reporting . Optionee’s country may have certain exchange control and/or foreign asset/account reporting requirements which may
affect Optionee’s ability to acquire or hold Shares under the Plan or cash received from participating in the Plan (including from
any dividends received or sale proceeds resulting from the sale of Shares) in a brokerage or bank account outside of Optionee’s
country. Optionee may be required to report such accounts, assets or transactions to the tax or other authorities in Optionee’s
country. Optionee also may be required to repatriate sale proceeds or other funds received as a result of Optionee’s participation
in the Plan to his or her country through a designated bank or broker and/or within a certain time after receipt. Optionee
acknowledges that it is Optionee’s responsibility to comply with any applicable regulations, and that Optionee should speak to
Optionee’s personal advisor on this matter.
***
The Options granted hereunder are granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement. By
accepting this Option, (1) you confirm that you have reviewed the Plan and this Agreement in their entirety, have had an
opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing this Agreement and fully understand all provisions of the Plan and
Agreement, and (2) you agree to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the Administrator upon
any questions relating to the Plan and Agreement. You must promptly notify the Company in writing (including electronically)
of any change in your residence address.

C.
Exercise of Option . 1.
Right to Exercise . An Option granted hereunder is exercisable during the applicable Option’s Term in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Agreement.
2.
Method of Exercise . An Option granted hereunder is exercisable by delivery of an exercise notice, in the form of exercise notice found on the Company’s intranet site or as otherwise available from the Company (the “Exercise Notice”),
which shall state the election to exercise an Option, the number of Shares in respect of which such Option is being exercised (the
“Exercised Shares”), the date of grant of such Option, and such other representations and agreements as may be required by the
Company pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. The Exercise Notice shall be properly completed by Optionee and delivered to
the Stock Plan Administrator of the Company (or his or her designee). The Exercise Notice shall be accompanied by payment of
the aggregate Exercise Price as to all Exercised Shares. An Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company
of such fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by such aggregate Exercise Price.
The Company will not be required to issue any certificate or certificates for Shares hereunder prior to fulfillment of all the
following conditions: (a) the admission of such Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which such class of stock i
s thenlisted; (b) the completion of any registration or other qualification of such Shares under any U.S. or non-U.S. state or federal law
or under the rulings or regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or any other regulatory body,
which the Administrator, in its absolute discretion, deems necessary or advisable; (c) the obtaining of any approval or other
clearance from any U.S. or non-U.S. governmental agency, which the Administrator, in its absolute discretion, determines to be
necessary or advisable; and (d) the lapse of such reasonable period of time following the date of exercise as the Administrator
may establish from time to time for reasons of administrative convenience. Optionee understands that the Company is under no
obligation to register or qualify the Common Stock with the SEC or any other U.S. or non-U.S. state or federal securities
commission or to seek approval or clearance from any governmental authority for the issuance or sale of the Shares. Further,
Optionee agrees that the Company shall have
3

EXHIBIT 10.12unilateral authority to amend the Plan and the Agreement without Optionee’s consent to the extent necessary to comply with
securities or other laws applicable to the issuance of Shares.
Assuming such compliance, for tax purposes the Exercised Shares shall be considered transferred to Optionee on the date
the applicable Option is exercised with respect to such Exercised Shares.
D.
Method of Payment . Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be by any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of
Optionee, unless otherwise provided in the Addendum:
1.
cash; 2.
check; 3.
consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan, including, without limitation, a net exercise program to the extent permitted by the Company and by
applicable laws, whereby Shares are held back to cover the Exercise Price; or
4.
for U.S. taxpayers only, surrender of other Shares which (i) in the case of Shares acquired from the Company, have been owned by Optionee for more than six (6) months on the date of surrender, and (ii) have a Fair Market
Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Exercised Shares.
E.
Non-Transferability of Option . Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Option granted hereunder may not be sold, pledged, assigned,
hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be
exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee. If the Administrator makes an Option transferable, such Option
will contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate. Unless otherwise determined by the
Administrator, the Optionee may, subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator deems advisable, assign or transfer all or
part of vested Options during an Optionee’s lifetime to (a) Optionee’s spouse, former spouse or dependent pursuant to a court-
approved domestic relations order that relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments or marital property rights, or (b)
trust or other similar estate planning entity that is solely for the benefit of the Optionee and/or the Optionee’s immediate family. In
such case, the transferee shall receive and hold the Options subject to the provisions of this section, and there shall be no further
assignation or transfer of the Options. The terms of the Plan and this Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators,
heirs, successors and assigns of Optionee.
F.
Tax Consequences and Responsibilities . 4

EXHIBIT 10.12Optionee acknowledges that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or the Employer, the ultimate liability for all
income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to Optionee’s
participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Optionee (“Tax-Related Items”) is and remains Optionee’s responsibility and
may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. Optionee further acknowledges that the
Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in
connection with any aspect of the Option, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the
subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to and are
under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate Optionee’s liability for
Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Optionee is subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one
jurisdiction, Optionee acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required
to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Optionee agrees to make adequate arrangements
satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax- Related Items. In this regard, Optionee authorizes the
Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to
all Tax-Related Items by (i) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon exercise of the Option arranged by the
Company (on Optionee’s behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent), (ii) withholding from Optionee’s wages or
other cash compensation payable to Optionee by the Company and/or a Parent or Subsidiary, (iii) withholding Shares to be issued
upon exercise of the Option and otherwise deliverable to Optionee, including, without limitation, a net exercise program whereby
Shares are held back, or (v) any other method of withholding determined by the Company and, to the extent required by
applicable laws or the Plan, approved by the Committee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Optionee is an officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (a
“Section 16 Officer”), then the Company will withhold Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option in order to satisfy the
minimum statutory amount required to be withheld pursuant to the Tax-Related Items with respect to such Section 16 Officer in
accordance with method (iii) above, unless the use of such withholding method is impermissible or impracticable under applicable
laws, in which case the withholding obligation will be satisfied by method (ii) above, provided that, in the event the Section 16
Officer has elected to satisfy the Tax-Related Items through method (i) as permitted hereunder or has previously elected a Section
16 Officer Withholding Amount (as defined below) greater than the applicable minimum statutory amount required to be withheld
pursuant to the Tax-Related Items, the Company shall give effect to such election(s). The “Section 16 Officer Withholding
Amount” in respect of any issuance of Shares pursuant hereto means the (i) applicable minimum statutory amount required to be
withheld pursuant to the Tax-Related Items, or (ii) such greater amount, up to the sum of all applicable maximum rates, applied in
respect of the applicable issuance of Shares with respect to the Section 16 Officer at such Section 16 Officer’s election.
5

EXHIBIT 10.12The Company and/or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding
rates or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in Optionee’s jurisdiction(s), except as provided above for
Section 16 Officers. If Tax-Related Items are withheld at a rate which exceeds Optionee's obligation for Tax-Related Items,
Optionee may receive a cash refund of any over-withheld amount not remitted to tax authorities on Optionee’s behalf and will
have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent, or if not refunded, Optionee may seek a refund from the local tax
authorities. In the event Tax- Related Items are withheld at a rate which is less than Optionee’s obligations for Tax-Related
Items, Optionee may be required to pay any additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or to the
Company and/or the Employer. If the obligation for Tax- Related Items is satisfied by withholding Shares, for tax purposes,
Optionee shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the exercised Option, notwithstanding that a
number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
Finally, Optionee agrees to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax- Related Items that the Company or
the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of Optionee’s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied
by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if
Optionee fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax- Related Items.
G.
Rights as a Stockholder . Neither Optionee nor any person claiming under or through Optionee shall have any of the rights or privileges of a
stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such
Shares shall have been issued (which may occur electronically), recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents
or registrars, and delivered to Optionee. After such issuance, recordation and delivery, Optionee will have all the rights of a
stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.

M.
No Guarantee of Continued Service . The transactions contemplated hereunder do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as a
Service Provider for the term of the Option, or any period at all, and shall not interfere with Optionee’s right or the right of the
Employer to terminate Optionee’s relationship as a Service Provider at any time, with or without cause.
N.
No Advice Regarding Grant . The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations
regarding Optionee’s participation in the Plan, or Optionee’s acquisition or sale of the Shares. Optionee should consult with his or

R.
Imposition of Other Requirements . The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Optionee’s participation in the Plan, on the Options and
on any Shares purchased upon exercise of the Options, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal
or administrative reasons, and to require Optionee to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to
accomplish the foregoing.
S.
