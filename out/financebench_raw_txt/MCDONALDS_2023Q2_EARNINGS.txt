4 THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS APPLY TO THESE TERMS AS USED THROUGHOUT THIS RELEASE  
Constant currency  results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at 
prior year average exchange rates. Managemen t reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, 
impairment and other charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation 
plans on these results becau se the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.  
Comparable sales and comparable guest counts  are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales and 
transactions, respectively, at all restaurants, whether operat ed by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months 
including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, 
rebuilding, road construction, natural disasters, pandemics and acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities. Restaurants in Russia were treated 
as permanently closed as of April 1, 2022 and therefore excluded from the calculation of comparable sales and comparable gues t counts 
beginning in the second quarter of 2022. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market 
considered hyperinflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three -year period exceeds 
100%), which management be lieves more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, 
McDonald's excluded results from Argentina and Lebanon in the calculation of comparable sales due to hyperinflation (V enezuel a 
continues to be excluded) . Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by 
changes in pricing and product mix.  
Systemwide sales  include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. This i ncludes sales from 
digital channels, which are comprised of the mobile app, delivery and kiosk at both Company- operated and franchised restaurants. While 
franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is i mportant in understanding the 
Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and 
are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consis t of sales by Company- operated restaurants and 
fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Sys temwide 
sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expan sion.   
Free cash flow , defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free 
cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert net profits 
into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.
