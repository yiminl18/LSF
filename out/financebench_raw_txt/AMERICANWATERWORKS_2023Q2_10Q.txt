American Water Works Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
(Unless otherwise noted, in millions, except per share data)
Note 1: Basis of Presentation
The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report include the accounts of American Water Works Company, Inc. and all of its
subsidiaries (the “Company” or “American Water”), in which a controlling interest is maintained after the elimination of intercompany balances and
transactions. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for
interim financial reporting, and the rules and regulations for reporting on Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”). Accordingly, they do not contain
certain information and disclosures required by GAAP for comprehensive financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a
fair statement of the financial position as of June 30, 2023, and the results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented, have been made. All
adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature, except as otherwise disclosed.
The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (“Form 10-K”), which provides a more complete discussion of the Company’s accounting policies, financial
position, operating results and other matters. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
the year, primarily due to the seasonality of the Company’s operations.
Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies
New Accounting Standards
Presented in the table below are new accounting standards that were adopted by the Company in 2023:
Standard  Description  Date of
Adoption  Application  Effect on the Consolidated
Financial Statements
Accounting for Contract Assets
and Contract Liabilities from
Contracts with CustomersThe guidance requires an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and
contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, as if it had originated the contracts.
The amendments in this update also provide certain practical expedients for
acquirers when recognizing and measuring acquired contract assets and contract
liabilities from revenue contracts in a business combination.January 1,
2023Prospective This standard did not have a
material impact on the
Consolidated Financial
Statements
Troubled Debt Restructurings
and Vintage DisclosuresThe main provisions of this standard eliminate the receivables accounting guidance

The New Jersey Economic Development Authority (“NJEDA”) determined that the Company was qualified to receive $161 million in tax credits in
connection with its capital investment in its corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. The Company was qualified to receive the tax credits over a 10-
year period commencing in 2019.
In March 2023, the NJEDA issued the utilization certificate for the 2020 tax credits to the Company in the amount of $16 million. The Company sold
these tax credits to external parties in March 2023 for $15 million. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had $32 million and $48 million,
respectively, in Other current assets and $97 million in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a result of these tax credits. The Company
has made the necessary annual filing for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.

Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
Allowances for uncollectible accounts are maintained for estimated probable losses resulting from the Company’s inability to collect receivables from
customers. Accounts that are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. A number of factors are considered in determining the
allowance for uncollectible accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due, previous loss history, current economic and societal conditions and
reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of receivables from customers. The Company generally writes off accounts when they become
uncollectible or are over a certain number of days outstanding.
Presented in the table below are the changes in the allowance for uncollectible accounts for the six months ended June 30:

On June 29, 2023, the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) issued a decision on the cost of capital application for the Company’s
California subsidiary, which authorizes a return on equity of 8.98% and a capital structure with an equity component of 57.04% for the three-year period from
2022 to 2024. The CPUC’s decision is not retroactive and will be effective from the date of the order through the end of 2024. The decision includes a Water
Cost of Capital Mechanism (the “WCCM”) that would allow the California subsidiary to increase its return on equity for the remainder of 2023 and 2024 based
on capital market rates. As authorized by the WCCM, on June 30, 2023, the California subsidiary filed with the CPUC staff an advice letter to seek a 52 basis
point increase to the return on equity for 2023, which was approved on July 25, 2023, increasing the return on equity to 9.50%, effective July 31, 2023.

On May 3, 2023, the Missouri Public Service Commission issued an order approving the March 3, 2023, joint settlement agreement in the general rate
case filed on July 1, 2022, by the Company’s Missouri subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $44 million annualized increase in water and
wastewater revenues, excluding $51 million in previously approved infrastructure surcharges, and authorized implementation of the new water and wastewater
rates effective May 28, 2023. The annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by significant incremental capital investments since the Missouri subsidiary’s
2021 rate case order. The Missouri subsidiary’s view of its rate base is $2.3 billion, and its view as to its return on equity and long-term debt ratio (each of
which is based on the general rate case order but was not disclosed therein) is 9.75% and 50.0%, respectively.
On April 24, 2023, the Virginia State Corporation Commission issued an order approving the settlement of the rate case filed on September 26, 2022, by
the Company’s Virginia subsidiary. The general rate case order approved an $11 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues. Interim rates in
this proceeding were effective on May 1, 2022, and the order requires that the difference between interim and the final approved rates is subject to refund
within 90 days of the order issuance. The order approves the settlement terms with a return on equity of 9.7% and a common equity ratio of 40.7%. The
annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by significant incremental capital investments since the Virginia subsidiary’s 2020 rate case order that have
been completed or were planned through April 30, 2023, increases in pension and other postretirement benefits expense and increases in production costs,
including chemicals, fuel and power costs. The general rate case order includes recovery of the Virginia subsidiary’s COVID-19 deferral balance. It also
includes approval of the accounting deferral of deviations in pension and other postretirement benefits expense from those established in base rates, until the
Virginia subsidiary’s next base rate case.
On December 8, 2022, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission issued an order approving the joint settlement agreement in the rate case filed on
April 29, 2022, by the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $138 million annualized increase in water and wastewater
revenues, excluding $24 million for previously approved infrastructure filings, and authorizes implementation of the new water and wastewater rates effective
January 28, 2023. The annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by significant incremental capital investments since the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s 2021
rate case order that will be completed through December 31, 2023, increases in pension and other postretirement benefits expense and increases in production
costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. The general rate case order also includes recovery of the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s COVID-19 deferral
balance. The Pennsylvania subsidiary’s view of its rate base is $5.1 billion, and its view as to its return on equity and long-term debt ratio (each of which is
based on the general rate case order but was not disclosed therein) is 10.0% and 44.8%, respectively.
On December 15, 2022, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case filed on
February 10, 2022, by the Company’s Illinois subsidiary. As updated in the Illinois subsidiary’s June 29, 2022 rebuttal filing, the request sought $83 million in
additional annualized revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges. The general rate case order approved a $67 million annualized
increase in water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $18 million, effective January 1, 2023, based on
an authorized return on equity of 9.78%, authorized rate base of $1.64 billion, a common equity ratio of 49.0% and a debt ratio of 51.0%. The annualized
revenue increase is being driven primarily by significant water and wastewater system capital investments since the Illinois subsidiary’s 2017 rate case order
that have been completed or are planned through December 31, 2023, expected higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and increases in
production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs.
Pending General Rate Case Filings
On June 30, 2023, the Company’s Kentucky subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $26 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding
infrastructure surcharges of $10 million. An order is expected in the general rate case by the end of the first quarter of 2024.
On May 1, 2023, the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $45 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding
previously approved infrastructure surcharges of $7 million. The general rate case includes a future test year capturing planned investment through 2025 and an
order is expected to be reached by February 25, 2024. On June 30, 2023, the West Virginia subsidiary filed its annual infrastructure surcharge requesting $8
million in additional annualized revenues for planned investment through 2024. The infrastructure surcharge will be aligned with the investments recognized in
the general rate case if the future test year is approved.
On March 31, 2023, the Company’s Indiana subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $87 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding $41
million of revenue from infrastructure filings already approved, which includes three step increases, with $43 million of the increase to be included in rates in
January 2024, $18 million in May 2024, and $26 million in May 2025. An order is expected in the general rate case by the end of January 2024.

Table of Contents
On July 1, 2022, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting an increase in 2024 revenue of $56 million and a total increase
in revenue over the 2024 to 2026 period of $95 million, all as compared to 2022 revenues. The Company updated its filing in January 2023 to capture the
authorized step increase effective January 1, 2023. The filing was also updated to incorporate a decoupling proposal and a revision to the Company’s sales and
associated variable expense forecast. The revised filing requested additional annualized revenues for the test year 2024 of $37 million, compared to 2023
revenues. This excludes the proposed step rate and attrition rate increase for 2025 and 2026 of $20 million and $19 million, respectively. The total revenue
requirement request for the three-year rate case cycle, incorporating updates to present rate revenues and forecasted demand, is $76 million.
Infrastructure Surcharges
A number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and
investments, such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure. Presented in the table
below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant water sales volume and customer count, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations
that became effective during 2023:

(a) In 2023, $1 million was effective June 29 and $16 million was effective April 29.
(b) In 2023, $20 million was effective March 23 and $6 million was effective March 8.
Pending Infrastructure Surcharge Filings
On March 1, 2023, the Company’s Kentucky subsidiary filed an infrastructure surcharge proceeding requesting $4 million in additional annualized
revenues. An order is expected in this proceeding in the third quarter of 2023. The infrastructure surcharge will reset to zero once the pending general rate case
becomes effective which is expected by the end of the first quarter of 2024.
Other Regulatory Matters
In September 2020, the CPUC released a decision under its Low-Income Rate Payer Assistance program rulemaking that required the Company’s
California subsidiary to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which would become
effective in January 2024. On October 5, 2020, the Company’s California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the decision and following the
CPUC’s denial of its rehearing application in September 2021, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a petition for writ of review with the California
Supreme Court on October 27, 2021. On May 18, 2022, the California Supreme Court issued a writ of review for the California subsidiary’s petition and the
petitions filed by other entities challenging the decision. Independent of the judicial challenge, California passed Senate Bill 1469, which allows the CPUC to
consider and authorize the implementation of a mechanism that separates the water corporation’s revenue and its water sales. Legislation was signed by the
Governor on September 30, 2022, and became effective on January 1, 2023. In response to the legislation, on January 27, 2023, the Company’s California
subsidiary filed an updated application requesting the CPUC to consider a Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism in its pending 2022
general rate case, which would be effective 2024 through 2026.
On March 2, 2021, an administrative law judge (“ALJ”) in the Office of Administrative Law of New Jersey filed an initial decision with the New Jersey
Board of Public Utilities (“NJBPU”) that recommended denial of a petition filed by the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary, which sought approval of
acquisition adjustments in rate base of $29 million associated with the acquisitions of Shorelands Water Company, Inc. in 2017 and the Borough of
Haddonfield’s water and wastewater systems in 2015. On July 29, 2021, the NJBPU issued an order adopting the ALJ’s initial decision without modification.
The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary filed a Notice of Appeal with the New Jersey Appellate Division on September 10, 2021. The Company’s New Jersey
subsidiary filed its brief in support of the appeal on March 4, 2022. Response and Reply briefs were filed on June 22, 2022, and August 4, 2022, respectively.
Oral argument was held on March 22, 2023, and the Company expects a decision by the end of 2023. There is no financial impact to the Company as a result of
the NJBPU’s order, since the acquisition adjustments are currently recorded as goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Contract Balances
Contract assets and contract liabilities are the result of timing differences between revenue recognition, billings and cash collections. In the Company’s
Military Services Group (“MSG”), certain contracts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals
or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Contract assets are recorded when billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition and are reclassified to
accounts receivable when billed and the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities are recorded when the Company receives advances
from customers prior to satisfying contractual performance obligations, particularly for construction contracts, and are recognized as revenue when the
associated performance obligations are satisfied.
Contract assets of $111 million and $86 million are included in unbilled revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively. Contract liabilities of $71 million and $91 million are included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Revenues recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, from amounts included in
contract liabilities were $68 million and $65 million, respectively.

Table of Contents
Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations (“RPOs”) represent revenues the Company expects to recognize in the future from contracts that are in progress.
The Company enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and other customers.
As of June 30, 2023, the Company’s operation and maintenance (“O&M”) and capital improvement contracts in the MSG and the Contract Services Group
have RPOs. Contracts with the U.S. government for work on various military installations expire between 2051 and 2073 and have RPOs of $7.0 billion as of
June 30, 2023, as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue. Such contracts are subject to customary termination provisions held by the U.S.
government, prior to the agreed-upon contract expiration. Contracts with municipalities and commercial customers expire between 2026 and 2038 and have
RPOs of $578 million as of June 30, 2023, as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue. Some of the Company’s long-term contracts to operate and
maintain the federal government’s, a municipality’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain
maintenance for some of those facilities, in exchange for an annual fee. Unless specifically required to perform certain maintenance activities, the maintenance
costs are recognized when the maintenance is performed.
Note 5: Acquisitions and Divestitures
Regulated Businesses
Closed Acquisitions
During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company closed on ten acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems for a total
aggregate purchase price of $35 million, which added approximately 7,100 water and wastewater customers. This includes the Company’s New Jersey
subsidiary’s acquisition of the water and wastewater assets of Egg Harbor City on June 1, 2023, for a cash purchase price of $22 million, $2 million of which
was funded as a deposit to the seller in March 2021 in connection with the execution of the acquisition agreement. The Egg Harbor City acquisition was
accounted for as a business combination and the assets acquired consisted primarily of $22 million of utility plant.
Pending Acquisitions
On April 6, 2023, the Company’s Illinois subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of the wastewater treatment plant from the City of
Granite City for $83 million, subject to adjustment as provided for in the asset purchase agreement. This system provides wastewater service for approximately
26,000 customer connections. The Company now expects to close this acquisition by the end of 2023, pending regulatory approval.
Effective March 24, 2023, the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary acquired the rights to buy the wastewater system assets of the Township of
Towamencin, for an aggregate purchase price of $104 million, subject to adjustment as provided in the asset purchase agreement. This system provides
wastewater services to approximately 6,300 customer connections in seven townships in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The Company expects to close
this acquisition by mid-year 2024, pending regulatory approval.
On October 11, 2022, the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the wastewater assets of the Butler Area Sewer
Authority for a total purchase price of $232 million in cash, subject to adjustment as provided for in the asset purchase agreement. This system provides
wastewater service for approximately 14,700 customer connections. The Company expects to close this acquisition by the end of 2023, pending regulatory
approval.
Note 6: Shareholders’ Equity
Common Stock Offering
On March 3, 2023, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 12,650,000 shares of its common stock. Upon closing of
this offering, the Company received, after deduction of the underwriting discount and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately
$1,688 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to repay short-term commercial paper obligations of American Water Capital Corp.
(“AWCC”), the wholly owned finance subsidiary of American Water, and for general corporate purposes.

The Company does not reclassify the amortization of defined benefit pension cost components from accumulated other comprehensive loss directly to
net income in its entirety, as a portion of these costs have been deferred as a regulatory asset. These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are
included in the computation of net periodic pension cost.
The amortization of the gain (loss) on cash flow hedges is reclassified to net income during the period incurred and is included in interest, net in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
An unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale fixed-income securities is reclassified to net income upon sale of the securities as a realized gain or loss
and is included in Other, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Dividends
On June 1, 2023, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.7075 per share to shareholders of record as of May 9, 2023.
On July 26, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.7075 per share, payable on September 1, 2023, to
shareholders of record as of August 8, 2023. Future dividends, when and as declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors, will be dependent upon future
earnings and cash flows, compliance with various regulatory, financial and legal requirements, and other factors. See Note 9—Shareholders’ Equity in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Form 10-K for additional information regarding the payment of dividends on the Company’s
common stock.
Note 7: Long-Term Debt
On June 29, 2023, AWCC, issued $1,035 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”). AWCC
received net proceeds of approximately $1,022 million, after deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deduction of offering expenses
payable by AWCC. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations and the remainder is being used for general
corporate purposes. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of AWCC and have the benefit of a support agreement from parent company, which serves as
the functional equivalent of a guarantee by parent company of the obligations of AWCC under the Notes. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2026 (the
“Maturity Date”), unless earlier exchanged or repurchased.
19
Table of Contents
The Notes will be exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of 5.8213 shares of parent company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes
(equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $171.78 per share of common stock). The initial exchange rate of the Notes is subject to adjustment as
provided in the indenture pursuant to which the Notes were issued (the “Note Indenture”). Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately
preceding March 15, 2026, the Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain
periods described in the Note Indenture. On or after March 15, 2026, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date,
the Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders at any time regardless of these conditions or periods. Upon any exchange of the Notes, AWCC
will (1) pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and (2) pay or deliver (or cause to be delivered), as the case may be, cash, shares of parent
company's common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of such common stock, at AWCC's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of AWCC’s
exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being exchanged.
AWCC may not redeem the Notes prior to the Maturity Date, and no sinking fund is provided for the Notes. Subject to certain conditions, holders of the
Notes will have the right to require AWCC to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as defined in the Note
Indenture, at a repurchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
In addition to the Notes issued by AWCC as described above, during the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company’s regulated subsidiaries issued in
the aggregate $125 million of private activity bonds and government funded debt in multiple transactions with annual interest rates ranging from 0.00% to
3.75%, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.30%, maturing in 2025 through 2041. The private activity bonds and government funded debt issued by the
Company's regulated subsidiaries during the six months ended June 30, 2023, were collateralized. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, AWCC and the
Company’s regulated subsidiaries made sinking fund payments for, or repaid at maturity, $170 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding long-term
debt, with annual interest rates ranging from 0.00% to 6.55%, a weighted average interest rate of 1.63%, and maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2051.
The Company had entered into eleven 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $300 million. The Company designated these
treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. In June 2023, the Company
terminated the treasury lock agreements realizing a net gain of $3 million included in Other, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
No ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 or 2022.
Note 8: Short-Term Debt
Liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments are generally funded through cash flows from operations,
public and private debt offerings, commercial paper markets and, if and to the extent necessary, borrowings under the AWCC revolving credit facility and
issuances of equity. The revolving credit facility provides $2.75 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of financial institutions. The
termination date of the credit agreement with respect to AWCC’s revolving credit facility is October 2027. The revolving credit facility is used principally to
support AWCC’s commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support and to provide a sub-limit of up to $150 million for letters of credit. As of
June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were
$75 million and $78 million, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility.
At June 30, 2023, there was no outstanding short-term debt as the proceeds of the Notes were used to repay the short-term commercial paper obligations.
See Note 7—Long-Term Debt for additional information relating to the Notes.
At December 31, 2022, short-term debt consisting of commercial paper borrowings totaled $1,177 million, or net of discount $1,175 million. The
weighted-average interest rate on AWCC’s outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 4.41% and there were no commercial paper borrowings
outstanding with maturities greater than three months.

Note 9: Income Taxes
The Company’s effective income tax rate was 21.6% and 19.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 21.2% and 18.8%
for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in the Company’s effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2023, was primarily due to the decrease in the amortization of EADIT pursuant to regulatory orders. The amortization of EADIT is generally offset
with reduction in revenue.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA contains a Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax
(“CAMT”) provision, effective January 1, 2023. To determine if a company is considered an applicable corporation subject to CAMT, the company’s average
adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) for the three consecutive years preceding the tax year must exceed $1 billion. An applicable corporation must
make several adjustments to net income when determining AFSI. The Company evaluated the potential impacts of the CAMT provision within the IRA and
believes it does not exceed the $1 billion AFSI threshold, and therefore, is not currently subject to CAMT in 2023. The Company is continuing to assess the
impact of the initial guidance regarding the application of the CAMT and will continue to monitor as additional guidance is released.

2022, respectively. The Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $22 million during the remainder of 2023.
There were no contributions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, and $3 million and $13 million of contributions for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, for the funding of the Company’s other postretirement benefit plans.
Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies
Contingencies
The Company is routinely involved in legal actions incident to the normal conduct of its business. As of June 30, 2023, the Company has accrued
approximately $6 million of probable loss contingencies and has estimated that the maximum amount of losses associated with reasonably possible loss
contingencies that can be reasonably estimated is $3 million. For certain matters, claims and actions, the Company is unable to estimate possible losses. The
Company believes that damages or settlements, if any, recovered by plaintiffs in such matters, claims or actions, other than as described in this Note 11—
Commitments and Contingencies, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Dunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation
On the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of
the West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar, West Virginia and owned by the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary (“WVAWC”). The failure
of the main caused water outages and low pressure for up to approximately 25,000 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews
completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26, 2015, a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to
approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20% by the next morning. The second repair showed signs of leaking, but
the water main was usable until June 29, 2015, to allow tanks to refill. The system was reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000
customers while a final repair was being completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully restored by July 1, 2015, to all customers affected by this
event.

Table of Contents
On June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries, et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha
County on behalf of an alleged class of residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint
alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and
negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the
class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the
risk of pipe failure and a large outage.
In February 2020, the Jeffries plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach of contract and negligence, and to determine the
applicability of punitive damages and a multiplier for those damages if imposed. In July 2020, the Circuit Court entered an order granting the Jeffries plaintiffs’
motion for certification of a class regarding certain liability issues but denying certification of a class to determine a punitive damages multiplier. In August
2020, WVAWC filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia seeking to vacate or remand the Circuit Court’s order
certifying the issues class. In January 2021, the Supreme Court of Appeals remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for further consideration in light of a
decision issued in another case relating to the class certification issues raised on appeal. On July 5, 2022, the Circuit Court entered an order again certifying a
class to address at trial certain liability issues but not to consider damages. On August 26, 2022, WVAWC filed another Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the
Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia challenging the West Virginia Circuit Court’s July 5, 2022 order, which petition was denied on June 8, 2023. The
case will now return to the circuit court for further discovery, rulings and ultimately a class trial on issues relating to duty and breach of that duty. The trial will
not find class-wide damages or punitive damages.
The Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has valid, meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint. WVAWC is
vigorously defending itself against these allegations. Given the current stage of this proceeding, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any
reasonably possible losses or a range of such losses related to this proceeding.
Chattanooga, Tennessee Water Main Break Class Action Litigation
On September 12, 2019, the Company’s Tennessee subsidiary (“TAWC”), experienced a leak in a 36-inch water transmission main, which caused service
fluctuations or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main by early morning on September 14, 2019,
and restored full water service by the afternoon of September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for all customers on September 16, 2019.
On September 17, 2019, a complaint captioned Bruce, et al. v. American Water Works Company, Inc., et al. was filed in the Circuit Court of Hamilton
County, Tennessee against TAWC, the Company and American Water Works Service Company, Inc. (“Service Company” and, together with TAWC and the
Company, collectively, the “Tennessee-American Water Defendants”), on behalf of a proposed class of individuals or entities who lost water service or suffered
monetary losses as a result of the Chattanooga incident (the “Tennessee Plaintiffs”). The complaint alleged breach of contract and negligence against the
Tennessee-American Water Defendants, as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil. In the complaint as originally filed, the Tennessee
Plaintiffs were seeking an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses, business and economic losses, out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use and
enjoyment of property and annoyance and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and pre- and post-judgment interest. In September 2020,
the court dismissed all of the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ claims in their complaint, except for the breach of contract claims against TAWC, which remain pending. In
October 2020, TAWC answered the complaint, and the parties have been engaging in discovery. On January 12, 2023, after hearing oral argument, the court
issued an oral ruling denying the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On February 9, 2023, the Tennessee Plaintiffs sought reconsideration of
the ruling by the court, and any final ruling is appealable to the Tennessee Court of Appeals, as allowed under Tennessee law.
TAWC and the Company believe that TAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint, and TAWC is vigorously
defending itself against these allegations. The Company cannot currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of any loss or a range
of such losses related to this proceeding.
Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions
Compliance with Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions—Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project
Under a 2009 order (the “2009 Order”) of the State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”), the Company’s California subsidiary (“Cal Am”) is
required to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to a set reduction schedule. In 2016, the SWRCB issued an
order (the “2016 Order,” and, together with the 2009 Order, the “Orders”) approving a deadline of December 31, 2021, for Cal Am’s compliance with these
prior orders.
23
Table of Contents
Cal Am is currently involved in developing the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”), which includes the construction
of a desalination plant, to be owned by Cal Am, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply
Project also includes Cal Am’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water and the
Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the “MPWMD”). The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill Cal Am’s obligations
under the Orders.
Cal Am’s ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is subject to administrative review by the CPUC and other government agencies,
obtaining necessary permits, and intervention from other parties. In September 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a final decision to authorize Cal Am to
enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to $50 million in associated
incurred costs, plus an allowance for funds used during construction (“AFUDC”), subject to meeting certain criteria.
In September 2018, the CPUC unanimously approved another final decision finding that the Water Supply Project meets the CPUC’s requirements for a
certificate of public convenience and necessity and an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects. The CPUC’s 2018
decision concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address estimated future water demands in Monterey, and, in addition to the cost
recovery approved in its 2016 decision, adopts Cal Am’s cost estimates for the Water Supply Project, which amounted to an aggregate of $279 million plus
AFUDC at a rate representative of Cal Am’s actual financing costs. The 2018 final decision specifies the procedures for recovery of all of Cal Am’s prudently
incurred costs associated with the Water Supply Project upon its completion, subject to the frameworks included in the final decision related to cost caps,
operation and maintenance costs, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters. The reasonableness of the Water Supply Project costs will be reviewed by the
CPUC when Cal Am seeks cost recovery for the Water Supply Project. Cal Am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid, minimize or offset
significant environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting
program, a reimbursement agreement for CPUC costs associated with that program, and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the
Water Supply Project in service. Cal Am has incurred $223 million in aggregate costs as of June 30, 2023 related to the Water Supply Project, which includes
$62 million in AFUDC.
In September 2021, Cal Am, Monterey One Water and the MPWMD reached an agreement on Cal Am’s purchase of additional water from an expansion
to the GWR Project, which is not expected to produce additional water until 2024 at the earliest. On December 5, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision that
authorized Cal Am to enter into the amended water purchase agreement, and specifically to increase pumping capacity and reliability of groundwater extraction
from the Seaside Groundwater Basin. The final decision sets the cost cap for the proposed facilities at approximately $62 million. Cal Am may seek recovery of
amounts above the cost cap in a subsequent rate filing or general rate case. Additionally, the final decision authorizes AFUDC at Cal Am’s actual weighted
average cost of debt for most of the facilities. On December 30, 2022, Cal Am filed with the CPUC an application for rehearing of the CPUC’s December 5,
2022 final decision, and on March 30, 2023, the CPUC issued a decision denying Cal Am’s application for rehearing, but adopting its proposed AFUDC for
already incurred and future costs. This decision also provided Cal Am the opportunity to serve supplemental testimony to increase its cost cap for certain of the
Water Supply Project’s extraction wells. The amended water purchase agreement and a memorandum of understanding to negotiate certain milestones related
to the expansion of the GWR Project have been signed by the relevant parties. Further hearings to be scheduled in a Phase 2 to this CPUC proceeding will
focus on updated supply and demand estimates for the Water Supply Project.
While Cal Am believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the Orders, as well as relevant final decisions of the
CPUC related thereto, Cal Am cannot currently predict its ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the Water Supply Project and there can
be no assurance that Cal Am will be able to recover all of such costs and expenses in excess of the $112 million in aggregate construction costs, plus applicable
AFUDC, previously approved by the CPUC in its 2016 final decision and its December 2022 final decision, as amended by its March 30, 2023 rehearing
decision.

Coastal Development Permit Application
In 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application (the “Marina Application”) to the City of Marina (the “City”) for those project
components of the Water Supply Project located within the City’s coastal zone. Members of the City’s Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons,
have publicly expressed opposition to the Water Supply Project. In May 2019, the City issued a notice of final local action based upon the denial by the
Planning Commission of the Marina Application. Thereafter, Cal Am appealed this decision to the Coastal Commission, as permitted under the City’s code and
the California Coastal Act. At the same time, Cal Am submitted an application (the “Original Jurisdiction Application”) to the Coastal Commission for a coastal
development permit for those project components located within the Coastal Commission’s original jurisdiction. After Coastal Commission staff issued reports
recommending denial of the Original Jurisdiction Application, noting potential impacts on environmentally sensitive habitat areas and wetlands and possible
disproportionate impacts to communities of concern, in September 2020, Cal Am withdrew the Original Jurisdiction Application in order to address the staff’s
environmental justice concerns. The withdrawal of the Original Jurisdiction Application did not impact Cal Am’s appeal of the City’s denial of the Marina
Application, which remains pending before the Coastal Commission. In November 2020, Cal Am refiled the Original Jurisdiction Application.
On October 5, 2022, Cal Am announced a phasing plan for the proposed desalination plant component of the Water Supply Project. The desalination
plant and slant wells originally approved by the CPUC would produce up to 6.4 million gallons of desalinated water per day. Under the phased approach, the
facilities would initially be constructed to produce up to 4.8 million gallons per day of desalinated water, enough to meet anticipated demand through about
2030, and would limit the number of slant wells initially constructed. As demand increases in the future, desalination facilities would be expanded to meet the
additional demand. The phased approach seeks to meet near-term demand by allowing for additional supply as it becomes needed, while also providing an
opportunity for regional future public participation and was developed by Cal Am based on feedback received from the community.
On November 17, 2022, the Coastal Commission approved the Marina Application and the Original Jurisdiction Application with respect to the phased
development of the proposed desalination plant, subject to compliance with a number of conditions, all of which Cal Am expects to satisfy. On December 29,
2022, the City, Marina Coast Water District (“MCWD”), MCWD’s groundwater sustainability agency, and the MPWMD jointly filed a petition for writ of
mandate in Monterey County Superior Court against the Coastal Commission, alleging that the Coastal Commission violated the California Coastal Act and the
California Environmental Quality Act in issuing a coastal development permit to Cal Am for construction of the slant wells. Cal Am is named as a real party in
interest. This matter remains pending.
Following the issuance of the coastal development permit, Cal Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary
information in connection with obtaining the remaining required permits for the Water Supply Project. However, there can be no assurance that the Water
Supply Project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Cal Am has complied with the
diversion limitations contained in the 2016 Order. Continued compliance with the diversion limitations in 2023 and future years may be impacted by a number
of factors, including, without limitation, continued drought conditions in California and the exhaustion of water supply reserves, and will require successful
development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand. The Orders remain in effect until Cal Am certifies to the SWRCB, and the
SWRCB concurs, that Cal Am has obtained a permanent supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized Carmel River diversions. While the Company
cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to comply with the Orders may result in
material additional costs and obligations to Cal Am, including fines and penalties against Cal Am in the event of noncompliance with the Orders.
West Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill
On June 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted final approval of a settlement class and global class action
settlement (the “Settlement”) for all claims and potential claims by all class members (collectively, the “West Virginia Plaintiffs”) arising out of the January
2014 Freedom Industries, Inc. chemical spill in West Virginia. The effective date of the Settlement was July 16, 2018. Under the terms and conditions of the
Settlement, WVAWC and certain other Company affiliated entities did not admit, and will not admit, any fault or liability for any of the allegations made by the
West Virginia Plaintiffs in any of the actions that were resolved.
As of June 30, 2023, $0.5 million of the aggregate Settlement amount of $126 million remains reflected in accrued liabilities, and $0.5 million in an
offsetting insurance receivable remains reflected in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets pending resolution of all asserted actual or potential
claims associated with this matter. The amount reflected in accrued liabilities reflects the status of the liability and the offsetting insurance receivable reflected
in other current assets, each as of as of June 30, 2023.

Weighted-average common shares outstanding—Diluted 195 182 190 182 
The effect of dilutive common stock equivalents is related to outstanding restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) granted
under the Company’s 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan and outstanding RSUs and PSUs granted under the Company’s 2017 Omnibus Equity
Compensation Plan, as well as estimated shares to be purchased under the Company’s 2017 Nonqualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Less than one
million share-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, because their
effect would have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.
The if-converted method is applied to the Notes issued in June 2023 for computing diluted EPS. For both periods presented, there was no dilution
resulting from the Notes. See Note 7—Long-Term Debt for additional information relating to the Notes.
Note 13: Fair Value of Financial Information
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:
Current assets and current liabilities—The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for current assets and current liabilities,
including revolving credit debt, due to the short-term maturities and variable interest rates, approximate their fair values.
Seller promissory note from the sale of the Homeowner Services Group (“HOS”) — The carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
for the seller promissory note, included as part of the consideration from the sale of HOS, is $720 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. This
amount represents the principal amount owed under the seller note, for which the Company expects to receive full payment. The accounting fair value
measurement of the seller note approximated $691 million and $686 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The accounting fair
value measurement is an estimate that is reflective of changes in benchmark interest rates. The seller note is classified as Level 3 within the fair value
hierarchy.
Preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt—The fair values of preferred stock with mandatory redemption
requirements and long-term debt are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs that are used to value each instrument. The fair value of
long-term debt classified as Level 1 is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 instruments are valued using observable inputs and Level 3
instruments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs.

Restricted funds—The Company’s restricted funds primarily represent proceeds received from financings for the construction and capital improvement
of facilities and from customers for future services under operation, maintenance and repair projects.
Rabbi trust investments—The Company’s rabbi trust investments consist of equity and index funds from which supplemental executive retirement plan
benefits and deferred compensation obligations can be paid. The Company includes these assets in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Deposits—Deposits include escrow funds and certain other deposits held in trust. The Company includes cash deposits in other current assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Deferred compensation obligations—The Company’s deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into notional
investment accounts. The Company includes such plans in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Company’s deferred
compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants’ notional investment accounts. The notional investments are comprised primarily of
mutual funds, which are based on observable market prices.
Mark-to-market derivative assets and liabilities—The Company employs derivative financial instruments in the form of treasury lock agreements,
classified as cash flow hedges, in order to fix the interest cost on existing or forecasted debt. The Company uses a calculation of future cash inflows and
estimated future outflows, which are discounted, to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract
terms, counterparty credit risk, interest rates and market volatility.
Other investments—The Company maintains a Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association trust for purposes of paying active union employee
medical benefits (“Active VEBA”). The investments in the Active VEBA trust primarily consist of money market funds and available-for-sale fixed income
securities.
The money market and other investments have original maturities of three months or less when purchased. The fair value measurement of the money
market and other investments is based on observable market prices and therefore included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.
The available-for-sale fixed income securities are primarily investments in U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds. The majority of U.S.
Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets. Certain U.S. Treasury
securities are based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, and are therefore categorized as
Level 2, because the valuations are calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate.

Contingent cash payment from the sale of HOS—The Company’s contingent cash payment derivative included as part of the consideration from the sale
of HOS, payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or before December 31, 2023, is included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The accounting fair value measurement of the contingent cash payment approximated $72 million, which is reflective of changes in the benchmark
interest rate and estimated using the probability of the outcome of receipt of the $75 million, a Level 3 input.
Note 14: Leases
The Company has operating and finance leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. Certain operating
leases have renewal options ranging from one to 60 years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. Renewal options that the
Company was reasonably certain to exercise are included in the Company’s right-of-use (“ROU”) assets. Certain operating leases contain the option to
purchase the leased property. The operating leases for real property, vehicles and equipment will expire over the next 37 years, six years, and three years,
respectively.
The Company participates in a number of arrangements with various public entities (“Partners”) in West Virginia. Under these arrangements, the
Company transferred a portion of its utility plant to the Partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial Development Bonds (“IDBs”) issued
by the Partners under the Industrial Development and Commercial Development Bond Act. The Company leased back the utility plant under agreements for a
period of 30 to 40 years. The Company has recorded these agreements as finance leases in property, plant and equipment, as ownership of the assets will revert
back to the Company at the end of the lease term. The carrying value of the finance lease assets was $144 million and $145 million as of June 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company determined that the finance lease obligations and the investments in IDBs meet the conditions for offsetting,
and as such, are reported net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are excluded from the lease disclosure presented below.
The Company also enters into O&M agreements with the Partners. The Company pays an annual fee for use of the Partners’ assets in performing under
the O&M agreements. The O&M agreements are recorded as operating leases, and future annual use fees of $2 million in 2023, $4 million in 2024 through
2027, and $45 million thereafter, are included in operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
29
Table of Contents
Rental expenses under operating leases were $3 million for each of the three months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, and $6 million for each of
the six months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, cash paid for amounts in lease liabilities, which includes operating cash flows from operating leases,
were $3 million and $5 million, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, there were ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease
liabilities of $4 million.
As of June 30, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term of the operating leases was 17 years, and the weighted-average discount rate of the
operating leases was 4%.
The future maturities of lease liabilities as of June 30, 2023 were $5 million in 2023, $10 million in 2024, $9 million in 2025, $8 million in 2026, $7
million in 2027, and $76 million thereafter. As of June 30, 2023, imputed interest was $37 million.
Note 15: Segment Information
The Company’s operating segments are comprised of its businesses which generate revenue, incur expense and have separate financial information
which is regularly used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its businesses
primarily through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. The Regulated Businesses segment also includes inter-segment revenues, costs
and interest which are eliminated to reconcile to the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company also operates other businesses, primarily MSG, that do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP, and are
collectively presented throughout this Form 10-Q within “Other,” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses. Other also
includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the Company’s Regulated Businesses, interest income related to the seller promissory note and income from
the revenue share agreement from the sale of HOS, eliminations of inter-segment transactions and fair value adjustments related to acquisitions that have not
been allocated to the Regulated Businesses segment. The adjustments related to the acquisitions are reported in Other as they are excluded from segment
performance measures evaluated by management.
The seller promissory note from the sale of HOS has a five-year term, is payable in cash, and bears interest at a rate of 7.00% per year during the term.
The Company recognized $12 million of interest income from the seller note for each of the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and $25 million of
interest income from the seller note for each of the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.
The Company recognized $3 million and $2 million of income during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $6 million and
$4 million of income during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from the revenue share agreements from the sale of HOS, which is
included in Other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read together with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto included elsewhere in this
Form 10-Q, and in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on
management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company’s business, operations and financial performance. The cautionary statements
made in this Form 10-Q should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements whenever they appear in this Form 10-Q. The Company’s actual
results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including
those that are discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements” and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The Company has a disclosure committee consisting of
members of senior management and other key employees involved in the preparation of the Company’s SEC reports. The disclosure committee is actively
involved in the review and discussion of the Company’s SEC filings.
Overview
American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured
by both operating revenues and population served. The Company’s primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater
services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers, collectively presented as the “Regulated Businesses.”
Services provided by the Company’s utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation,
collectively referred to as public utility commissions (“PUCs”). The Company also operates other businesses not subject to economic regulation by state PUCs
that provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities, collectively presented throughout this
Form 10-Q within “Other.” See Part I, Item 1—Business in the Company’s Form 10-K for additional information.
Financial Results
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, diluted earnings per share, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States (“GAAP”), were $1.44 and $2.37, respectively, an increase of $0.24 and $0.30, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior
year. These increases were primarily driven by the implementation of new rates in the Regulated Businesses for the recovery of capital and acquisition
investments, offset somewhat by increased production costs, including inflationary pressures and higher pension costs since mid-2022. Approximately 75% of
the estimated impact of increased production costs, including chemicals, power and other fuel, and of higher pension costs, are reflected in higher revenues in
2023 from rate cases recently completed. Results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, also reflect the favorable impact of weather, estimated at
$0.07 per share, due to warm, dry weather in the second quarter of 2023. Results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, also reflect the impact of
share dilution from the equity financing of $0.10 and $0.11 per share, respectively, which offsets the avoided interest expense.
Growth Through Capital Investment in Infrastructure and Regulated Acquisitions
The Company continues to grow its businesses, with the majority of its growth to be achieved in the Regulated Businesses through (i) continued capital
investment in the Company’s infrastructure to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to its customers, and (ii) regulated
acquisitions to expand the Company’s services to new customers. The Company plans to invest approximately $2.9 billion in these growth strategies in 2023.
During the first six months of 2023, the Company invested $1.2 billion, primarily in the Regulated Businesses, as discussed below:
Regulated Businesses - Growth and Optimization
• $1.15 billion capital investment in the Regulated Businesses, the substantial majority for infrastructure improvements and replacements; and
• $33 million to fund acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses, which added approximately 7,100 customers, in addition to approximately 9,500
customers added through organic growth. This includes the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary’s acquisition of the water and wastewater assets of
Egg Harbor City on June 1, 2023, for a cash purchase price of $22 million, $2 million of which was funded as a deposit to the seller in March
2021 in connection with the execution of the acquisition agreement.
Effective March 24, 2023, the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary acquired the rights to buy the wastewater system assets of the Township of
Towamencin, for an aggregate purchase price of $104 million, subject to adjustment as provided in the asset purchase agreement. This system provides
wastewater services to approximately 6,300 customer connections in seven townships in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The Company expects to close
this acquisition by mid-year 2024, pending regulatory approval.
32
Table of Contents
On October 11, 2022, the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the wastewater assets of the Butler Area Sewer
Authority for a total purchase price of $232 million in cash, subject to adjustment as provided for in the asset purchase agreement. This system provides
wastewater service for approximately 14,700 customer connections. The Company expects to close this acquisition by the end of 2023, pending regulatory
approval.
On April 6, 2023, the Company’s Illinois subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of the wastewater treatment plant from the City of
Granite City for $83 million, subject to adjustment as provided for in the asset purchase agreement. This system provides wastewater service for approximately
26,000 customer connections. The Company now expects to close this acquisition by the end of 2023, pending regulatory approval.
As of June 30, 2023, the Company had entered into 32 agreements with a total aggregate purchase price of $555 million for pending acquisitions in the
Regulated Businesses, including the agreements discussed above, to add approximately 74,800 additional customers.
Other Matters
Environmental, Health and Safety, and Water Quality Regulation
On March 14, 2023, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) announced the proposed National Primary Drinking Water Regulations
(“NPDWR”) for six per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) including perfluorooctanoic acid (“PFOA”), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (“PFOS”),
perfluorononanoic acid (“PFNA”), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (“HFPO-DA”, commonly known as “GenX Chemicals”), perfluorohexane sulfonic
acid (“PFHxS”), and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (“PFBS”). The proposed regulations would establish legally enforceable levels for PFAS in drinking water.
The EPA anticipates issuing a final rule by the end of 2023 and utilities will be provided a three-year window to comply with the new regulations once
finalized, although the Safe Drinking Water Act allows utilities to request an additional two years if capital improvements are required.
The Company performed an initial review of the NPDWR to assess the four parts per trillion requirements for PFAS and the application of the Hazard
Index approach for PFNA, PFBS, PFHxS, and GenX Chemicals. On May 24, 2023, the Company submitted comments to the EPA outlining its position on key
issues to address the proposed regulations, including its projected costs associated with PFAS treatment at the proposed limits and the potential impact to
customers’ bills. The Company estimates an investment in excess of $1 billion of capital expenditures to install additional treatment facilities over a three to
five-year period in order to comply with proposed regulations. Additionally, the Company estimates annual operating expenses of approximately $50 million
related to testing and treatment in today's dollars. These are preliminary estimates based on the proposed rule. The actual expenses may differ from these
preliminary estimates and will be dependent upon multiple factors, including the final rule and effective date, as well as the completion of a system-by-system
engineering analysis.
The Company supports sound policies and compliance with the NPDWR by all water utilities, while protecting customers and communities from the
costly burden of monitoring for and mitigating PFAS contamination in water systems. The Company continues to advocate for policies that hold polluters
accountable and is currently participating in the multi-district litigation and other lawsuits filed against certain PFAS manufacturers seeking damages and
reimbursement of costs incurred and continuing to be incurred to address contamination of public water supply systems by PFAS. The Company is monitoring
ongoing litigation and settlement activity with manufacturers of PFAS in these proceedings for potential impacts to the various claims asserted by the
Company.
Operational Excellence
The Company’s adjusted regulated operation and maintenance (“O&M”) efficiency ratio was 33.1% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, as
compared to 33.7% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The ratio reflects an increase in operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses, after
considering the adjustment for the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (“EADIT”) shown in the table below, as well as the continued
focus on operating costs.
The Company’s adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure and is defined by the Company as its operation and maintenance
expenses from the Regulated Businesses, divided by the operating revenues from the Regulated Businesses, where both operation and maintenance expenses
and operating revenues were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense. Operating revenues were further adjusted to exclude reductions for the
amortization of the EADIT. Also excluded from operation and maintenance expenses is the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs, mainly
depreciation and general taxes, which is reflected in the Regulated Businesses segment as operation and maintenance expenses, but for consolidated financial
reporting purposes, is categorized within other line items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The items discussed above were
excluded from the O&M efficiency ratio calculation as they are not reflective of management’s ability to increase the efficiency of the Regulated Businesses.
33
Table of Contents
The Company evaluates its operating performance using this ratio, and believes it is useful to investors because it directly measures improvement in the
operating performance and efficiency of the Regulated Businesses. This information is derived from the Company’s consolidated financial information but is
not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the
Company’s GAAP disclosures, and should be considered as an addition to, and not a substitute for, any GAAP measure. The Company’s adjusted regulated
O&M efficiency ratio (i) is not an accounting measure that is based on GAAP; (ii) is not based on a standard, objective industry definition or method of
calculation; (iii) may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures; and (iv) should not be used in place of the GAAP information provided
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.
Presented in the table below is the calculation of the Company’s adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio and a reconciliation that compares operation
and maintenance expenses and operating revenues, each as determined in accordance with GAAP, to those amounts utilized in the calculation of its adjusted
O&M efficiency ratio:

(a) Interim rates were effective May 1, 2022, and the difference between interim and final approved rates is subject to refund. The Virginia State Corporation Commission issued its final Order on
April 24, 2023.
On June 29, 2023, the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) issued a decision on the cost of capital application for the Company’s
California subsidiary, which authorizes a return on equity of 8.98% and a capital structure with an equity component of 57.04% for the three-year period from
2022 to 2024. The CPUC’s decision is not retroactive and will be effective from the date of the order through the end of 2024. The decision includes a Water
Cost of Capital Mechanism (the “WCCM”) that would allow the California subsidiary to increase its return on equity for the remainder of 2023 and 2024 based
on capital market rates. As authorized by the WCCM, on June 30, 2023, the California subsidiary filed with the CPUC staff an advice letter to seek a 52 basis
point increase to the return on equity for 2023, which was approved on July 25, 2023, increasing the return on equity to 9.50%, effective July 31, 2023.
On May 3, 2023, the Missouri Public Service Commission issued an order approving the March 3, 2023, joint settlement agreement in the general rate
case filed on July 1, 2022, by the Company’s Missouri subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $44 million annualized increase in water and
wastewater revenues, excluding $51 million in previously approved infrastructure surcharges, and authorized implementation of the new water and wastewater
rates effective May 28, 2023. The annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by significant incremental capital investments since the Missouri subsidiary’s
2021 rate case order. The Missouri subsidiary’s view of its rate base is $2.3 billion, and its view as to its return on equity and long-term debt ratio (each of
which is based on the general rate case order but was not disclosed therein) is 9.75% and 50.0%, respectively.
On April 24, 2023, the Virginia State Corporation Commission issued an order approving the settlement of the rate case filed on September 26, 2022, by
the Company’s Virginia subsidiary. The general rate case order approved an $11 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues. Interim rates in
this proceeding were effective on May 1, 2022, and the order requires that the difference between interim and the final approved rates is subject to refund
within 90 days of the order issuance. The order approves the settlement terms with a return on equity of 9.7% and a common equity ratio of 40.7%. The
annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by significant incremental capital investments since the Virginia subsidiary’s 2020 rate case order that have
been completed or were planned through April 30, 2023, increases in pension and other postretirement benefits expense and increases in production costs,
including chemicals, fuel and power costs. The general rate case order includes recovery of the Virginia subsidiary’s COVID-19 deferral balance. It also
includes approval of the accounting deferral of deviations in pension and other postretirement benefits expense from those established in base rates, until the
Virginia subsidiary’s next base rate case.
On December 8, 2022, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission issued an order approving the joint settlement agreement in the rate case filed on
April 29, 2022, by the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $138 million annualized increase in water and wastewater
revenues, excluding $24 million for previously approved infrastructure filings, and authorizes implementation of the new water and wastewater rates effective
January 28, 2023. The annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by significant incremental capital investments since the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s 2021
rate case order that will be completed through December 31, 2023, increases in pension and other postretirement benefits expense and increases in production
costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. The general rate case order also includes recovery of the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s COVID-19 deferral
balance. The Pennsylvania subsidiary’s view of its rate base is $5.1 billion, and its view as to its return on equity and long-term debt ratio (each of which is
based on the general rate case order but was not disclosed therein) is 10.0% and 44.8%, respectively.

Table of Contents
On December 15, 2022, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case filed on
February 10, 2022, by the Company’s Illinois subsidiary. As updated in the Illinois subsidiary’s June 29, 2022 rebuttal filing, the request sought $83 million in
additional annualized revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges. The general rate case order approved a $67 million annualized
increase in water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $18 million, effective January 1, 2023, based on
an authorized return on equity of 9.78%, authorized rate base of $1.64 billion, a common equity ratio of 49.0% and a debt ratio of 51.0%. The annualized
revenue increase is being driven primarily by significant water and wastewater system capital investments since the Illinois subsidiary’s 2017 rate case order
that have been completed or are planned through December 31, 2023, expected higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and increases in
production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs.
Pending General Rate Case Filings
On June 30, 2023, the Company’s Kentucky subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $26 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding
infrastructure surcharges of $10 million. An order is expected in the general rate case by the end of the first quarter of 2024.
On May 1, 2023, the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $45 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding
previously approved infrastructure surcharges of $7 million. The general rate case includes a future test year capturing planned investment through 2025 and an
order is expected to be reached by February 25, 2024. On June 30, 2023, the West Virginia subsidiary filed its annual infrastructure surcharge requesting $8
million in additional annualized revenues for planned investment through 2024. The infrastructure surcharge will be aligned with the investments recognized in
the general rate case if the future test year is approved.
On March 31, 2023, the Company’s Indiana subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $87 million in additional annualized revenues, excluding $41
million of revenue from infrastructure filings already approved, which includes three step increases, with $43 million of the increase to be included in rates in
January 2024, $18 million in May 2024, and $26 million in May 2025. An order is expected in the general rate case by the end of January 2024.
On July 1, 2022, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting an increase in 2024 revenue of $56 million and a total increase
in revenue over the 2024 to 2026 period of $95 million, all as compared to 2022 revenues. The Company updated its filing in January 2023 to capture the
authorized step increase effective January 1, 2023. The filing was also updated to incorporate a decoupling proposal and a revision to the Company’s sales and
associated variable expense forecast. The revised filing requested additional annualized revenues for the test year 2024 of $37 million, compared to 2023
revenues. This excludes the proposed step rate and attrition rate increase for 2025 and 2026 of $20 million and $19 million, respectively. The total revenue
requirement request for the three-year rate case cycle, incorporating updates to present rate revenues and forecasted demand, is $76 million.
Infrastructure Surcharges
A number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and
investments, such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure. Presented in the table
below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant water sales volume and customer count, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations
that became effective during 2023:

Pending Infrastructure Surcharge Filings
On March 1, 2023, the Company’s Kentucky subsidiary filed an infrastructure surcharge proceeding requesting $4 million in additional annualized
revenues. An order is expected in this proceeding in the third quarter of 2023. The infrastructure surcharge will reset to zero once the pending general rate case
becomes effective which is expected by the end of the first quarter of 2024.
Other Regulatory Matters
In September 2020, the CPUC released a decision under its Low-Income Rate Payer Assistance program rulemaking that required the Company’s
California subsidiary to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which would become
effective in January 2024. On October 5, 2020, the Company’s California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the decision and following the
CPUC’s denial of its rehearing application in September 2021, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a petition for writ of review with the California
Supreme Court on October 27, 2021. On May 18, 2022, the California Supreme Court issued a writ of review for the California subsidiary’s petition and the
petitions filed by other entities challenging the decision. Independent of the judicial challenge, California passed Senate Bill 1469, which allows the CPUC to
consider and authorize the implementation of a mechanism that separates the water corporation’s revenue and its water sales. Legislation was signed by the
Governor on September 30, 2022, and became effective on January 1, 2023. In response to the legislation, on January 27, 2023, the Company’s California
subsidiary filed an updated application requesting the CPUC to consider a Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism in its pending 2022
general rate case, which would be effective 2024 through 2026.
On March 2, 2021, an administrative law judge (“ALJ”) in the Office of Administrative Law of New Jersey filed an initial decision with the New Jersey
Board of Public Utilities (“NJBPU”) that recommended denial of a petition filed by the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary, which sought approval of
acquisition adjustments in rate base of $29 million associated with the acquisitions of Shorelands Water Company, Inc. in 2017 and the Borough of
Haddonfield’s water and wastewater systems in 2015. On July 29, 2021, the NJBPU issued an order adopting the ALJ’s initial decision without modification.
The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary filed a Notice of Appeal with the New Jersey Appellate Division on September 10, 2021. The Company’s New Jersey
subsidiary filed its brief in support of the appeal on March 4, 2022. Response and Reply briefs were filed on June 22, 2022, and August 4, 2022, respectively.
Oral argument was held on March 22, 2023, and the Company expects a decision by the end of 2023. There is no financial impact to the Company as a result of
the NJBPU’s order, since the acquisition adjustments are currently recorded as goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Segment Results of Operations
The Company’s operating segments are comprised of its businesses which generate revenue, incur expense and have separate financial information
which is regularly used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its businesses
primarily through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. The Company also operates other businesses, primarily MSG, that do not meet
the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP, and are collectively presented throughout this Form 10-Q within “Other.” Other also includes
corporate costs that are not allocated to the Company’s Regulated Businesses, interest income related to the seller promissory note and income from the
revenue share agreement from the sale of HOS, eliminations of inter-segment transactions and fair value adjustments related to acquisitions that have not been
allocated to the Regulated Businesses segment. This presentation is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses.

For the three months ended June 30, 2023, operating revenues increased $140 million, primarily due to a $110 million increase from authorized rate
increases, including infrastructure surcharges, principally to fund infrastructure investment in various states. In addition, operating revenues were higher by $10
million from water and wastewater acquisitions and organic growth in existing systems, as well as an $18 million estimated increase primarily due to drier than
normal weather in the second quarter of 2023.
For the six months ended June 30, 2023, operating revenues increased $222 million, primarily due to a $181 million increase from authorized rate
increases, including infrastructure surcharges, principally to fund infrastructure investment in various states. In addition, operating revenues were higher by $21
million from water and wastewater acquisitions and organic growth in existing systems, as well as an $18 million estimated increase primarily due to drier than

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, operation and maintenance expense increased $24 million and $39 million, respectively, primarily
due to inflationary impacts from increased fuel, power, and chemicals costs and an increase in employee headcount to support growth of the business.
Depreciation and Amortization
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, depreciation and amortization increased $15 million and $29 million, respectively, primarily due to
additional utility plant placed in service from capital infrastructure investments and acquisitions.
Other Income (Expenses)
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, other (expenses) increased $17 million and $41 million, respectively, due to higher interest expense as
a result of an $800 million long-term debt issuance in May 2022 and higher interest rates on short-term debt. The increase was also due to higher net periodic
pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the current period.

Provision for Income Taxes
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Regulated Businesses’ provision for income taxes increased $26 million and $36 million. The
Regulated Businesses’ effective income tax rate was 20.8% and 17.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 20.8% and 18.0%
for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the decrease in the amortization of EADIT pursuant to
regulatory orders. The amortization of EADIT is generally offset with a reduction in revenue.

Operating Revenues
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, operating revenues increased $20 million and $34 million, respectively, due primarily to the increase
in capital projects in MSG, primarily at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York and revenue for Naval Station Mayport in Jacksonville,
Florida, awarded on June 30, 2022, with the performance start date for operation on March 1, 2023.
Operation and Maintenance
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, operation and maintenance expense increased $20 million and $33 million, respectively, primarily
due to costs associated with the increased capital projects in MSG.
Legislative Updates
During 2023, the Company’s regulatory jurisdictions enacted the following legislation that has been approved and is effective as of July 26, 2023:
• California passed Senate Bill 1469, which allows the CPUC to consider and authorize the implementation of a mechanism that separates the water
corporation’s revenue and its water sales. Legislation was signed by the Governor on September 30, 2022, and was effective on January 1, 2023.
• Indiana passed House Bill 1417, which allows for deferred accounting and subsequent recovery through rates of regulatory assets, with or without
Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (the “IURC”) approval. There are several requirements: (i) the costs must be deferred as a regulatory
asset, (ii) only incremental costs may be deferred, and (iii) the IURC must find the costs to be reasonable and prudent. Legislation was signed by
the Governor and became effective on April 20, 2023.
• Indiana passed Senate Bill 180, which allows for consolidated revenue to support post-acquisition capital improvements in wastewater systems
via a service enhancement improvement recovery mechanism. Legislation was signed by the Governor and became effective on May 1, 2023.
• Illinois passed House Bill 1105, which provides that property belonging to a public utility that provides water or sewer service may not be taken
or damaged by eminent domain without prior approval from the Illinois Commerce Commission. Legislation was signed by the Governor and
became effective on June 9, 2023.

Table of Contents
• Illinois passed Senate Bill 250 (Public Act 103-0006), which contains supplemental appropriations for the previous fiscal year 2023 and
appropriations for fiscal year 2024. This bill contains a $5 million appropriation to the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity for
purposes of grants pursuant to the Water and Sewer Financial Assistance Act (Public Act 102-262) which was an initiative of the Company’s
Illinois subsidiary during the 102nd General Assembly. Legislation was signed by the Governor on June 7, 2023, and the appropriation became
effective July 1, 2023.
Condemnation and Eminent Domain
All or portions of the Regulated Businesses’ utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of the
following methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision
when the original certificate of public convenience and necessity (“CPCN”) was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the
state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its CPCN. The acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated
by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law
of the state or the jurisdiction of the particular CPCN.
As such, the Regulated Businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, the Monterey
water service system assets (the “Monterey system assets”) of the Company’s California subsidiary (“Cal Am”) are the subject of a potential condemnation
action by the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the “MPWMD”) stemming from a November 2018 public ballot initiative. In 2019, the
MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report, finding in part that (1) an estimate of the Monterey system assets’ total value plus
adjustments would be approximately $513 million, (2) the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in revenue requirements and
projected monthly water bills, and (3) the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible. In 2020, the MPWMD
certified a final environmental impact report, analyzing the environmental impacts of the MPWMD’s project to (1) acquire the Monterey system assets through
the power of eminent domain, if necessary, and (2) expand its geographic boundaries to include all parts of this system.
In February 2021, the MPWMD filed an application with the Local Agency Formation Commission of Monterey County (“LAFCO”) seeking approval
to become a retail water provider and annex approximately 58 parcels of land into the MPWMD’s boundaries. In June 2021, LAFCO’s commissioners voted to
require a third-party independent financial study as to the feasibility of an acquisition by the MPWMD of the Monterey system assets. In December 2021,
LAFCO’s commissioners denied the MPWMD’s application to become a retail water provider, determining that the MPWMD does not have the authority to
proceed with a condemnation of the Monterey system assets. On April 1, 2022, the MPWMD filed a lawsuit against LAFCO challenging its decision to deny
the MPWMD’s application seeking approval to become a retail water provider.
By letter dated October 3, 2022, the MPWMD notified Cal Am of a decision to appraise the Monterey system assets and requesting access to a number
of Cal Am’s properties and documents to assist the MPWMD with such an appraisal. Cal Am responded by letter on October 24, 2022, denying the request for
access, stating that the MPWMD does not have the right to appraise Cal Am’s system without LAFCO approval to become a retail water provider.
Notwithstanding the denial by LAFCO of the MPWMD’s application seeking to be a retail water provider, the MPWMD notified Cal Am by letter dated April
3, 2023, of its offer to purchase the Monterey system assets for $448.8 million. On April 28, 2023, Cal Am rejected the MPWMD’s offer. The MPWMD has
reserved its right to determine whether to acquire the Monterey system assets through the exercise of eminent domain. For more information on the lawsuit
against LAFCO, see Item 3—Legal Proceedings in the Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1—Legal Proceedings—Proposed Acquisition of Monterey System Assets
—Local Area Formation Commission Litigation in this Form 10-Q.
Furthermore, the law in certain jurisdictions in which the Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property
owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of
damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, for example, lawsuits have
been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities
triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be
recovered from customers in rates, but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could
respond to some or all of such losses, although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that
exceed the limits of such insurance.

Tax Matters
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA contains a Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax
(“CAMT”) provision, effective January 1, 2023. To determine if a company is considered an applicable corporation subject to CAMT, the company’s average
adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) for the three consecutive years preceding the tax year must exceed $1 billion. An applicable corporation must
make several adjustments to net income when determining AFSI. The Company evaluated the potential impacts of the CAMT provision within the IRA and
believes it does not exceed the $1 billion AFSI threshold, and therefore, is not currently subject to CAMT in 2023. The Company is continuing to assess the
impact of the initial guidance regarding the application of the CAMT and will continue to monitor as additional guidance is released.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For a general overview of the sources and uses of capital resources, see the introductory discussion in Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Company’s Form 10-K.
Liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments are generally funded through cash flows from operations,
public and private debt offerings, commercial paper markets, future issuances of equity, and, if and to the extent necessary, borrowings under American Water
Capital Corp.’s (“AWCC”) revolving credit facility.
The Company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from
operations. Since the Company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cash flows from operating activities, the Company
currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the next five years through a combination of long-
term debt and equity issuances, in addition to the remaining proceeds from the sale of HOS. The remaining proceeds from the sale of HOS include receipt of a
seller promissory note, plus interest, and a contingent cash payment payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or before December 31, 2023. If
necessary, the Company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. In
this event, the Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an
extended period of time.
On March 3, 2023, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 12,650,000 shares of its common stock. Upon closing of
this offering, the Company received, after deduction of the underwriting discount and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately
$1,688 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to repay short-term commercial paper obligations of AWCC, the wholly owned finance
subsidiary of American Water, and for general corporate purposes.
On June 29, 2023, AWCC, issued $1,035 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”). AWCC
received net proceeds of approximately $1,022 million, after deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deduction of offering expenses
payable by AWCC. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations and the remainder is being used for general
corporate purposes. See Note 7—Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The Company’s revolving credit facility provides $2.75 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of financial institutions. The
revolving credit facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support, and to provide for the
issuance of up to $150 million in letters of credit. The maximum aggregate principal amount of short-term borrowings authorized for issuance under AWCC’s
commercial paper program is $2.60 billion. Subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum
commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $500 million and to request extensions of its expiration date for up to two one-year periods. As of
June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were
$75 million and $78 million, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility. At June 30, 2023, there was no outstanding short-
term debt as the net proceeds of the Notes were used to repay the short-term commercial paper obligations. At December 31, 2022, the weighted-average
interest rate on AWCC’s outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 4.41%.

The Company believes that its ability to access the debt and equity capital markets, the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will
generate sufficient cash to fund the Company’s short-term requirements. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its
expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets. However, there can be no assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing
commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility, or that AWCC will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on
acceptable terms or at all. See Note 8—Short-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The Company had entered into eleven 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $300 million. The Company designated these
treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. In June 2023, the Company
terminated the treasury lock agreements realizing a net gain of $3 million included in Other, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
No ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 or 2022.

liabilities, net.
For the six months ended June 30, 2023, cash provided by operating activities increased $518 million, primarily due to changes in deferred taxes and
working capital. The change in deferred taxes was driven by the settlement of the deferred tax liability related to the Company’s New York regulated operations
that was sold in the first quarter of 2022. The changes in working capital were driven by $280 million of estimated tax payments for taxable gains on the sales
of the Company’s Homeowner Services Group and its New York regulated operations in the first half of 2022.

Net short-term repayments with maturities less than three months (1,175) (164)
Debt issuance costs and make-whole premium on early debt redemption (13) (7)

Other financing activities, net (a) 24 36 
Net cash provided by financing activities $ 1,257 $ 441 
(a) Includes proceeds from issuances of common stock under various employee stock plans and the Company’s dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan, net of taxes paid, and
advances and contributions in aid of construction, net of refunds.
For the six months ended June 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities increased $816 million, primarily due to the common stock financing and
issuance of long-term debt. This was partially offset by repayment in full of the short-term commercial paper obligations during the first half of 2023.
Debt Covenants
The Company’s debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that the Company is not in compliance with these
covenants, an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and the Company, or its subsidiaries, may be restricted in its ability to pay
dividends, issue new debt or access the revolving credit facility. The long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things,
prohibit or restrict the Company from issuing debt secured by the Company’s assets, subject to certain exceptions. Failure to comply with any of these
covenants could accelerate repayment obligations.
Covenants in certain long-term notes and the revolving credit facility require the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated
capitalization (as defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On June 30, 2023, the Company’s ratio was 0.56 to 1.00 and therefore the
Company was in compliance with the covenants.
Security Ratings
Presented in the table below are long-term and short-term credit ratings and rating outlooks as of July 26, 2023, as issued by Moody’s Investors Service
on December 19, 2022, and S&P Global Ratings on February 6, 2023:
SecuritiesMoody’s Investors
ServiceStandard & Poor’s
Ratings Service
Rating outlook Stable Stable
Senior unsecured debt Baa1 A
Commercial paper P-2 A-1
A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating
agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in
an amount sufficient to service debt and meet investment plans. The Company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to
maintain its existing ratings. None of the Company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings,
although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility.

Table of Contents
As part of its normal course of business, the Company routinely enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, chemicals and other
services. These contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future
performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a
credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a
downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that the Company must provide
collateral to secure its obligations. The Company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.
Access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by the
Company’s securities ratings. The Company primarily accesses the debt capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through AWCC. However, the
Company has also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of mortgage bonds and tax-exempt securities or borrowings under state
revolving funds, to lower the overall cost of debt.
Dividends
For discussion of the Company’s dividends, see Note 6—Shareholders’ Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Financial condition of the Company, results of operations and cash flows, as reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial statements, are impacted
by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. See Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in the Company’s Form 10-K for a discussion of its critical
accounting policies. Additionally, see Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for updates, if any, to the
significant accounting policies previously disclosed in the Company’s Form 10-K.
Recent Accounting Standards
See Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new accounting standards recently
adopted or pending adoption.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Company is exposed to market risk in the normal course of business, including changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates. For
further discussion of its exposure to market risk, see Part II, Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in the Company’s Form 10-
K. There have been no significant changes to the Company’s exposure to market risk since December 31, 2022.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
American Water maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective.
The Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2023.
Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company concluded that there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months
ended June 30, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions
Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project
CPUC Final Approval of Water Supply Project
On March 30, 2023, the CPUC issued a decision denying Cal Am’s application for rehearing, but adopting its proposed AFUDC for already incurred and
future costs. The decision also provides Cal Am the opportunity to serve supplemental testimony to increase its cost cap for certain of the Water Supply
Project’s extraction wells. The amended water purchase agreement and a memorandum of understanding to negotiate certain milestones related to the
expansion of the GWR Project have been signed by the relevant parties. Further hearings to be scheduled in a Phase 2 to this CPUC proceeding will focus on
updated supply and demand estimates for the Water Supply Project.
While Cal Am believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, as well as
relevant final decisions of the CPUC related thereto, Cal Am cannot currently predict its ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the
Water Supply Project and there can be no assurance that Cal Am will be able to recover all of such costs and expenses in excess of the $112 million in
aggregate construction costs, plus applicable AFUDC, previously approved by the CPUC in its 2016 final decision and its December 2022 final decision, as
amended by its March 30, 2023 rehearing decision.
Water Supply Project Land Acquisition and Slant Well Site Use
The Monterey County Superior Court has reset the trial date to February 21, 2024 for the City of Marina’s lawsuit against Cal Am and CEMEX
regarding claims of breach of contract and declaratory relief.
Challenges Related to Compliance with California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act
On May 3, 2023, the City filed a second reverse validation complaint, challenging the adoption of amendments to the GSP for the 180/400 subbasin,
which complaint has also been stayed.
Proposed Acquisition of Monterey System Assets — Local Area Formation Commission Litigation
Notwithstanding the denial by LAFCO of the MPWMD’s application seeking to be a retail water provider, which is currently being challenged by the
MPWMD, the MPWMD notified Cal Am by letter dated April 3, 2023, of its offer to purchase the Monterey system assets for $448.8 million. On April 28,
2023, Cal Am rejected the MPWMD’s offer. The MPWMD has reserved its right to determine whether to acquire the Monterey system assets through the
exercise of eminent domain.
Dunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation
On June 8, 2023, the Petition for Writ of Prohibition filed by WVAWC in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia challenging the West Virginia
Circuit Court’s July 5, 2022 order was denied. The case will now return to the circuit court for further discovery, rulings and ultimately a class trial on issues
relating to duty and breach of that duty. The trial will not find class-wide damages or punitive damages. The Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has
valid, meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint, and WVAWC is vigorously defending itself against these allegations.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, readers should carefully consider the factors discussed in Item 1A—Risk Factors in the Form
10-K, and in the Company’s other filings with the SEC, which could materially affect the Company’s business, financial condition, cash flows or future results.
There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A—Risk Factors in the Form 10-K.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
In February 2015, the Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of shares issued through the
Company’s dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan and employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities. The program allows the
Company to purchase up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock over an unrestricted period of time in the open market or through privately
negotiated transactions. The program is conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, and, to facilitate these repurchases, the Company
enters into Rule 10b5-1 stock repurchase plans with a third-party broker, which allow the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock at times when it
otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Subject to applicable regulations,
the Company may elect to amend or cancel the program or the stock repurchase parameters at its discretion to manage dilution.
The Company did not repurchase shares of common stock during the three months ended June 30, 2023. From April 1, 2015, the date repurchases under
the anti-dilutive stock repurchase program commenced, through June 30, 2023, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 4,860,000 shares of common stock
under the program, leaving an aggregate of 5,140,000 shares available for repurchase under this program.

(as defined below) (the “ Change of Control Date ”). At the time of distribution, all Stock Units shall be converted to an equivalent
number of shares of Company Stock, and the Participant shall receive a single distribution of such shares of Company Stock, which
shall be issued under the Plan. For purposes of this Grant, the term “Change of Control” shall have the same meaning as such term is
defined in the Plan, except that a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Grant
unless the event constituting the Change of Control constitutes a change in ownership or ef fective control of the Company , or in the
ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company , within the meaning of section 409A  of the Code and its
corresponding regulations.
5. Deferrals . The Participant may make an irrevocable election to defer the Specified Date (or further defer the Deferred
Date (as defined below), if applicable) of all of the Stock Units, plus dividend equivalents earned on such Stock Units as described
in Paragraph 6 below , to a later date, provided that (i) the election shall not take ef fect until at least twelve (12) months after the date
on which the election is made, (ii) the deferred Specified Date cannot be earlier than five (5) years from the original Specified Date
under Paragraph 4 (or five (5) years from the applicable Deferred Date, if a subsequent deferral of a Deferred Date is being made),
and (iii) the election must be made no less than twelve (12) months prior to the date of the Specified Date (or twelve (12) months
prior to the previously applicable Deferred Date, if a subsequent deferral of a Deferred Date is being made). To defer the Specified
Date, the Participant must elect to defer 100% of the Stock Units, including corresponding dividend equivalents, granted to the
Participant under this Grant and complete the deferral election form provided to the Participant, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A or as may subsequently modified in the discretion of the Board. If the Participant desires to make a further deferral, the
Participant must make such election on a separate form provided for such purpose. Any such election shall be made in accordance
with section 409A  of the Code and any corresponding guidance and regulations issued under section 409A  of the Code.
Notwithstanding a Participant’ s election pursuant to this Paragraph, if the Separation from Service Date or Change of Control Date
occurs prior to the Deferred Date, the distribution of the Participant’ s Stock Units, plus corresponding dividend equivalents, will be
made as a result of the occurrence of the Separation from Service Date or Change of Control Date, whichever is earlier . If a
Specified Date is delayed one or more times pursuant to this Paragraph 5, the new Specified Date shall be referred to as the
“Deferred Date.”
6. Dividend Equivalents . Until the earlier of the Specified Date (or the Deferred Date, if elected), Separation from
Service Date or Change of Control Date, if any dividends are paid with respect to the shares of Company Stock, the Company shall
credit to a dividend equivalent account (the “ Dividend Equivalent Account ”) the value of the dividends that would have been
distributed if the Stock Units credited to the Participant’ s Stock Unit Account as of the date of payment of any such dividend were
shares of Company Stock. At the same time that the Stock Units are converted to shares of Company Stock and distributed to the
Participant, the Company shall pay to the Participant in a lump sum cash equal to the value of the dividends credited to the
Participant’ s Dividend Equivalent Account. No interest shall accrue on any dividend equivalents credited to the Participant’ s
Dividend Equivalent Account.
7. Change of Control . Except as set forth above, the provisions set forth in the Plan applicable to a Change of Control
(as defined in the Plan) shall apply to the Stock Units, and, in the event of a Change of Control, the Board may take such actions as it
deems appropriate pursuant to the Plan and is consistent with the requirements of section 409A  of the Code.
8. Acknowledgment by Participant . By accepting this Grant, the Participant acknowledges that with respect to any right
to distribution pursuant to this Grant, the Participant is and shall be an unsecured general creditor of the Company without any
preference as against other unsecured general creditors of the Company , and the Participant hereby covenants for himself or herself,
and anyone at any time claiming through or under the Participant, not to claim any such preference, and hereby disclaims and waives
any such preference which may at any time be at issue, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law . The Participant also hereby
agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Grant. The Participant further agrees to be bound by the
determinations and decisions of the Board with respect to this Grant and the Plan and the Participant’ s rights to benefits under this
Grant and the Plan, and
2
agrees that all such determinations and decisions of the Board shall be binding on the Participant, his or her beneficiaries and any
other person having or claiming an interest under this Grant and the Plan on behalf of the Participant.
9. Restrictions on Issuance or Transfer of Shares of Company Stock .
(a) The obligation of the Company to deliver shares of Company Stock upon the distribution of the Stock Units shall be
subject to the condition that shares of Company Stock be qualified for listing on the New York Stock Exchange or another securities
exchange and be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and that any consent or approval of any governmental
regulatory body that is necessary to issue shares of Company Stock has been so obtained, and that shares of Company Stock may not
be issued in whole or in part unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been ef fected or obtained
free of any conditions not acceptable to the Board. The issuance of shares of Company Stock and the payment of cash to the
Participant pursuant to this Grant is subject to any applicable taxes and other laws or regulations of the United States or of any state
having jurisdiction thereof.
(b) As a condition to receive any shares of Company Stock upon conversion of the Stock Units, the Participant agrees:
(i) to be bound by , and to comply with, the Company’ s policies and practices (as they may be in ef fect from time
to time) regarding the restrictions or limitations on the transfer of such shares, and understands that the Participant may be
restricted or prohibited at any time and from time to time from selling, transferring, pledging, donating, assigning, mar gining,
mortgaging, hypothecating or otherwise encumbering the shares in accordance with such policies and practices, including
without limitation the Company’ s Insider Trading and Prohibited Transactions Policy and its Personal Securities Trading and
Preclearance Practice; and
(ii) that the shares of Company Stock obtained by the Participant upon the distribution of the Stock Units shall not
be transferred or disposed of by any means until the Participant owns enough shares of Company Stock, or shares underlying
stock units convertible into shares of Company Stock, or time-based restricted Company Stock, to meet or exceed five (5)
times the Participant’ s annual cash retainer , which ownership requirement must be satisfied by the fifth (5th) anniversary of
the Participant’ s commencement of service as a director on the Board.

12. No Rights to Continued Service . This Grant shall not confer upon the Participant any right to be retained in the
service of the Employer (as defined in the Plan) and shall not interfere in any way with the right to terminate the Participant’ s service
at any time. The right to terminate at will the Participant’ s service at any time for any reason is specifically reserved.
13. Assignment and Transfers . No Stock Units or dividend equivalents awarded to the Participant under this Grant may
be transferred, assigned, pledged, or encumbered by the Participant and the Stock Units and dividend equivalents shall be distributed

(b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Grant, if any of the distributions under this Grant are payable to
