Table of ContentsOur Cereal Partners Worldwide 
(CPW) joint venture with Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) competes in the ready-to-eat cereal category in markets outside NorthAmerica, and our 
Häagen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ) joint venture co mpetes in the super-premium ice c ream category in Japan. For net sales contributed byeach class of simila
r products, please see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.Customers. 
Our primary customers ar e grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, e-commerce 
retailers, comme rcial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, convenience stores, and pet specialty stores. Wegenerally sell to thes
e customers through our direct sales fo rce. We use broker and distribution arrangements for certain products and to serve certain typesof customers. For further in
formation on our customer credit and product return practices, please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial State ments inItem 8 of this report. 
During fiscal 2018, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates (Walmart) accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 30 percent ofnet sales of our North Americ
a Retail segment. No other customer a ccounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. For further informationon significant customers, p
lease refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.Competition. 
The packaged foods categori es are highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and throughout the world. The categories
 in which we participate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailerswith their own branded products. Compet
itors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substant
ial financial, marketing, and other resources. Competition in our p roduct categories is based on product innovation, productquality, price, brand re
cognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and theability to identify and s
atisfy consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights,effective custome
r relationships, superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation a ligned with consumers’ needs, anefficient supply chain, 
and price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products, but also with regionalbrands and with generic 
and private label product s that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we compete with both multi-national and localmanufacturers, and ea
ch country includes a unique group of competitors.Raw materials, ingredients, and packaging. 
The principal raw mate rials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), dairy products, sugar, fruits, vegetable oils, meats, nu
ts, vegetables, and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated, plastic and metalpackaging materials, op
erating supplies, and energy. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian opera tions are purchased from suppliers in theUnited States. In our other int
ernational operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may be imported from other countries. The costof these inputs may 
fluctuate widely due to ex ternal conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations,currency fluctuations, 
and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. We have some long-term fixed pr ice contracts, but themajority of our inputs ar
e purchased on the open market. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally andwhere possible, we make advance pu
rchases of items significant to our business in o rder to ensure continuity of operations. Our objective is to procurematerials meet
ing both our quality standards and our production needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs generally represent the larges
t variable cost in manufacturing our products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movementsfor some inputs using a varie
ty of risk management strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides us efficient access to, and moreinformed knowledge of, various co
mmodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventories that are carried at net realizablevalue and uses 
derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures.

rademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registr ations are properly maintained and they have not beenfound to have become generi
c. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use.Some of our products are mark
eted under or in combination with trademarks that have been licensed from others for both long-standing products (e.g.,Reese’s
Puffs
for cereal, Green
Giant

 for refrigerated dough, frozen pastries, and baking products) andshorter term promotion
al products (e.g., fruit snacks sold under various third party equit ies).Our cereal tradema

elated trademarks are owned by Liberté Marques Sàrl, an entity in which we own a 50 p ercent interest.We continue our focus on develop
ing and marketing innovative, proprietary products, many of which use proprie tary expertise, recipes and formulations.We consider the colle
ctive rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses arematerially 
dependent upon any single patent o r group of related patents.SEASONALITY
In general, demand for our p
roducts is evenly balanced throughout the year. However, within our North America Retail segment demand for refrigerateddough, 
frozen baked goods, and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand for Progresso
 soup is higher during the fall and wintermonths. Internationally, wi
thin our Europe & Australia and Asia & Latin America segments, demand for Häagen-Dazs
 ice cream is higher du ring thesummer months and demand for b
aking mix and dough products increases during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends, as well as the different s
easons in the northern and southern hemispheres, our international segments’ net sales are generally evenly balanced throughout theyear.

Our business is subject to various r
isks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financialcondition, and results of oper
ations.The categories in which we participate are ve
ry competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
The consumer and pet food cat
egories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categorie s are manufacturers, as wellas retailers with the
ir own branded and private label products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal compe
titors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product c ategories, we compete not only with otherwidely advertised branded produ
cts, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices.Competition in our product 
categories is based on produc t innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing,promotional activity, 
convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our l arge competitorswere to seek an advantage th
rough pricing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins andprofitability. If we did no
t do the 
8

Table of Contentssame, our revenues and mark
et share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are notsuccessful in introducing innov
ative products in response to changing consumer d emands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we areunable to build and sustain brand 
equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products.
We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the fac
e of a consolidating retail environment.There has been significan
t consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large retail customersmay seek to use their posit
ion to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand nameproducts, increased emphas
is on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketingexpertise, product innovat
ion, knowledge of consumers’ needs, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volumegrowth could be negatively 
impacted. In addition, th e loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2018, Walmartaccounted for 21 percent o
f our consolidated net sales and 30 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. In its fiscal y ear endedDecember 31, 2017, PetSmart (inc
luding Chewy.com as of June 1, 2017) and Petco accounted for 41 percent and 18 percent, respectively, of Blue Buffalo’snet sales. National pet supe
rstore chains have experienced re duced store traffic. If national pet superstore chains continue to experience reduced store traffic,or experience any opera
tional difficulties, our Pet segment operating results may be adversely affected. For more information on signific ant customers,please see Note 7 to the Consolida
ted Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.Price changes for the 
commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may advers ely affect our profitability.The principal raw mate
rials that we use are commodities that expe rience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, product scarcity,limited sources of supply, co
mmodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity pric
e changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. If we are unable to increaseproductivity to offset th
ese increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profi tability. We do not fully hedge againstchanges in commodity pric
es, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.Volatility in the market value of der
ivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our grossmargins and 
net earnings. We utilize deriva
tives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natur
al gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility inboth gross margin and net earn
ings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocatedcorporate items outsid
e our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and lossesare 
reclassified to segment operating profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result ofthese accounting treatments.
If we are not efficient in our production, our profi
tability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate.Our future success and earnings g
rowth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitivemarkets. Gaining additiona
l efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminatingredundant costs

Table of Contentsresulting from acquisi
tions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiativesinvolve complex reorgani
zation of manufacturing faci lities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption ofproduction, which may negative
ly impact product volume and margins. We are currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to 
increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any ofthe anticipated bene
fits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.
Our ability to make, move, and s
ell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distributioncapabilities due to weather
, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemic, strikes, import/exportrestrictions, or other factor
s could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location.Our suppliers’ policies and pr
actices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate thelikelihood or 
potential impact of su ch events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a singlesupplier or location, could 
adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certa
in food products or ingredients. We could be adversely af
fected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these 
types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production anddelivery disruptions.
If our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabel
ed, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims ifconsumers 
or their pets are injured. We may need to recal
l some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significantlosses due to the costs of a re
call, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could alsosuffer losses from a si
gnificant product liability judgment against us. A signific ant product recall or product liability case could also result in adversepublicity, damage to our r
eputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.
We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer prefer
ences and trends, which may result in decreased demand for our products. Our success depends in part on our abi
lity to anticipate the tastes, eating habits and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appe al totheir preferences 
in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected bya number of different 
trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identi fy or react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerginge-commerce 
channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and pro
fitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effectsof ingredients such as sodium, t
rans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, o r other product ingredients or attributes. 
10

Table of ContentsWe may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster g
rowing and more profitable categories. The food industry’s growth potentia
l is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the m
arkets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products infaster growing and more prof
itable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability to incr ease market share in our existing product categories.If we do not succeed in developing 
innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth may slow, which could adversely affect ourprofitability.
Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.
The willingness of consumers to pur
chase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers maypurchase 
more generic, privat e label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience areduction in sales of highe
r margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of e conomic conditions orcompetitive actions, we 
may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consumeaway from home at custome
rs that purchase products from our Convenience Stor es & Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverseeffect on our results of op
erations.Our results may be negatively impact
ed if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.Maintaining and continual
ly enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is based inlarge part on the degre
e to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number offactors, including consume
r perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain thequality of our products, the f
ailure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our productsbecoming unavailable to 
consumers. Consumer demand for our products m ay also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotionalsupport. The use of social and digi
tal media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative pos
ts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands andreputation. If we do not main
tain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be nega tively impacted.Our international operations are subject to pol
itical and economic risks.In fiscal 2018, 29 percent of ou
r consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationa
lly, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include: 
•
 political and economic instability;•
 exchange controls and currency exchange rates;•
 tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export;•
 nationalization of operations;•
 compliance with anti-corruption regulations;•
 foreign tax treaties and policies; and•
 restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.Our financial perform
ance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause materialvariations in our results o
f operations. Our principal exposures are 
11

Table of Contentsto the Australian dollar, Br
azilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. Fromtime to time, we ente
r into agreements that are intended to r educe the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not beeffective in signif
icantly reducing our exposure.New regulations or regulatory-based claims could advers
ely affect our business.Our facilities and produc
ts are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food andDrug 
Administration, the Occupat ional Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to theproduction, packaging, label
ling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of ou r employees. Our failure tocomply with such laws and regulat
ions could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls ofour products. We advertise ou
r products and could  be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreignlaws and regulations. We may 
also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on theaudience to whom products are 
marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost ofdoing business or restrict our 
actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.We are subject to var
ious federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with environmental laws andregulations could su
bject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental remediationobligations. Due to regulatory 
complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigat ion, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties ofours, the potential exi
sts for remediation, liability, indemnification, and compliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or
 compliance with environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect onour business and results of opera
tions.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adverse
ly affect our ability to paydividends.
As of May 27, 2018, we had total debt, redee
mable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $16.9 billion. The agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us fro
m incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our: 
•
 ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to ourdebt securities by rat
ing organizations were revised downward; and •
 flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.There are various finan
cial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of theserequirements, the re
lated indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtainadditional or altern
ative financing may also be adversely affected.Our ability to make schedul
ed payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which inturn 
is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. 
12

Table of ContentsGlobal capital and credit market issues could negat
ively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.
We depend on stable, liquid, and we
ll-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we believ e that our operating cash flows,financial assets, access to
 capital and credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future,there can be no 
assurance that future vo latility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.We also utilize interest rate derivati
ves to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are not effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience anincrease in our costs of bor
rowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting fromtighter capital and credit markets 
or a slowdown in the general economy. Volatility in the securities 
markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs.
We sponsor a number of defined b
enefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various fo reign locations, including defined benefit pension,retiree health and we
lfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in aglobally diversified portf
olio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates,investment returns, and th
e market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodicbenefit cost and future 
funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negativeimpact on our results of 
operations and cash flows from op erations.Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology syste
ms fail to perform adequately or are breached. Information technology 
serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the inte
rnet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply withregulatory, legal, and t
ax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effecti vely manage our key business processesincluding digital mark
eting, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. Thesetechnologies enable 
internal and externa l communication among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt andstorage of personal infor
mation about our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on servic
es provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such ascatastrophic events, na
tural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failure s, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers,employee error or malfeasance, a
nd other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our informationtechnology 
systems, as well as the confid entiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. The failure of our information technologysystems to perform as we ant
icipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims orproceedings, regulatory pen
alties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational,reputational, legal, 
and financial impacts that may have a mate rial adverse effect on our business.A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a di
fferent weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangibl
e assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.As of May 27, 2018, we had $20.9 billion of goodwill and inde
finite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested forimpairment annually 
and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
13

Table of Contentsthat impairment m
ay have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If thefair value of the repo
rting unit is less than the carrying va lue of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair valueare determined based on 
a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estima
tes of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. Our Latin America and U.S. Yogurtreporting units have exper
ienced declining business performance and we continue to monitor these bus inesses. While we currently believe that our goodwillis not impaired, diffe
rent assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.We evaluate the useful lives
 of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Blue

brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Rea ching a determination on useful life requiressignificant judgments and 
assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability ofthe industry, known 
technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes indistribution channels), th
e level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Our indefinite-lived in
tangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recover
able. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projectedrevenues from our long-rang

We may fail to realize a
ll of the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.Our ability to realiz
e the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Blue Buffalo, which is a complex, costly and tim
e-consuming process. We have never operated in the pet food sector and our lack of experience in this sector may hinder ourability to manage Blue Buff
alo successfully following the acquisition.The integration process
 may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges 
involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition could cause an interruption of,or a loss of momentum in, our ope
rations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the integra
tion of Blue Buffalo may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, compe titive responses, and loss of customersand other business relationsh
ips. Additional integration challenges include: 
 
• diversion of management’s attention to integration matters; 
• difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the acquisition; 
• difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; 
• difficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures; 
• difficulties in the assimilation of employees; 
• challenges in keeping existing customers, including Blue Buffalo’s largest customer that accounted for 41% of its fiscal year ended December 31,2017 net sales and obtaining new custo
mers; 
14

Table of Contents 
• difficulties in building and operating new and existing manufacturing facilities; 
• challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; 
• the impact of potential liabilities we may be inheriting from Blue Buffalo; and 
• coordinating a geographically dispersed organization.Many of these factors will b
e outside of our control and any one of them could resul t in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, anddiversion of management
’s time and energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and result in us becoming subject to lit
igation. In addition, even if Blue Buffalo is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not berealized, including th
e synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipa ted. These benefits may not be achieved within theanticipated time 
frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. All of these factors could causereductions in our earnings 
per share and decrease o r delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition. As a result, it cannot be assured that the BlueBuffalo acquisition will r
esult in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.Blue Buffalo may underperform relative to our 
expectations.The business and financial pe
rformance of Blue Buffalo are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. We may not be able to maintain the growth rate, levelsof revenue, earnings, or oper
ating efficiency that we and Blue Buffalo have achieved or might achieve separately. Our failure to do so could have a materialadverse effect on our f
inancial condition and results of operations.Our failure to successfully integ
rate other acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.From time to time, we eva
luate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success depends, in part, upon ourability to integrat
e acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. Additionalpotential risks associa
ted with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers o f the acquired business, theassumption of unknown liabiliti
es, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited priorexperience, failure to achieve 
anticipated synergies, an d the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.

Table of ContentsITEM 7    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
We are a global packag
ed foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We workcontinuously to 
improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equityof our brands over time with st
rong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We beli eve our brand-buildingstrategy is the key to winning and sus
taining leading share positions in markets around the globe.Our 
fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segmentoperating profit, earn
ings per share (EPS), free cash flow, cash return to shareholders, and return on average total capital are ke y drivers of financialperformance for our busin
ess.Our long-term growth objectiv
es are to consistently deliver: 
•
 low single-digit annual growth in organic net sales;•
 mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit;•
 high single-digit annual growth in diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability;•
 improvement in adjusted return on average total capital;•
 free cash flow conversion averaging above 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and•
 cash return to shareholders averaging above 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield.We believe that this financial 
performance should result in long-term value creation for shareholders.Fiscal 2018 represented an i
mportant step in returning our business to sustainable topline growth. We made significant progress toward competing moreeffectively, with strong 
innovation, marketing, and in-store execution driving positive o rganic sales growth in each of our last three fiscal quarters. We alsomoved to reshape our portfol
io for future growth with the acquisition of Blue Buff alo, a fast-growing, highly profitable pet food business. While our full-year profit results f
ell short of our initial plans, we finished fiscal 2018, delivering growth in net sales, total segment operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjust
ed diluted EPS in the fourth quarter. We maintained a disciplined focus on cash generation, resulting in significant growth in freecash flow this year. We gene
rated substantial Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings, and we re ached our expected annualized savings goal of$700 million in fiscal 2018, co
mpared to the fiscal 2015 base, from recent restructuring actions. However, these results were not enough to offsetheightened input 
cost inflation, incre ases in other costs impacting cost of sales, and higher merchandising expense. Importantly, we made investments toaccelerate our differential growth
 platforms and expanded our capabilities in e-commerce and Strategic Revenue Manage ment (SRM), which are critical tofuture growth.
Net sales growth rates 
for our North American Retai l operating segment improved significantly compared to fiscal 2017 as good consumer marketingsupport, strong innovation, and improv
ed in-store execution helped restore momentum. Our Convenience Stores & Foodse rvice operating segment’s netsales increased on innovat
ion behind Focus 6 platforms and market-index pricing on flour. Our Europe & Australia segment’s net sales increased on favorable foreign cur
rency exchange and successful innovation and distribution expansion for ice cream and snack bars. In our Asia & Latin Americasegment, improved 
in-market execution in Asia was overshadowed by a di fficult general ledger implementation and a comparison to fiscal 2017 thatincluded an extra month of 
results reported for Brazil. All of our segments’ operating profit results were impacted by higher than expected input costinflation that was not ful
ly offset by our HMM initiatives.Our consolidated net sales fo
r fiscal 2018 rose 1 percent to $15.7 billion. On an organ ic basis, net sales essentially matched year-ago levels. Operating profit of $2.5 billion decreased 2 pe
rcent. Total segment operating

ined 5 percent and declined 6 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of $3.64 was up 31 percent compared to fiscal2017. Adjusted 
diluted EPS, which excludes certa in items affecting comparability of results, was up 1 percent to $3.11 per share and was flat on a constant-currency basis. Our return on av
erage total capital was 12.7 percent, and adjusted return on average total capi tal decreased 190 basis points to 9.7 percentand decreased 200 basis points on a 
constant-currency basis (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally ac
cepted accounting principles (GAAP)).Net cash provided by operations to
taled $2.8 billion in fiscal 2018 representing a conversion rate of 131 percent of net earnings, including earningsattributable to red
eemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $623 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2.2 billion at a conversion 
rate of 120 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrollinginterests. We also re
turned significant cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1.1 billion and shar e repurchases totaling $602 million.A detailed review of our fis
cal 2018 performance appears below in the section titled “Fisca l 2018 Consolidated Results of Operations.”As we turn to fiscal 2019, we remain 
focused on our Consumer First strategy and our global growth prioriti es to further improve our topline momentum. Weplan to compete effectively acro
ss all our brands and geographies, increase investments to accelerate our differential growth platforms, and maximize thegrowth 
opportunities for Blue Buffalo as we integrate the business into the General Mills portfolio. We also plan to maintain our efficiency in this moreinflationary cost envi
ronment, and we have initiatives underway to help protect our profitability. We expect the operating env ironment in fiscal 2019 tocontinue to be dynamic, requ
iring us to increase our agility while remaining focused on delivering on consumers’ expectations. Our fiscal 2019 targetsreflect the invest
ments we are making to enhance our capabilit ies and accelerate our growth, as well as the impact of adding Blue Buffalo to our portfolio.We believe that thes
e initiatives will drive strong returns over the long term and further advance us toward our goal of consistently delivering profitable growth and 
top-tier returns for our shareholde rs.Our key full-year fisca
l 2019 targets include:  
•
 Organic net sales are expected to be in a range between flat and up 1 percent. Including the impact of the Blue Buffalo acquisition, net sales areexpected to increase 9 
to 10 percent.•
 Constant-currency adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 6 to 9 percent from the base of $2.7 billion reported in fiscal 2018.•
 Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS are expected to range between flat and down 3 percent from the base of $3.11 earned in fiscal 2018. Thisestimate includes 
a 4-cent headwind related to the Blue Buffa lo acquisition, driven by the impact of purchase accounting.We continue to pursue our Consumer Fi
rst strategy and execute against our three key growth priorities: 1) competing effectively on all brands and across allgeographies through strong innovat
ion, effective consumer marketing, and excellent in-store execution; 2) accel erating growth on our four differentialgrowth platforms including 
H
 ä
agen-Dazs
ice cream, snack bars, Old
El
Paso
 Mexican food, and our portfolio o f natural and organic food brands; and 3)reshaping our portfolio through g
rowth-enhancing transactions, including the recent acquisition of Blue Buffalo. W e also intend to pursue divestitures ofgrowth-dilutive businesses to fu
rther reshape our portfolio. By focusing on these priorities, we expect to generate consistent topline growth, which, whenbalanced with a 
disciplined focus on margin expansion, cash conversion, and cash returns, should create significant value for our shareholders.See the 
“Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP.Certain terms

IDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOn April 24, 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo, which be
came our Pet operating segment. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and accordingly, in fis
cal 2018, our results do not include Pet segment operating results.In fiscal 
2018, net sales increased 1 pe rcent compared to last year. Operating profit margin of 15.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by lower s
egment operating profit results partially offset by  a decrease in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs and favorablemark-to-market 
valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit marg in decreased 90 basis points to 17.2 percent, primarily driven byhigher input costs i
ncluding currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets partially offset by lower selling, general and administrativeexpenses. Diluted earnings per sh
are of $3.64 increased 31 percent compared to fiscal 2017, and adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain itemsaffecting comparability, essentiall
y matched year-ago levels on a constant-cur rency basis (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description ofour use of measures not defin

Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.Cost of sales 
increased $257 million in fiscal 2018 to $10,313 million. The increase included a $452 million increase attributable to product rate and mixand a $116 million decreas
e attributable to lower volume. We recorded a $32 million net decrease in cost of sal es related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity posi
tions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to anet decrease of $14 mil
lion in fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2018, we recorded $14 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales compared to $42 million in fiscal2017. We also recorded 
$11 million of restructu ring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2018 compared to $44 million in fiscal 2017(please see Note 4 to the Consolid
ated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report).Gross margin 
declined 2 percent in f iscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 34 percent decreased 110 basis points compared to fiscal 2017.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 
expenses decreased $49 mil lion to $2,753 million in fiscal 2018 compared to f iscal 2017. The decrease inSG&A expenses primarily refl
ects savings from cost management initiatives and an 8 percentage point decrease in media and advertising expense. Inaddition, we recorded $34 mil
lion of transaction and integr ation costs related to our acquisition of Blue Buffalo. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales infiscal 2018 decreased 40 bas
is points compared to fiscal 2017.Restructuring, impairment, and other exit cos
ts totaled $166 million in f iscal 2018 compared to $183 million in fiscal 2017.During the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2018, we executed our fiscal 2019 planning process and preliminary long-range planning process, which resulted in lowerfuture sales and profit
ability projections in our plans for our businesses supporting the Yoki
 , Mountain
High
, and Immaculate
Baking
brand intangible assets. As a result, we recorded 
a $97 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fisc al 2018.In fiscal 2018, we approved global 
cost savings initiatives designed to reduce administrative costs and align resources behind high growth initiatives. Werecorded $49 million of r
estructuring charges relating to this action in fiscal 2018.

e Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding our restructuring activities. Interest, net 
for fiscal 2018 totaled $374 million, $79 million higher than fiscal 2017, primarily driven by $36 million of charges re lated to the bridge termloan credit facil
ity that provided backup financing for the Blue Buffalo acquisition, higher average debt balances, and $14 million of charges related to therepurchase of medium term 
notes, partially offse t by changes in the mix of debt.Our consolidated 
effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 2.7 percent compared to 28.8 percent in fiscal 2017. The 26.1 p ercentage point decrease wasprimarily due to the prov
isional net benefit of $524 million recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Our effective tax rateexcluding certain 
items affecting co mparability was 25.7 percent in fiscal 2018 compared to 29.2 percent in fiscal 2017 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a descrip
tion of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The 3.5 percentage point de crease in the effective tax rate excluding certainitems affecting co
mparability was primarily due to the lower U.S. federal blended statutory rate for fiscal 2018 as a result of the TCJA, partially offset by certain discrete events recorded
 during fiscal 2017.On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA signifi
cantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax sys tem, including a reduction in theU.S. corporate inc
ome tax rate, implementation of a territorial system, and a one-time deemed repatriat ion tax on untaxed foreign earnings. The TCJA also resulted in a U.S. federal bl
ended statutory rate of 29.4 percent for us in fiscal 2018. Generally, the impacts of the new legislation would be required to berecorded in the period of 
enactment, which for us was the third quarter of fiscal 2018. However, Accounting Standa rds Update 2018-05:

earnings from joint ventures of $85 million in fiscal 2018 was flat compared to fiscal 2017, as favorable foreign currency exchange for CPWwas offset by unfavorable for
eign currency exchange and lower net sales for HDJ and our $2 million after-tax share of a restructur ing charge at CPW. On aconstant-currency basis, 
after-tax earnings from joint ventu res decreased 3 percent, including the CPW restructuring charge (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for

IDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSFiscal 
2017 includes an additional mon th of results from General Mills Brasil Alimentos Ltda (Yoki) (please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8 of 
this report).In fiscal 2017, operating r
esults reflected challenging net sales performance. However, we continued to make progress against our cost savings and marginexpansion initiatives. The n
et sales decline of 6 percent was driven by declining contributions from volume in the North America Retail and Europe &Australia segments includ
ing the impact of the divestiture of the North American Green Giant product lines in f iscal 2016, which were partially offset byfavorable net price 
realization and mix. Operating profit margin of 16.4 percent was up 10 basis points from fiscal 2016 levels primarily driven by benefitsfrom cost 
savings and spending optimizat ion initiatives and favorable net price realization, partially offset by the gain from the Green Giantdivestiture. Adjusted opera
ting profit margin increased 130 basis points to 18.1 percent, driven by benefits from cost savings and spending optimizationinitiatives and favor
able net price realization. Diluted EPS of $2.77 was flat to fiscal 2016 and adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affectingcomparability, on a

Table of ContentsOur consolidated 
effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 28.8 percent compared to 31.4 percent in fiscal 2016. The 2.6 p ercentage point decrease wasprimarily due to 
non-deductible expenses related to the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability was 29.2 perc
ent in fiscal 2017 compared to 29.8 percent in fiscal 2016 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description ofour use of measures not 
defined by GAAP). After-tax 
earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2017 decreas ed to $85 million compared to $88 million in fiscal 2016 primarily driven by unfavorableforeign currency exchang

On April 24, 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo, which be
came our Pet operating segment. Our businesses are now organized into five operating segments:North 
America Retail; Convenien ce Stores & Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet. We are reporting the Pet operating segmentresults on a 
one-month lag and accordingly, in fiscal 2018, ou r results do not include Pet segment operating results.In the third quarter of 
fiscal 2017, we announced a new global organization structur e to streamline our leadership, enhance global scale, and drive improvedoperational agility 
to maximize our growth capabilities. We restated our fiscal 2016 net sales by segment and segment operating profit amounts to reflect our new operating segments. These s
egment changes had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operating profit, net earnings attributableto General Mills, or earn
ings per share.

in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for ou r use of this measure not defined byGAAP).
Segment operating profit 
for fiscal 2017 increas ed 21 percent to $84 million from $69 million in fiscal 2016, primarily driven by growth in theHäagen-Dazs 
business in China and the impact o f an additional month of results from Yoki in fisca l 2017. Asia & Latin America segment operating profitincreased 20 percent on a 
constant-currency basis in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for ou r use of thismeasure not defined by GAAP).
PET SEGMENT
Our Pet operating segment inc
ludes pet food products sold primarily in the United States in specialty channels, including national pet superstore chains,regional pet store cha
ins, neighborhood pet stores, and farm and feed stores; e-commerce retailers; military outlets; hardware  stores; veterinary clinics andhospitals; and grocery and m
ass merchandisers. Our product categories inc lude dog and cat food (dry foods, wet foods, and treats) made with whole meats,fruits and vegetables, and o
ther high-quality natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product offerings address specific dietary, lifestyle, and life-stage needs and spans different product 
types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions and textures, and cuts for wet foods. We arereporting the Pet operat

Table of ContentsUNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS
Unallocated corporate 
items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to theGeneral 
Mills Foundation,  asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and otheritems that are not pa
rt of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until pass
ed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of 
this report.For fiscal 2018, unallocated 
corporate expense totaled $117 million compared to $190 million last year. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $32 million netdecrease in expense re
lated to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories comp ared to a $14 million net decrease inexpense in the prior year. 
In addition, we recorded $14 million of restructuring charges, and $11 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs incost of 
sales in fiscal 2018, compa red to $42 million of restructuring charges and $44 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of salesin fiscal 2017. We also re
corded $34 million of transaction and integration costs related to our acqu isition of Blue Buffalo.For fiscal 2017, unallocated 
corporate expense totaled $190 million compared to $289 million in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we recorded a $14 million netdecrease in expense re
lated to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a  $63 million net decrease inexpense in the prior year. 
In addition, we recorded $42 million of restructuring charges, and $44 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs incost of sales in 
fiscal 2017, compared to $78 m illion of restructuring charges and $58 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of salesin fiscal 2016. The decreas
e in unallocated corporate expense also reflects lower incentive expense in fiscal 2017 compa red to fiscal 2016.IMPACT OF INFLATION
We experienced input cos
t inflation of 4 percent in fiscal 2018, 1 percent in fiscal 2017, and 2 percent in fiscal 2016, primarily on commodity inputs. We expect input cost infla
tion of approximately 5 percent in fiscal 2019. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, planning, and operatingpractices. Our risk manag
ement practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. LIQUIDITY
The primary source of our 
liquidity is cash flow from op erations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $8.0 billion in cash.A substantial portion of this ope
rating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use cash f romoperations to fund our capit
al expenditures and acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt and occasionallyissue shares of stock to finan
ce significant acquisitions and major capital exp ansions.As of May 27, 2018, we had $383 million of cash and c
ash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. As a result of the TCJA, the historic undistribu tedearnings of our foreign subsidi
aries will be taxed in the U.S. via the one-time repatriation tax in fiscal 2018. We are re-evaluating our indefinite reinvestment assert
ions in connection with the TCJA. As of the end of fiscal 2018, we have recorded a provisional estimate for local country withholdingtaxes related to certain 
entities from which we expe ct to begin repatriating undistributed earnings. As a result of the transition tax, we may repatriate ourcash and cash equivalents he
ld by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. income tax liability. In fis cal 2018, werepatriated a port
ion of our foreign cash holdings to finance part of the Blue Buffalo acquisition, to reduce commercial paper, and for general corporatepurposes. Please see Note 14 to the Consolid
ated Financial Statements in Part II, I tem 8 of this report for further information on our indefinite reinvestmentassertion.

 In fiscal 2018, cash provided by ope
rations was $2.8 billion compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2017. The $426 million increase was pr imarily driven by the$462 million increase in n
et earnings and the $736 million change in current assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $688 million change in deferredincome taxes. The change 
in deferred income t axes was primarily related to the $638 million provisional benefit from revaluing our net U.S. deferred taxliabilities to re
flect the new U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of the TCJA. The $736 million change in current assets and liabilities  was primarily due tochanges in accounts payable o
f $476 million related to the extension of payment terms and timing of payments, and $264 million of changes in other currentliabilities primarily driven by 
changes in income taxes pay able, trade and advertising accruals, and incentive accruals.We strive to grow core working c
apital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fisca l 2018, core working capital decreased 27 percent, comparedto a net sales increas

reased 41 percent, compared to net sales decline of 6 percent.In fiscal 2017, our 
operations generated $2.4 bi llion of cash, compared to $2.8 billion in fiscal 2016. The $349 million decrease was primarily driven by a$493 million change in curr

changes in income taxes payable, a decrease in incentive accruals, and changes in trade and advertising accruals due to reducedspending. The change 
in current assets and li abilities was also impacted by the timing of accounts payable. Additionally, we recorded a $14 million loss ona divestiture during fis
cal 2017, compared to a $148 million net gain on divestitures during fiscal 2016, and classified the re lated cash flows as investingactivities.

 In February 2018, we entered into a 
fee-paid commitment lett er with certain lenders, pursuant to which such lenders com mitted to provide a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term lo
an credit facility (the “Bridge Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $8.5 billion to provide the financing for theacquisition of Blue Buffalo. The Br
idge Facility expired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.

Table of ContentsTo ensure availability o
f funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable. Commercial pap er is a continuing source ofshort-term financing. 
We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have uncommitted and asset-backedcredit lines that suppor
t our foreign operations. The credit facilities contain se veral covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverageratio of at least 2.5 times.
Certain of our 
long-term debt agree ments, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 27, 2018, we werein compliance with all o
f these covenants.We have $1,600 million of long-
term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $1,150 million of 5.65 percent notes due February 2019, €300.0 million euro-deno
minated floating-rate notes due March 20, 2019, and $100 million of 6.59 percent fixed rate medium term notesdue for remarketing in Oc
tober 2018. We believe that cash flows from operations, togethe r with available short- and long-term debt financing, will beadequate to meet our l
iquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.As of May 27, 2018, our total debt, including 
the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 73 percent in fixed-rate and 27 percent in floating-rate inst
ruments, compared to 67 percent in fixed-rate and 33 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 28, 2017.We believe that our f
ixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength. Our fixedcharge coverage rat
io in fiscal 2018 was 5.89 compared to 7.26 in fiscal 2017. The measure decreased from fiscal 2017 as earnings before income taxes andafter-tax 
earnings from joint ventu res decreased by $136 million and interest expense increased by $83 million in fiscal 2018. Our operating cash flow todebt ratio decreased 7.5 p
ercentage points to 18.0 percent in fiscal 2018, primarily driven by an increase in long-term debt.We have a 51 percent cont
rolling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each 
of these entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. We record Sodiaal’s 50 percent interestin Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marqu
es Sàrl as noncontrolling inte rests, and its 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on ourConsolidated Balance Sheets. These 
euro- and Canadian dollar-denominated interests are reported in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to pu
t all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. As ofMay 27, 2018, the redemption value o
f the redeemable interest was $776 million which approximates its fair value.The third-party holder of 
the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distri butions from available net incomebased on the applicatio
n of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252 million
). For fiscal 2018, the floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A Interests was equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus125 basis points. The 
preferred return r ate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through aremarketing auction. On June 1, 2018, subs
equent to our fiscal year-end, the floating prefer red return rate on the Class A Interests was reset to the sum ofthree-month LIBOR plus 142.5 basis points.
We have an option to purchase 
the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whol
e amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder’s capital account from its original value will becharged directly to r
etained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that p eriod.OFF-BALANCE 
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSAs of May 27, 2018, we have issued guarantees and

Operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (c)
The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and forconsumer marketing spending 
commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arr angements are considered purchase obligations if acontract specifies 
all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of thetransaction. Most 
arrangements are c ancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on theConsolidated Balance Sheets as a
ccounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.(d)
The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was $16 million asof May 27, 2018, based on fair marke
t values as of that date. Future changes in mark et values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or receivedto settle those instrum
ents in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of cert
ain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneousliabilities. We exp
ect to pay $20 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and $18 million of defe rred compensation in fiscal2019. We are unable to rel
iably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2019. As of May 27, 2018, our total liability for uncertain taxpositions and accrued inte
rest and penalties was $223.6 million. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
 ESTIMATESFor a complete descript
ion of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Oursignificant accounting estimate
s are those that have a meaningful impact 
39

Table of Contentson the reporting of our finan
cial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation oflong-lived assets, intangib
le assets, redeemable inter est, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit,and postemployment benefi
t plans.Promotional Expenditures
Our promotional 
activities are condu cted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments tocustomers to perform m
erchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list p rices to lower retail shelf prices;payments to gain distribut
ion of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The recognition of these costs requires estimation 
of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing andforecasted costs of prom
otional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated expens es and actual costs are recognized as a change inmanagement estima
te in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and consumer marketing liabilities were $500 million as of May 27, 2018, and$483 million 
as of May 28, 2017. Because our total pro motional expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, ifour estimates are in
accurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effec t on our results of operations.Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
We estimate the use
ful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events orchanges in 
circumstances indic ate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discountedcash flows or independent appra
isals, as appropriate.Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other 
indefinite-lived intangible as sets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changesin circumstances indicate that im
pairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determ ined based on adiscounted cash flow model. We us
e inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates ofdiscount rates, perpetui
ty growth assumptions, market comparables, and other f actors.We evaluate the usefu
l lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Rea ching a determination onuseful life requires s
ignificant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (suchas the stability of the 
industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, andexpected changes in di
stribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are 
deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.Our estimate of the fa
ir value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inpu ts which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty 
rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.As of May 27, 2018, we had $20.9 billion of goodwill and inde
finite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying va
lue and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regardingfuture performance o
f our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material im pairment losses and amortization expense.We performed our fisc
al 2018 assessment of our intangible assets as of August 28, 2017. As of our annual assessment date, there was no impairment of anyof our 
intangible assets as the ir related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values except for the

brand intangible assets and U.S. Yogurt reporting unit had risk of de

Progresso
brand intangible assets and the Latin America r eporting unit for potential impairment.During the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2018, we executed our fiscal 2019 planning process and preliminary long-rang e planning process, which resulted in lowerfuture sales and profit
ability projections in our plans for our businesses supporting the Yoki
 , Mountain
High
, and Immaculate
Baking
brand intangible assets. As a 
result of this trigger ing event, we performed an interim impairment assessment of these assets as of May 27, 2018, and determ ined that the fairvalue of these brand assets no 
longer exceeded the carrying values of the respective assets. Significant assumpt ions used in that assessment included ourupdated long-range cash flow pro
jections for the businesses, royalty rates, weighted average cost of capital rates, and tax rates. We recorded a $97 millionimpairment charge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 related to these assets.Redeemable Interest
In fiscal 2018, we adjusted the 
redemption value of Sodiaal’s redeemable interest in Yoplait SAS based on a discounted cash flow model. The significantassumptions used to estimat
e the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending,depreciation and taxes, 
foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. As of May 27, 2018, the redemption value of t he redeemable interest was$776 million.
Stock-based Compensation
The valuation of stock options is 
a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a materialimpact 
on our financial state ments. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividendyield, and the forfeitu
re rate. For more information on these assumptions, please see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial State ments in Item 8 of thisreport.
The estimated fair v
alues of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: 
 
  Fiscal Year   
  2018    2017    2016   
 Estimated fair valu
es of stock options granted  $ 6.18     $ 8.80     $ 7.24   Assumptions:
       Risk-free interest rate
   2.2 %     1.7 %     2.4 %   Expected term
   8.2 years      8.5 years      8.5 years    Expected volatility
   15.8 %    17.8 %    17.6 %  Dividend yield
   3.6 %     2.9 %     3.2 %   
  
41

Table of ContentsThe risk-free inter
est rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effec t at the time ofgrant. An increase in the exp
ected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by 20 percent. If all other assumptions are held constan
t, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2018 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal2018 option awards by 8 percent.
To the extent that actu
al outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values.Historical data has a sign
ificant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead toprospective revisions in our 
assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comp arability of stock-based compensation expense.Any corporate income tax ben
efit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously r ecognized in earnings (referred to as a windfalltax benefit) is presen
ted in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual impact on future years’ cash flows will depend,in part, on 
the volume of employee sto ck option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of theunderlying stock and the origin
al grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes.Realized windfall tax ben
efits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the ConsolidatedStatement of Earnings. Becaus
e employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported resultscould occur if differ
ent assumptions or conditions were to prevail.Income Taxes
We apply a 
more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognit ion and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of taxbenefit that has a gre
ater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately real ized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expectedultimate resolution o
f uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. For more information on income taxes, please see Note 14 tothe Consolidated Financial Sta
tements in Item 8 of this report.Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Bene
fit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans We have defined benefi
t pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom. We also sponsor plans that provide heal
th care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we alsoprovide accruable bene
fits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Ple ase see Note 13 to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, andpostemployment benefit p
lans.We recognize benefi
ts provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives. Accordingly, we make variousassumptions to predict and m
easure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significantmanagement judgment and 
have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and  accumulated benefit obligationsinclude the long-term 
rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets
Our expected rate 
of return on plan assets is de termined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of futurelong-term returns by asse
t class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflat ion assumptions. Wereview this assumption annual
ly for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantlyinfluence our evaluation.
 
42

Table of ContentsOur historical investmen
t returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assetswere 8.5 percent, 8.5 percent, 6.5 p
ercent, 9.1 percent, and 8.0 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 27, 2018.On a weighted-average basis, th
e expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 7.88 percent for fiscal 2018, 8.17 percent for fiscal 2017, and 8.53 percent for fiscal 2016. For 
fiscal 2019, we lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefitpension and other postretir
ement plans in the United States to 7.35 percent due to asset changes that de creased investment risk in the portfolio.Lowering the expected long-t
erm rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and pos tretirement expense by $67 million forfiscal 2019. A market-re
lated valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related val uation recognizes certain investmentgains or losses over a five-y
ear period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expectedreturn calculated 
using the market-related value  of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries performthese calculations as p
art of our determination of annual expense or income.Discount Rates
Beginning in fiscal 2017, we changed th
e method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for ourUnited States and most of our int
ernational defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. We adopted a full yield curve approach to estim
ate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation tothe relevant projec
ted cash flows. This method provides a more precise measuremen t of service and interest costs by correlating the timing of the plans’liability cash flows to th
e corresponding rate on the yield curve. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-averagediscount rate derived f
rom the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This change does not affect themeasurement of our bene
fit obligations related to these plans. We have accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimatebeginning in the first quar
ter of fiscal 2017.Our discount rate assumptions a
re determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benef it pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemploymentbenefit plan obligations. 
We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond y
ield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. Thisforward interest rat
e curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. Our weighted-average discount 
rates were as follows:

Table of ContentsLowering the discount rates by 100 bas
is points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefitplan expense for fiscal 2019 by 
approximately $55 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line methodover the average rem
aining service period of active plan partici pants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan isviewed as “all or almost
 all” inactive participants.Health Care Cost Trend Rates
We review our health care 
cost trend rates annual ly. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and informationprovided by our actuaries. This 
information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organi
zations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, andshort-term expectations. 
Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.0 p ercent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.7 percent for retirees under age 65at the end of fiscal 2018. Rat
es are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations o
nly if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary,to approximate the cur
rent economic view on the rate of long-term inflation  plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for healthcare costs have an importa
nt effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.A one percentage point change 
in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

laims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experiencegains and losses are amort
ized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the averageremaining lifetime of the remaining
 plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or a lmost all” inactive participants.Financial Statement Impact
In fiscal 2018, we recorded ne
t defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $23 million compared to$56 million of expense in fis
cal 2017 and $163 million of expense in fiscal 2016. As of May 27, 2018, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net lossesof $1.8 billion on our defined bene
fit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuari al net gains of $40 million on our postretirement andpostemployment benefit pla
ns, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates, partially offset by recent increases in the values of planassets. 
These unrecognized actua rial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currentlyexceed the corridors de
fined by GAAP.Actual future net defin
ed benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investmentperformance, changes in f
uture discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in theseplans.

Table of ContentsRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRON
OUNCEMENTSIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Stand
ards Board (FASB) issued new hedge accounting requirements. The new standard amends the hedgeaccounting 
recognition and presenta tion requirements to better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting. The new standard alsosimplifies the appli
cation of hedge accounting guidance. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting  periods beginning afterDecember 15, 2018, and interim p
eriods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. We are inthe process of analyzing th
e impact of this standard on ou r results of operations and financial position.In March 2017, the FASB issued new accounting requi
rements related to the presentation of net per iodic defined benefit pension expense, net periodicpostretirement bene
fit expense, and net periodic postemployment benefit expense. The new standard requires the service cost component of net periodicbenefit expense to be 
recorded in the same l ine items as other employee compensation costs within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Othercomponents of net periodic b
enefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In add ition,the new standard req
uires that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligible for capitalization. We recognized net periodicbenefit expense of $23 mil
lion in fiscal 2018, $56 million in fiscal 2017, and $163 million in fiscal 2016 of which $123 million, $141 million, and$161 million, respective
ly, related to service cost. These amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent tothe adoption of this new standard. Th
e new standard requires retrospective adoption of the presentation of net periodic benefit expense and prospectiveapplication of the cap
italization of the service cost component. The requirements of the n ew standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginningafter December 15, 2017, and in
terim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019.In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requi
rements for accounting, presentation and classification of leases. This will result in most leasesbeing 
capitalized as a r ight of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard are effective forannual reporting periods beg
inning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020.We are in the process of 
implementing lease accounting software and analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financialposition. Based on our assessment 
to date, we expect this guidan ce will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the amount of ourlease commitments but we are
 unable to quantify the impact at this time.In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting require
ments for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Under the new guidance,companies will 
apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in anamount that reflec
ts the consideration for which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. The require ments of thenew standard and its subsequent am
endments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods withinthose annual periods, which for us is 
the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We will adopt th ese requirements using the cumulative effect approach. We haveevaluated and documented
 the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices and have not identified any material differencesresulting from applying th
e new requirements to our revenue contracts. Additionally, we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes,systems, and controls to support r
ecognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. This guidance will not h ave a material impact on ourresults of operations or f
inancial position.NON-GAAP 
MEASURES We have included in this r
eport measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures provide usefulinformation to 
investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors.

non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of  the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparabl
e GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management or the Board of Directors believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors 
and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addi
tion to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure.Organic Net 
Sales Growth Rates This measure is used in repor
ting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors’ measurement of our performance for incentive compensation pu
rposes. We provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. We believe that organicnet sales growth rates provid
e useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding theeffect that fore
ign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53 rd week, when applicable, have onyear-to-year 
comparability. A reconc iliation of these measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in our Consolidated Results of Operations and Resu

Profit and Total Segment Operating Profit as a Perc ent of Net SalesTotal segment operating p
rofit is used in reporting to our executive management and as a compon ent of the Board of Directors’ measurement of ourperformance for inc

Measures Our fiscal 2019 outlook for organi
c net sales growth and constant-currency total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude, o
r have otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability, including the effect of foreign currency exchange ratefluctuations, restruc
turing charges and project-related costs, acquisition integration costs, and commodity mark-to-market effects. Our fiscal 2019 out lookfor organic net sales growth 
also excludes the effect of acquisit ions and divestitures. We are not able to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures 
to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts be cause we are unable topredict with a reasonabl
e degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing ofacquisitions, divestitur
es and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2019. The unavai lable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2019GAAP financial results.
For fiscal 2019, we 
currently expect: fo reign currency exchange rates (based on blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions), acquisitions,and divestitures to incr
ease net sales growth by high single digits; foreign currency exchange rates to have an immaterial impact on adjusted o perating profitand adjusted diluted EPS growth; and res
tructuring charges and project-related costs related to actions previously announced to total approximately$13 million.

manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions, authorized under establishedpolicies that place 
clear controls on these activities. The counterparties  in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We establish credit limitsfor each counterparty. Our h

t risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level. The VAR calculation used historic
al interest and foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and corre
lation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics™ data set. The calculations are not intended torepresent actual loss
es in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the  derivative) inversely correlates with the underlyingexposure, we would expect that any loss o
r gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value ofthe 
underlying exposure. The positions included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodityswaps, futures, and options; and equity 
instruments. The calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and c ommodities or equity-relatedpositions that are offse
t by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.The table below presents the 
estimated maximum po tential VAR arising from a one-day loss in fair value for our interest rate, foreign currency, commodity,and equity market-risk
-sensitive instruments outstanding as of May 27, 2018 and May 28, 2017, and the average fa ir value impact during the year endedMay 27, 2018.

Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is 
responsible for these c onsolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internalcontrol over financial reporti
ng, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompany ing Item9a Management’s Report on Int
ernal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financialstatements and financial statement
 schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a publicaccounting firm regis
tered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in ac
cordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and ExchangeCommission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effectiveinternal control over financial
 reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the c
onsolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financialstatements, whether due to 
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,evidence regarding the 
amounts

Table of Contentsand disclosures in the consolid
ated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates madeby management, as well as ev
aluating the overall presentation of  the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reportingincluded obtaining an underst
anding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and ope
rating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other proceduresas we considered necessary in 
the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonabl e basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitat
ions of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of fi
nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal controlover financial repor
ting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance  of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairlyreflect the trans
actions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statement
s in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company arebeing made only in accordan
ce with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provid e reasonable assurance regarding preventionor timely detection of una
uthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree ofcompliance with the poli
cies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ KPMG LLP

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASS IFICATIONSBasis of Presentation
Our Consolidated Financial State
ments include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest.Intercompany transac
tions and accounts, including any noncontrolling and redeemable interests’ share of those transactions, are eliminated in consolidation.Our fiscal year ends on the l
ast Sunday in May.Certain 
reclassifications to our pre viously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period presentation.Change in 
Reporting Period As part of a long-term plan 
to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations, in fiscal 2017 we changed the reporting period of General Mills Brasil Alimentos Ltda (Yoki) within our Asia 
& Latin America segment from an April fiscal year-end to a May fiscal year-end to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, in fiscal 2017, our r
esults included 13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact of these changes was not material to ourconsolidated results of ope
rations. Our General Mills India business and Pet operating segment are on an April fis cal year end.In fiscal 2016 we changed the r
eporting period of Yoplait SAS and Yoplait Marques SNC within our Europe & Australia segment and Annie’s, Inc.(Annie’s) within our North Americ
a Retail segment from an April fiscal year-end to a May fiscal year-end to match our fiscal c alendar. Accordingly, infiscal 2016, our results inc
luded 13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact of these changes was not material to our consolidated resultsof operations.
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOU
NTING POLICIESCash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all 
investments purchased with an o riginal maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.Inventories
All inventories in the United St
ates other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. Grain inventoriesare valued at net realizable value
, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with all net changes in value recorded in earningscurrently.
Inventories outside of the Uni
ted States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realiz able value.Shipping 
costs associated with the dis tribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales, and are recognized when the relatedfinished product is shipped to and 
accepted by the customer.Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation
Land 
is recorded at histori cal cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost anddepreciated over estimated usef
ul lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charg ed to cost of sales. Buildingsare usually deprecia
ted over 40 years, and equipment, furniture, and software are usually depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets areretained in buildings and equ
ipment until disposal. When an item is sold o r retired, the accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciationand the resulting gains and loss
es, if any, are recognized in earnings. As of May 27, 2018, assets held for sale were insignificant.  
64

Table of ContentsLong-lived assets are rev
iewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asse t (or asset group)may not be recoverable. An i
mpairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of theasset group are less than th
e carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identi fiable cash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups.Measurement of an impa
irment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or 
independent appraisals, as appropriate.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is not subject to amort
ization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairmentmay have 
occurred. In fiscal 2016, we ch anged the date of our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment from the firstday of the third quarter 
to the first day of the second quarter to more closely align with the timing of our annual long-range planning p rocess. Impairmenttesting is performed fo
r each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit.Carrying value is based on the ass
ets and liabilities associ ated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared orcorporate items among reporti
ng units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, impairment has occurred. We recognize an impairment charge 
for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated tothe reporting unit. Our esti
mates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth ra tes for sales and profits are determinedusing inputs from our long-range p
lanning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, andother factors.
We evaluate the useful lives
 of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination onuseful life requires s
ignificant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (suchas the stability of the 
industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain o r changing regulatory environment, andexpected changes in distr
ibution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.Intangible assets that 
are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.Our indefinite-lived 
intangible assets, main ly intangible assets primarily associated with the Blue
Buffalo,
Pillsbury
 , Totino’s
, Progresso
, Yoplait
, Old
ElPaso
, Yoki
, Häagen-Dazs
, and Annie’s
brands, are also tested fo r impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that theircarrying value may not be 
recoverable. Our estimate of the fa ir value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which includedprojected revenues fro
m our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.Our finite-lived intangible
 assets, primarily acquired franchise agreements and customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever events orchanges in circumstanc
es indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimatedundiscounted future cash flows f
rom the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the carrying amount of the ass et. Assets generally haveidentifiable cash f
lows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amountof the asset over its fa
ir value. Fair value is measured using a dis counted cash flow model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Our investments in companies ov
er which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of undistributed earnings or losses. We receive royalty
 income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research and development), and record the tax impact ofcertain joint ventur
e operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we make advances to our joint v entures in the form of loans or capitalinvestments. We also sel
l certain raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices. 
65

Table of ContentsIn addition, we assess our investm
ents in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including, but no t limited to, as aresult of ongoing operating loss
es, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted average cost of capital, or significant business disruptions. Thesignificant assumptions used 
to estimate fair value include reven ue growth and profitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreigncurrency exchange rat
es, and a discount rate. By their nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the cur rent fair valueof our investment was less than 
the carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and writedown the investment to its fa
ir value if we concluded the impairment is oth er than temporary.Redeemable Interest
We have a 51 percent cont
rolling interest in Yoplait SAS, a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to pu
t all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December2024. This put option requires us to cl
assify Sodiaal’s interest as a redeemable inter est outside of equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long asthe put is exercisable by Sodi
aal. When the put is no longer exercisable, the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on ourConsolidated Balance Sheets. We 
adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Bal ance Sheetsquarterly to the redeemable intere
st’s redemption value, which approximates its fa ir value. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we adjusted theredeemable inter
est’s redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value includeprojected revenue growth and p
rofitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation, taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discountrate.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize sales revenue 
when the shipment is accept ed by our customer. Sales include shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and arereported net of consumer 
coupon redemption, trade promotion and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value-add
ed, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. Coupons are recorded when distributed, based on estimatedredemption rates. Trad
e promotions are recorded based on estimated participation and performance le vels for offered programs at the time of sale. Wegenerally do not allow a righ
t of return. However, on a limited case-by-case basis with prior approval, we may allow cus tomers to return product. In limitedcircumstances, product 
returned in saleable condition is resold to other customers or outlets. Receivables from customers generally do not bear interest.Terms and collection 
patterns vary around the world and by channel. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probablenon-payments 
and credit losses in our exis ting receivables, as determined based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Accountbalances are written o
ff against the allowance when we deem the amount is uncollectible.Environmental
Environmental costs rel
ating to existing conditions caused by pas t operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Liabilitiesfor anticipated re
mediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibi
lity studies or our commitment to a plan of action.Advertising Production Costs
We expense the production cos
ts of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.Research and Development
All expenditures for 
research and developmen t (R&D) are charged against earnings in the period incurred. R&D includes expenditures for new product andmanufacturing process innov
ation, and the annual expenditures are comprised primarily of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies att ributable toR&D activities. Other
 costs include depreciation and maintenance of research facilities, including assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities.

Table of ContentsForeign Currency Translation
For all significant foreig
n operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the period-end exchange rates. Income s
tatement accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments arereflected within accumulated ot
her comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included innet earnings for the per
iod, except for gains and losses on investments in subsidiaries for which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable future and foreign exchange gains and loss
es on instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI.Derivative Instruments
All derivatives are 
recognized on our Consolidated Bal ance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their fair value, and arerecorded in either cu
rrent or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are r ecorded in net earnings orother comprehensive inco
me, based on whether the instrument is designated and effective as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction.Gains or losses on derivative ins
truments reported in AOCI are reclass ified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlyinghedged transaction ceas
es to exist, any associated amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time. Any ineffectiveness is r ecognized inearnings in the current p
eriod.Stock-based Compensation
We generally measur
e compensation expense for grants of restricted stock units using the value of a share of our stock on the date of grant. We estimate thevalue of stock option grants using 
a Black-Scholes valuation model. Stock-based compensation is recognized straight line over the vesting period. Ourstock-based compensation exp
ense is recorded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and cost of sales in our Consol idated Statements ofEarnings and allocated to 
each reportable segment in our segment results.Certain 
equity-based compensation p lans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employeesand directors. We conside
r a stock-based award to be vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on prov iding subsequentservice. Accordingly,
 the related compensation cost is generally recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over theperiod from the grant da
te to the date retirement eligibility is achieved,  if less than the stated vesting period.We report the benefi
ts of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as an operating cash f low.Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Bene
fit, and Postemployment Benefit PlansWe sponsor several domesti
c and foreign defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired employees. Undercertain 
circumstances, we also prov ide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.We recognize an obliga
tion for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits th at do not vest or accumulate withservice (such as severan
ce based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plansare unfunded.
We recognize the under
funded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in the funded status inthe 
year in which the changes occur through AOCI.In fiscal 2018, we approved an am
endment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension pl ans that resulted inthe spinoff of a portion of th
e General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan(Grandfathered) (toge
ther, the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective M ay 31, 2018. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged.The result of the reorgan
ization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the Supplemental Retiremen
t Plan I (Grandfathered) (together, 
67

Table of Contentsthe Supplemental Plan
s I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility inevaluating opportunities 
to reduce risk and volatility. Actuaria l gains and losses associated with the Plan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over theaverage remaining se
rvice period of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan I and the Supplemental Plans I are amortized over the average rem
aining life of the participants. Please refer to Note 13 for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, andpostemployment benefit p
lans.Use of Estimates
Preparing our Consolidated 
Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to makeestimates and assumptions 
that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at th e date of the financialstatements, and the repo
rted amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include our accounting for promotionalexpenditures, valuation of 
long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable in terest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension,other postretirement benefit an
d postemployment benefit plans. Actual results could differ from our estimates.Other New Accounting Standards
In the third 
quarter of fiscal 2018, we adop ted new accounting requirements that codify Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff AccountingBulletin (SAB) No. 118, as it relates to 
allowing for recognition of provisional amounts related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the event that the accounting is not
 complete and a reasonable estimate can be made. Where necessary information is not available, prepared, or analyzed to determine areasonable estimat
e, no provisional amount should be recorded. The guidance a llows for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date tofinalize the accoun
ting related to the TCJA.In 
the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that provide the option to reclassify stranded income tax effects resulting fromthe TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. 
We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4 mill ion from AOCI to retainedearnings. This reclassif
ication consists of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceed the newly enacted federal corporate tax rate. The newaccounting requiremen
ts allow for adjustments to rec lassification amounts in subsequent periods as a result of changes to the provisional amounts recorded.In the first quarter of 
fiscal 2018, we adopted new requir ements for the accounting and presentation of stock-based payments. The adoption of this guidanceresulted in the prospect
ive recognition of realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards in our Consolidated Statements of Ea
rnings instead of additional paid-in capital within our Consolidated Balance Shee ts. We recognized a windfall tax benefit inincome 
tax expense in our Consolidated Sta tements of Earnings of $25.2 million in fiscal 2018. We retrospectively adopted the guidance related toreclassification o
f realized windfall tax benefits in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This resulted in reclassi fications of $25.2 million,$64.1 million, and $94.1 million of 
cash provided by financing activities to operating activities for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016, respectively.Additionally, we 
retrospectively adopt ed the guidance related to reclassification of employee tax withholdings in our Consolidated Statements of CashFlows. This resulted in reclassi
fications of $26.8 million, $37.8 million, and $40.3 million of cash used by operating activit ies to financing activities forfiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and f
iscal 2016, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures.In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities to measure a goodwill impairment loss by theamount by which a reporting unit
’s carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. Previously, goodwill impairment losses were required to bemeasured by determining 
the implied fair value of goodwill. Our annual goodwill impairment test was pe rformed as of the first day of the second quarter offiscal 2018, and the adoption of 
this guidance did not impact our results of operations or financial position. 
68

Table of ContentsIn the first quarter o
f fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements for the presentation of certain investments using the net ass et value, providing apractical expedien
t to exclude such investments from categorization within the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosure. We adopted the guidanceretrospectively and restated t
he fiscal 2016 fair value of plan asset tabl es in Note 13. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operationsor financial position.
In the first quarter 
of fiscal 2017, we adopted new accoun ting requirements which permit reporting entities with a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a 
month-end to apply a practical expedien t that permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity’s fiscal 
year-end and apply such practical expedient consistently to all plans. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact onour results of operations or 
financial position.In the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2016, we adopted new accounting requirements for the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, requiring noncurrentclassification for all deferred tax
 assets and liabilities on the statement of financial position. This presentation change has been implemented retroactively.The adoption of this guidance did no
t have a material impact on our financial position.In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2016, we adopted new accounting requirements for the classification of debt issuance costs presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction fro
m the carrying amount of the debt liability. This presentation change has been implemented retroactively. The adoption of this guidancedid not have a materia
l impact on our financial position.NOTE 3. ACQUISITI
ON AND DIVESTITURESOn April 24, 
2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (“Blue Buffalo”) for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion, including $103.0 million ofconsideration for net deb
t repaid at the time of the acquisition. In accordance with the definitive agre ement and plan of merger, a subsidiary of GeneralMills merged into Blue Buffa
lo, with Blue Buffalo surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of General Mills. In accordance with the mergeragreement, equity holde
rs of Blue Buffalo received $40.00 per sh are in cash. We financed the transaction with a combination of $6.0 billion in debt,$1.0 billion in equity, and cash on hand. Th
e acquisition accelerates our portfolio reshaping strategy. In fiscal 2018, we recorded acquisition t ransaction andintegration costs of $34.0 mi
llion recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses and $49.9 million in interest, net related to the debt issued tofinance the acquisition.
We consolidated Blue Buffalo 
into our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded goodwill of $5.3 billion, an indefinite lived intangible asset for the Blue Buffalo brand of $2.7 billion, and a 
finite lived customer relationship asset of $269.0 million. The goodwill was primarily attributable to future growthopportunities and any intangib
le assets that did not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is inc luded in the Pet reporting unit and is not deductiblefor tax purposes. We have conduc
ted a preliminary assessment of certain assets and liabilities related to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo. We are continuingour 
review of these items during the measurement period, and if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisitiondate, the acquisition a
ccounting will be revised to reflect the resulting adjustments to current estimates of these items. The consolidated results of Blu
e Buffalo will be reported as our Pet operating segment in future periods on a one-month lag. Accordingly, in fiscal 2018, our Consolidated Statements of E
arnings do not include Pet operating segment results.

brand intangible assets in restructuring, impai
rment, and other exit costs. Please see Note 6 for additional information.RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES
We view our restructuring 
activities as actions that hel p us meet our long-term growth targets. Activities we undertake must meet internal rate of return andnet present value targ
ets. Each restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each major stage is completed in thecase of multi-year programs),
 the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation. These activities result in various restructuring costs,including asset write-of
fs, exit charges including severance, contract termination fee s, and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciationassociated with restruc
tured assets, as used in the context of our disclosures regarding restructuring activity, refers to the increase in depreciation expense caused by shortening the useful 
life or updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approvedrestructuring plan. A
ny impairment of the asset is recognized immediately in the period the plan is approv ed.We are currently pursuing
 several multi-year restructuring initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business behind our key growth strategies. Charges reco
rded in fiscal 2018 related to these initiatives were as follows:

As a part of our ongoing 
operations, we are exposed to m arket risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity andequity prices. To manage th
ese risks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and swaps) pursuant to our established policies.
COMMODITY PRICE RISK
Many commodities we use in the p
roduction and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives to manage price riskfor 
our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and dieselfuel. Our primary object
ive when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of commodities purchased foruse in our supply chain. We manag
e our exposures through a combination of purchase orders, long-term contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded futuresand options, and 
over-the-counter options and swaps. We offset our exposur es based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek toacquire the inputs at as 
close to our planned cost as possible. We use derivatives to m
anage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve hedge accounting for commodity derivative pos
itions. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded currently in cost of sales in our ConsolidatedStatements of Earnings.
Although we do not meet the crit
eria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our objective of providingcertainty in the futu
re price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of measuring segment operating performancethese gains and losses are r
eported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating results until such time that the exposure we are managingaffects earnings. At tha
t time we reclassify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit, allowing our operating segments torealize the economic effects of 
the derivative without exp eriencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains  in unallocated corporate items.

f commodity derivatives was $238.8 million, of which $147.9 million related to agricul tural inputs and$90.9 million related to 
energy inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months.INTEREST RATE RISK
We are exposed to inter
est rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt, and existing and future issuances of floating-rate debt. Primaryexposures include U.S. Treasury rat
es, LIBOR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. We use interest rate swaps, forwa rd-starting interest r
ate swaps, and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve adesired proportion of
 fixed rate versus floating-rate debt, based on current and proj ected market conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with acounterparty to exchange 
the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.Floating Interest Rate Exposur
es — Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as c ash flow hedges, as are all hedges of forecasted issuances ofdebt. Effectiveness is a
ssessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present value of interest payments onthe underlying debt. Effec
tive gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified into earnings over the life of the associated debt. Ineffective gains andlosses are recorded as ne
t interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was a $2.6 million loss in fiscal 2018, and less than $1 million in fiscal 2017 and2016.
Fixed Interest Rate Exposures — 
Fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps ar e accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness assessed based on changesin the fair value of th
e underlying debt and derivatives, using increme ntal borrowing rates currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities.Ineffective gains and 
losses on these derivatives and the underlying hedged items are recorded as net interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was a $3.4 million loss in fiscal 2018, 
a $4.3 million gain in fiscal 2017, and less than $1 million in fiscal 2016.In 
advance of planned debt financing related to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, we entered into $3,800.0 million of treasury locks due April 19, 2018, withan average fixed rat
e of 2.9 percent, of which $2,300.0 million were entered into in the thi rd quarter of fiscal 2018 and $1,500.0 million were entered into inthe fourth quarter of f
iscal 2018. All of these treasury locks were cash settled for $43.9 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, concurrent with the issuance of our $850.0 million 
5.5-year fixed-rate notes, $800.0 mi llion 7-year fixed-rate notes, $1,400.0 mi llion 10-year fixed-rate notes, $500.0 mi llion20-year 
fixed-rate notes, and $650.0 m illion 30-year fixed-rate notes. In advance of planned debt f
inancing, in fiscal 2018, we entered into $500.0 million of treasury locks due October 15, 2017 with an average fixed rate of 1.8 percent. All of these tr
easury locks were cash settled for $3.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, concurrent with the issuance of our$500.0 million

Foreign currency fluctua
tions affect our net invest ments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases,intercompany loans, product sh
ipments, and foreign-denominated debt. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. Our principal exposur
es are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen,Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. We pr
imarily use foreign currency forward contracts to sel ectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures. Wealso generally swap our fore
ign-denominated commercial paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or thefunctional currency 
of the entity with foreign exchange exposure. The gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains orlosses recorded in earnings on 
the associated borrowings. We generally do not hedge more than 18 months in advance. As of May 27, 2018, the net notional value o
f foreign exchange derivatives was $899.5 million. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in each of fis
cal 2018, 2017, and 2016.

Table of ContentsWe also have many net inves
tments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We previously hedged a portion of these net investments byissuing euro-denominated co
mmercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts. As of May 27, 2018, we hedged a portion of these net investmentswith €2,200.0 million of euro denomin
ated bonds. As of May 27, 2018, we had deferred net for eign currency transaction losses of $142.3 million in AOCIassociated with net invest
ment hedging activity.EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
Equity price movements a
ffect our compensation expense as ce rtain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are revalued.We use equity swaps to manage th
is risk. As of May 27, 2018, the net notional amount of our equity swaps was $165.3 million. These swap contracts mature in fiscal 2019.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTIN
GENT FEATURESCertain of our derivativ
e instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from each of the major credit rating agencies. If o
ur debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization onderivative instruments in 
net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were ina liability position on May 27, 2018, was $7.2 
million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts. If the credit-risk-related contingent featuresunderlying these agreem
ents had been triggered on May 27, 2018, we would have been required to post $7.2 million of collateral to counterparties.

collateral. Under the terms of our swap agreements, some of our transactions require collateral or other securityto support financial inst

in a trust account that we may access if the counterparty defaults.We offer certain supp

ONTROLLING INTERESTSOur principal redeemab
le and noncontrolling interests relate to our Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté Marques Sàrl, and General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiaries. In addition, we have 4 
foreign subsidiaries that have noncontrolling interests totaling $12.6 million as of May 27, 2018.We have a 51 percent cont
rolling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests 
in each of the entities. On the acquisition date, we recorded the $904.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 49 percent euro-denominatedinterest in Yoplait SAS as a rede
emable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaa l has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interestto us at fair value once p
er year, up to three times before December 2024. We adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets qua
rterly to the redeemable interest’s redemption value, which approximates its fair value. Yoplait SAS pays dividendsannually if it meets 
certain financial metrics set forth in its shareholders agreement. As of May 27, 2018, the redemption value of the euro-denominatedredeemable inter
est was $776.2 million.On the acquisition dates, we re
corded the $281.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 50 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and 50 percent Canadian dollar
-denominated interest in Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Yoplait MarquesSNC earns a royalty stream through 
a licensing agreement with Yoplait SAS for the rights to 
Yoplait
  and related trademarks. Li berté Marques Sàrl earns aroyalty stream through l
icensing agreements with certain Yoplait group companies for the rights to 
Liberté
  and related tradema rks. These entities paydividends annually based on thei
r available cash as of their fiscal year end.We paid dividends of 
$37.7 million in fiscal 2018 and $48.6 million in fiscal 2017 to Sodiaal under the terms of the Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC,and Liberté Marques Sàrl sha
reholder agreements.A subsidiary of Yoplait SAS has entered into 
an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations with Sodiaal at market-determined pricesthrough 
July 1, 2021. Net purchases totaled $230.8 m illion for fiscal 2018 and $186.4 million for fiscal 2017.The holder of the GMC Class A 
Interests receives quarterly preferre d distributions from available net income based on the application of a floatingpreferred return rate to the h
older’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $251.5 million). On June 1,2015, the floating prefer
red return rate on GMC’s Class A interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points. The preferred re turnrate is adjusted every 
three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. On June 1, 2018,subsequent to our 
year-end, the floating prefer red return rate on GMC’s Class A Interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 142.5 basispoints.

We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4 million from AOCI to retainedearnings. Please see Note 14 for 
additional information.NOTE 11. STOCK PLANS
We use broad-based stock plans 
to help ensure that manag ement’s interests are aligned with those of our shareholders. As of May 27, 2018, a total of34.9 million shares were ava
ilable for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and shares of unrestrict ed stock under the2017 Stock Compensation Plan (2017 Plan). The 2017 Plan a
lso provides for the issuance of cash-settled share-based units, stock appreciation rights, andperformance-based sto
ck awards. Stock-based awards now outstanding include some grant ed under the 2007, 2009, and 2011 stock plans and the 2006 and2011 compensation plans for 
non-employee directors, under which no furth er awards may be granted. The stock plans provide for potentia l acceleratedvesting of awards upon retire
ment, termination, or death of eligible employees and directors.Stock Options
The estimated fair v
alues of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: 
 
  Fiscal Year   
  2018    2017    2016   
 Estimated fair valu
es of stock options granted  $ 6.18    $ 8.80    $ 7.24   Assumptions:
       Risk-free interest rate
   2.2 %     1.7%     2.4 %  Expected term
   8.2 years     8.5 years      8.5 years  Expected volatility
   15.8 %    17.8%     17.6 %  Dividend yield
   3.6 %     2.9%     3.2 %  
 We estimate the f
air value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock 
price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility usingthe historical volatility over
 the expected term of the option, excluding time per iods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude inestimating our stock pri
ce volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with 
tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility.Our 
expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercises andemployee terminat
ions within the valuation model. Separate 
91

Table of Contentsgroups of employees have simi
lar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected te
rm for all employee groups is presented in the tabl e above. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the optionsis based on the U.S. Treasury 
zero-coupon yield curve in effec t at the time of grant.Any corporate income tax ben
efit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfalltax benefit) is presen
ted in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall taxdeficiencies rel
ated to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Ea rnings.Options may be priced at 100 per
cent or more of the fair market value on the date of grant, and generally vest four years after the d ate of grant. Optionsgenerally expire within 10 y
ears and one month after the date of grant.Information on stock option a

 NOTE 13. RETIREMENT BENEF
ITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITSDefined Benefit Pension Plans
We have defined benefit 
pension plans covering many emp loyees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom. Benefits forsalaried employees a
re based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for e achyear of credited serv
ice. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made no voluntary contributions to our principalU.S. plans in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016. We do not expe
ct to be required to make any con tributions in fiscal 2019. Our principal domestic retirement plancovering salaried emp
loyees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within fiveyears of a change in contro
l. All salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013, are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a definedbenefit pension plan.
In fiscal 2018, we approved an am
endment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension plans that resulted inthe spinoff of a portion of th
e General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan(Grandfathered) (toge
ther, the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May 31, 2018. The benefits offered to th e plans’ participants were unchanged.The result of the reorgan
ization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and theSupplemental Retiremen
t Plan I (Grandfathered) (toge ther, the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investmentstrategy over time and 
to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan and the Su
pplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated withthe Plan I and the Supplementa
l Plans I are amortized over the average remaining life of t he participants.In May 2017, we announced changes to the Unit
ed States pension plans. The Company will freeze the pay and service amounts used to ca lculate pensionbenefits for active 
employees who participate in the United States 
94

Table of Contentspension plans as of December 31, 2027. Beginn
ing January 1, 2028, active employees in the United States will not accrue additional benefits for futureservice and eligible 
compensation received under these pl ans. These changes resulted in a $130.9 million decline in the projected benefit obligation as ofMay 28, 2017, due to the decrease in 
expected future compensation.Other Postretirement Bene
fit PlansWe also sponsor plans 
that provide health ca re benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The United States salaried healthcare benefit plan is 
contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund related trusts for c ertain employees andretirees on an annual bas
is. We made no voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2018 and $20.0 million in fiscal 2017.Health Care Cost Trend Rates
Assumed health care cost 
trends are as follows:  
 
  Fiscal Year   
  2018       2017   
 Health care cost trend 
rate for next year   6.7% and 7.0%        7.0% and 7.3%  Rate to which the cost trend r
ate is assumed to decline (ultimate rate)   4.5%        5.0%  Year that the rate reaches the
 ultimate trend rate   2029        2024   
 We review our health ca
re cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This 
information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions usedby other similar organi
zations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as nec essary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, andshort-term expecta
tions. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.0 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.7 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2018. Rat
es are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates areapplicable for calculations o
nly if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary,to approximate the current ec
onomic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an importa
nt effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.A one percentage point 
change in the health ca re cost trend rate would have the following effects:

 Postemployment Benefit Plans
Under certain circums
tances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, andMexico. 
We recognize an obliga tion for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulatewith service (such as sever
ance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemploy ment benefitplans are unfunded.

Table of ContentsIn the first quarter o
f fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities with a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a 
month-end to apply a practical expedient to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the en tity’s fiscalyear-end 
and apply such practical expedient consistently to all plans. We measured the plan assets and obligations for our defined benefit pension, o therpostretirement bene
fit, and postemployment benefit plans as of May 31, 2018, and May 31, 2017.Summarized

Beginning in fiscal 2017, we adopted the full yield curve method.Discount Rates
Beginning in fiscal 2017, we changed th
e method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for ourUnited 
States and most of our intern ational defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. We adopted a full yieldcurve approach to estim
ate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to det ermine the benefit obligation tothe relevant projec
ted cash flows. This method provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by correlating the timing of the plans’liability cash flows to th
e corresponding rate on the yi eld curve. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-averagediscount rate derived f
rom the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This change does not affect the measurement of our bene
fit obligations related to these plans. We have accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimatebeginning in the first quar
ter of fiscal 2017.Beginning in fiscal 2017, our discount 
rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefi
t plan obligations. We also use discount rates as of May 31 to determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit,and postemployment benefi
t plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our outside actuar ies to determine the timing and amountof expected future cash ou
tflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve,including a margin to tha
t index based on our credit risk. Th is forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine ourdiscount rate assumptions.

l changes in our level 3 investments in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets
Our expected rate 
of return on plan assets is de termined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of futurelong-term returns by asse
t class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflat ion assumptions. Wereview this assumption annual
ly for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantlyinfluence our evaluation.
Weighted-average ass
et allocations for the past two fiscal years for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension plan and otherpostretirement benefit plan p
ortfolios are broadly diversified across asset cla sses. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified acrossinvestment styles and inves
tment organizations. For the defined benefit pension plans, the long-term investment policy allocation is: 20 percent to equities in the United States;
 15 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities; 40 percent to fixed income; and 15 percent to real assets (real estate,energy, and infrastructu
re). For other postretiremen t benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 15 percent to equities in the UnitedStates; 10 percent to i
nternational equities; 5 percent to private equities; 65 percent to fixed income; and 5 percent to real as sets (real estate, energy, andtimber). The actual allocations
 to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.Contributions and Future Benefit Payments
We do not 
expect to be required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans infiscal 2019. Actual fisca
l 2019 contributions could exceed our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake disc retionary funding of ourbenefit trusts and future
 changes in regulatory requirements. Estimated benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expectedto be paid from fiscal 2019

lion relates to various state and foreign loss carryforwards, and $12.9 million relates to various foreign capital losscarryforwards. As 
of May 27, 2018, we believe it is more-likely-than-not that the remainder of our deferred tax assets are realizable.We have $174.1 million of tax 
loss carryforwards. Of this amount, $159.8 million is foreign loss carryforwards, $13.6 million is state operating loss carryforwards, and $0.7 mill
ion is federal operating loss carryforwards. The carryforward periods are as follows: $115.2 million do not expire; $6.0 millionexpire in fiscal 2019 and 2020; 
and $52.9 million expire in fiscal 2021 and beyond. On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA results 
in significant revisions to the U.S. corporate income tax system, includ ing areduction in the U.S. corporate 
income tax rate, implementation of a territorial system, and a one-time deemed repatriation tax on unt axed foreign earnings.The TCJA 
also results in a U.S. federal b lended statutory rate of 29.4 percent for us in fiscal 2018. Generally, the impacts of the new legislation would berequired to be recorded 
in the period of enactment which for us was the third quarter of fiscal 2018. However, Accounting Standards Update 2018-05: 
Income
Taxes
(Topic
740)
 (ASU 2018-05) was issued with guidance allowing for the recognition of provisional amounts in the event that the accounting isnot complete and a reason
able estimate can be made. The guidance allows for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to finalizethe accounting related to 
the TCJA. As of May 27, 2018, we have not completed our a
ccounting for the tax effects of the TCJA. During fiscal 2018, we recorded a provisional net benefit using reasonable estimat
es for those tax effects based on analysis and information available to date. The provisional net benefit is subject to revisions as wecomplete our analysis of 
the TCJA, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any addition al guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department,Internal Revenue Service, Fin
ancial Accounting Standards Board, and other standard setting and regulatory bodies. Adjustments may materially impact ourprovision for income 
taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. Our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will becompleted during the me
asurement period of up to one year from the enactment date.During fiscal 2018, we recorded an 
estimated net discrete benefit of $523.5 million. This net benefit consists primarily of a $637.5 million provisional deferred tax benefi
t from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate, partially offset by an $83.9 millionprovisional charge for th
e estimated transition tax and an additional $30.1 million provisional def erred tax liability related to changes in our assertion thatwe will reinvest unremit
ted foreign earnings indefinitely.Our estimate of the def
erred tax benefit due to the revaluation of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities is a provisional amount. Due to the newly enacted U.S. tax rate change, timing differe
nces that are estimated balances as of the date of enactment will result in changes to our estimate of the deferred rate changewhen those estimates are 
finalized with the filing of our fiscal 2018 income tax return. This is a result of the different federal income tax rates of29.4 percent and 21.0 percent fo
r fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, respectively. Since many of the deferred tax balances in the period of enactment includeestimates of 
events that have not yet oc curred, we are unable to determine the final impact of the tax rate change at this time.As of May 27, 2018, we have not 
recognized a deferr ed tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.4 billion from our foreign operationsbecause we currently bel
ieve our subsidiaries have invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings will be remit ted in atax-neutral 
transaction. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitelyreinvested. As a 
result of the TCJA, we are re-evaluating our assertion regarding th e indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings for most legal entitiesowned directly by our U.S. subsidiaries, and 
as such, we may need to accrue additional de ferred taxes related to any future changes in our assertion. As ofMay 27, 2018, we have recorded a provision
al estimate for local country withholding taxes related to certain entities from which we expect to repatriateundistributed earnings. However, we do not h
ave the necessary information gathered, 
103

Table of Contentsprepared and analyzed to
 make a reasonable estimate of any deferred taxes related to the rest of our foreign subsidiaries where we may change our indefinitereinvestment assert
ion. We will gather the information necess ary for those subsidiaries and record any new deferred taxes in future periods after the analysisis complete.
In general, the 
transition tax is a resu lt of the deemed repatriation imposed by the new legislation that results in the taxation of our accumulated foreignearnings and profits (E&P) a
t a 15.5 percent rate on liquid assets (i.e. cash and other specified assets) and 8 percent on the remaining unremitted foreignE&P, both net of foreign tax cr
edits. At this time, we have not yet gathered, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to complete the complexcalculations required to 
finalize the amount of our  transition tax. We believe that our provisional calculations result in a reasonable estimate of the transitiontax and related fore
ign tax credit, and as such have included those amounts in our provisional estimate in fiscal 2018. As we complete the analysis ofaccumulated foreign E
&P and related foreign taxes paid on an entity by entity basis and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets, we willupdate our provisional esti
mate of the transition tax and rel ated foreign tax credit in a future period.The legislation also inc
ludes provisions that will affect our fiscal 2019 results, including but not limited to, a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate ondomestic operations; th
e creation of a new minimum tax called the base erosion anti-abuse tax; a new provision that taxes U.S. allocated expenses as well ascurrently taxes 
certain income fro m foreign operations (Global Intangible Low Tax Income or GILTI); a new limitation on deductible interest expense; therepeal of the domestic manufact
uring deduction; and limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. While the new legislat
ion generally eliminates U.S. federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries going forward, certain income earned by certain subsidiaries 
must be included currently in our U.S. taxable income under the new GILTI inclusion rules. Because of the complexity of the newGILTI rules, we are evaluat
ing this provision and the application of U.S. GAAP. Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to make an accounting policy el ectionand record the taxes as a p
eriod cost as incurred or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. We have made an accounting policyelection to 
record these taxes as a p eriod cost.In addition, in fiscal 2018, we adop

(ASU 2018-02), 
which provides the option to rec lassify stranded income tax effects resulting from TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax 
effects of the TCJA of $329.4 million from AOCI to retained earnings. This reclassification consists of deferred taxes originallyrecorded in AOCI that exceed th
e newly enacted federal corporate tax rate. The new accounting requirements allow for adjustments to reclassificationamounts in subsequent periods as a 
result of changes to the provisional amounts recorded.We are subject to fed
eral income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before anuncertain tax position i
s audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particularuncertain tax position, we be
lieve that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjus t these liabilities, as well as the relatedinterest, in light of ch
anging facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash.The number of years with open tax 
audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the United States (federal andstate) and Canada. Various tax 
examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction,but are generally fro
m 3 to 5 years.Several state and fore
ign examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations to result in a material impact on our results ofoperations or financia
l position.

Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2017, the Intern
al Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of our federal tax returns for fiscal 2013 and 2014. Th e audit closureand related adjustmen
ts did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. In fiscal 2018, we recorded an adjustment related toa prior year which incre
ased income tax expense by $40.9 million. We h ave notified and are working with the IRS to resolve the issue. We determined theadjustment to be imma
terial to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018. We have effective ly settled all issues withthe IRS for fiscal years 2014 and p
rior.During fiscal 2017, the Brazil
ian tax authority, Secretaria da Recei ta Federal do Brasil (RFB), concluded audits of our 2012 and 2013 tax return years.These audits included a rev
iew of our determinations of amortization of certain goodwill arising from the acquisition of Yoki. The RFB has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate
 the goodwill amortization benefits related to this transaction. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend tocontest the disallowance.
We apply a 
more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognit ion and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of taxbenefit that has a greater tha
n 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expectedultimate resolution o
f uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change.The following table sets for
th changes in our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued inte rest, for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.Approximately $135 million of 
this total in fiscal 2018 represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax rate in futureperiods. This amount differs 
from the gross unreco gnized tax benefits presented in the table because certain of the liabilities below would impact deferredtaxes if recognized. W
e also would record a decrease in U.S. federal income taxes upon recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.

control over financia l reporting as of May 27, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control
–
Integrated
 Framework
(2013)
 . Under guidelines established by 
the SEC, companies are allowed to exclude an acquired business from management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 
for the first year subsequent to the acquisition. Accordingly, management has excluded the Blue Buffalo acquisition from its annualreport on internal cont
rol over financial reporting as of May 27, 2018. Blue Buffalo represents 29 per cent of the consolidated total assets and none of theconsolidated net sales of Gen
eral Mills, Inc as of and for the year ended May 27, 2018.Based on our assessment using the cr
iteria set forth by COSO in Internal
Control
–
Integrated
Framework
(2013)
 , management concluded th at our internal control over financia
l reporting was effective as of May 27, 2018.KPMG LLP, our independent registered public 
accounting firm, has issued a report on the effectivenes s of the Company’s internal control over financialreporting.

r Amendment Committee shall take into account the hardship that would be imposed on the Participant or Beneficiary by the payment offederal income tax
es under such circumstances.Section 3.9

changes in the Maximum Benefit after the date of t ermination of the Base Plan.Section 3.10 
Partial Prepayment . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan, partial prepayment of benefits may be made from time to time, pursuantto amendments to this Sect

 (a)  
 
(1)The first prepayment was au thorized to be made in January, 1988 to those active Participants who, on December 31, 1987, had earned vestedaccrued benefits under on
e or more Base Plans equal to the Maximum Benefit then in effect, payabl e at December 31, 1987, or age 55, if later. 
 
(2)The second prepayment was author ized to be made on or after October, 1988 and before December 31, 1988, to those active Participants whohad earned vested accru
ed benefits under one or more Base Plans, when projected to December 31, 1988, equal to the Maximum Benefit thenin effect, payable a
t December 31, 1988, or age 55, if later. 
 
(3)The third prepayment was autho rized to be made in December, 1989, to those active Participants who, if the Base Plans had continued ineffect through Decembe
r 31, 1989 as in effect on December 31, 1988, would have earned vested acc rued benefits under such Base Plans equalto the Maximum Benefit th
en in effect, payable at January 1, 1990, or at age 55 if later. 
 
(4)The fourth prepayment was autho rized to be made in October, 1990, to those active Participants who, if the Base Plans had continued in effectthrough December 31, 1990, as in eff
ect on December 31, 1988, would have earned vested acc rued benefits under such Base Plans equal to theMaximum Benefit then in e
ffect, payable at January 1, 1991, or at age 55 if later. 
 
(5)The fifth prepayment was au thorized to be made in December, 1991, to those active Participants who had earned vested accrued benefits underone or more Base Plans, when project
ed to December 31, 1991, equal to the Maximum Benefit then in e ffect, payable at December 31, 1991,or age 55, if later, but only 
to the extent that, when estimated benefits payable at each Participant’s normal retirement age were projected, theParticipant’s additional 
benefits payable from this  Plan at such normal retirement date were equal to or greater than zero. 
 
(6)The sixth prepayment was author ized to be made in December, 1992, to those active Participants who had earned vested accrued benefitsunder one or more Base Plans, when proje
cted to December 31, 1992, equal to the Maximum Benefit then in e ffect, payable at December 31,1992, but only to the extent that, when 
estimated benefits payable at each Participant’s normal retirement age (or announced early retirementage, if earlier) we
re projected, the Participant’s additional be nefits payable from this Plan at such retirement date were equal to or greater thanzero.
 
 
(b)For such Participants identi fied in (a) above who were eligible for a Normal or Early Retirement under the applicable Base Plan as of the stated dates,a monthly benefit payabl
e under this Plan was calculated as if (i) retirement actually occurred on the stated date, and (ii) the benefits payable under theapplicable Base Plans were pa
id under the normal form of payment provided in such Base Plans. The resulting benefit payable under the provisions of this Plan shall be calcul
ated as if payable in the form of an annuity for the life of such Participant. 
 
(c)For such Participants who are par ticipating in the Company’s Executive Incentive Plan but are not eligible for a Normal or Early Retirement under theapplicable Base Plans as of th
e stated date, a monthly benefit payable under this Plan is ca lculated under the provisions of Section 3.5 as if (i) such aParticipant’s involunta
ry termination occurred as of the stated date, and (ii) the benefit payable under the applicable Base Plan is paid under the normal form of payment p
rovided in such Base Plans. The resulting benefit payable under the provisions of this Plan shall be calculated as if payablein the form of an annuity pay
able for the life of such Participant.
 (d)The present value of the mon thly benefits payable under this Plan as calculated above shall be based on the immediate annuity interest ratesdetermined by the Pension Benef
it Guaranty Corporation as in effect on the January 1 of the year of any such authorized prepayment. 
 
(e)In the event the Compensation Com mittee, or its delegate, believes that payment of the entire present value of any amounts calculated pursuant to thisSection may result in an ove
rpayment of amounts that would have been payable under this Plan upon the actual retirement or separation from serviceof any of such Participants, withou
t regard to the provisions of this Section, the Compensation Committee, or its delegate, shall reduce the amount ofthe single sum 
payment as the Compensation Comm ittee, or its delegate, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.Section 3.11 
Adjustment for Prepayment . With respect to any Part icipant who received a prepayment of benefits under Section 3.10 above, the benefits dueupon Retirement, separat
ion or death under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5, or a subsequent prepayment of benefits du e under Section 3.10, shall be adjusted toreflect the prepay
ment of benefits in the following manner: 
 
(a) The monthly benefit payabl e under the applicable section shall be calculated first without regard to prepayment, under a life only form of payment. 
 
(b)The offset for each prep ayment shall be calculated based on a lump sum future value of the amount of the prepayment. Such amount will be calculatedusing the time period fro
m the stated date as of which the prepayment was calculated to the da te of the Participant’s retirement, separation, subsequentpayment date, or death, and 
an annual interest rate equal to 66.2% of the immediate annuity interest rate used to calculate the lump sum value of suchprepayment, on the 
after-tax value of the prepayment. Th e after-tax value of the prepayment sh all be based on an effective annual tax rate of 33.8%.This same rate shall 
be used to compute a before-tax value for offset purposes. The resulting lump sum future value is to be converted to a life annuityfigure using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortal
ity table for males. 
 
(c)The result in (b) above shal l be subtracted from (a) above after both figures have been adjusted for the appropriate form of benefit selected by theParticipant (or spouse, in th
e event of the Participant’s death). Th e result shall be the additional benefit remaining, if any, to be paid from this Plan. Inthe event of multiple prepa
yments for such a Participant, the offset for each prepayment shall be calculated separately and applied to the benefit in (a) above in the order in whi
ch paid. In the event the amount (or amounts in the event of multiple payments) determined in (b) above is equal to theamount determined in (
a) above, no additional benefits shall be payable under this Pl an. If the amount (or amounts in the event of multiple payments)determined in (b) above 
is greater than the amount determined in (a) above, the Company shall be entitled to recover the amount of any excessprepayments from the Par
ticipant and may withhold and retain sums which would otherwise be payable to the Participant under any other nonqualifiedplan of the Company in satisfa
ction of the excess prepayment.Section 3.12

been entitled if he or sh e voluntarily terminated services, without cause, with General Mills on December 31, 2004 and received apayment of said benefits on 
the earliest possible date allowed under the Plan, in the form of a single life annuity. For purposes of calcula ting the GrandfatheredBenefit the actual benefit comme
ncement date will be taken into account, but without regard to the actual form of payment elected, any further services renderedafter December 31, 2004, or 
any other event affec ting the amount or entitlement to benefits.For purposes of this Section 3.14, the pres
ent value of benefits is calculated using the in terest rate and mortality table applicable under Code section 417(e)as of December 31, 2004 (i.e., 4.74% in

inor Amendment Committee may approve or reject any such request in its sole disc retion.Any joint and survivor annuity shall b
e the actuarial equivalent of a single life annuity based on the following factors, det ermined using the ages of theParticipant and spouse on the e
ffective date of the payment:(a) For benefits 
commencing after Janu ary 1, 1989, the formula for the joint and 100% to survivor factor is:.868 + .005 (65 - X) + .005 (Y - X),

e Participant’sage and Y is equal to the age of 
the spouse.(b) For benefits commenc
ing on or before January 1, 1989, the formula for the joint and 100% to survivor factor is:.815 + .007 (63 - X) + .007 (Y - X), where X is equal to th
e Participant’sage and Y is equal to the age of 
the spouse.The formula for the join
t and 50% to survivor factor is:.898 + .004 (63 - X) + .004 (Y - X), where X is equal to th

ts are otherwise due, if, for any reason (including but not limited to, a change in the tax or revenue laws of the United States of America, a published ruling o
r similar announcement issued by the Internal Revenue Service, a regulation issued by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate,or a decision by a court of co
mpetent jurisdiction involving a Participant or Beneficiary), it believes that  a Participant or Beneficiary has recognized or willrecognize income for 
federal income tax purposes with respect to amounts that are or will be payable under the Plan before they are to be paid. In making thisdetermination, the Mino
r Amendment Committee shall take into account the hardship that would be imposed on the Participant or Beneficiary by the payment offederal income tax
es under such circumstances.Section 3.9 
Effect of Increases in the Maximum Benefit . In the event the dollar amount of the Maximum Benefit increases as a result of federal legislation, the benefits of any Parti
cipant payable under the Plan, whether or not in pay status, shall be recalculated to take into account the higher Maximum Benefit payablefrom the applicable Bas
e Plan. If payments have already commenced unde r the provisions of the applicable Base Plan and the Plan, benefit amounts under bothPlans shall be adjusted to re
flect the higher Maximum Benefit, by increasing the amount paid under the Base Plan and decreasing the amount paid under the Plan, as soon as administrative
ly possible after such a change. Notwithstanding the above, if a Base Plan is terminated, no adjustments shall be made to benefits payableunder the Plan with respect to 
changes in the Maximum Benefit after the date of t ermination of the Base Plan.Section 3.10 
Partial Prepayment . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan, partial prepayment of benefits may be made from time to time, pursuantto amendments to this Sect
ion. Prepayments so authorized are described as follows:
 (a)  
 
(1)The first prepayment was au thorized to be made in January, 1988 to those active Participants who, on December 31, 1987, had earned vestedaccrued benefits under on
e or more Base Plans equal to the Maximum Benefit then in effect, payabl e at December 31, 1987, or age 55, if later. 
 
(2)The second prepayment was author ized to be made on or after October, 1988 and before December 31, 1988, to those active Participants whohad earned vested accru
ed benefits under one or more Base Plans, when projected to December 31, 1988, equal to the Maximum Benefit thenin effect, payable a
t December 31, 1988, or age 55, if later. 
 
(3)The third prepayment was autho rized to be made in December, 1989, to those active Participants who, if the Base Plans had continued ineffect through Decembe
r 31, 1989 as in effect on December 31, 1988, would have earned vested acc rued benefits under such Base Plans equalto the Maximum Benefit th
en in effect, payable at January 1, 1990, or at age 55 if later. 
 
(4)The fourth prepayment was autho rized to be made in October, 1990, to those active Participants who, if the Base Plans had continued in effectthrough December 31, 1990, as in eff
ect on December 31, 1988, would have earned vested acc rued benefits under such Base Plans equal to theMaximum Benefit then in e
ffect, payable at January 1, 1991, or at age 55 if later. 
 
(5)The fifth prepayment was au thorized to be made in December, 1991, to those active Participants who had earned vested accrued benefits underone or more Base Plans, when project
ed to December 31, 1991, equal to the Maximum Benefit then in e ffect, payable at December 31, 1991,or age 55, if later, but only 
to the extent that, when estimated benefits payable at each Participant’s normal retirement age were projected, theParticipant’s additional 
benefits payable from this  Plan at such normal retirement date were equal to or greater than zero. 
 
(6)The sixth prepayment was author ized to be made in December, 1992, to those active Participants who had earned vested accrued benefitsunder one or more Base Plans, when proje
cted to December 31, 1992, equal to the Maximum Benefit then in e ffect, payable at December 31,1992, but only to the extent that, when 
estimated benefits payable at each Participant’s normal retirement age (or announced early retirementage, if earlier) we
re projected, the Participant’s additional be nefits payable from this Plan at such retirement date were equal to or greater thanzero.
 
 
(b)For such Participants identi fied in (a) above who were eligible for a Normal or Early Retirement under the applicable Base Plan as of the stated dates,a monthly benefit payabl
e under this Plan was calculated as if (i) retirement actually occurred on the stated date, and (ii) the benefits payable under theapplicable Base Plans were pa
id under the normal form of payment provided in such Base Plans. The resulting benefit payable under the provisions of this Plan shall be calcul
ated as if payable in the form of an annuity for the life of such Participant. 
 
(c)For such Participants who are par ticipating in the Company’s Executive Incentive Plan but are not eligible for a Normal or Early Retirement under theapplicable Base Plans as of th
e stated date, a monthly benefit payable under this Plan is ca lculated under the provisions of Section 3.5 as if (i) such aParticipant’s involunta
ry termination occurred as of the stated date, and (ii) the benefit payable under the applicable Base Plan is paid under the normal form of payment p
rovided in such Base Plans. The resulting benefit payable under the provisions of this Plan shall be calculated as if payablein the form of an annuity pay
able for the life of such Participant.
 (d)The present value of the mon thly benefits payable under this Plan as calculated above shall be based on the immediate annuity interest ratesdetermined by the Pension Benef
it Guaranty Corporation as in effect on the January 1 of the year of any such authorized prepayment. 
 
(e)In the event the Compensation Com mittee, or its delegate, believes that payment of the entire present value of any amounts calculated pursuant to thisSection may result in an ove
rpayment of amounts that would have been payable under this Plan upon the actual retirement or separation from serviceof any of such Participants, withou
t regard to the provisions of this Section, the Compensation Committee, or its delegate, shall reduce the amount ofthe single sum 
payment as the Compensation Comm ittee, or its delegate, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.Section 3.11 
Adjustment for Prepayment . With respect to any Part icipant who received a prepayment of benefits under Section 3.10 above, the benefits dueupon Retirement, separat
ion or death under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5, or a subsequent prepayment of benefits du e under Section 3.10, shall be adjusted toreflect the prepay
ment of benefits in the following manner: 
 
(a) The monthly benefit payabl e under the applicable section shall be calculated first without regard to prepayment, under a life only form of payment. 
 
(b)The offset for each prep ayment shall be calculated based on a lump sum future value of the amount of the prepayment. Such amount will be calculatedusing the time period fro
m the stated date as of which the prepayment was calculated to the da te of the Participant’s retirement, separation, subsequentpayment date, or death, and 
an annual interest rate equal to 66.2% of the immediate annuity interest rate used to calculate the lump sum value of suchprepayment, on the 
after-tax value of the prepayment. Th e after-tax value of the prepayment sh all be based on an effective annual tax rate of 33.8%.This same rate shall 
be used to compute a before-tax value for offset purposes. The resulting lump sum future value is to be converted to a life annuityfigure using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortal
ity table for males. 
 
(c)The result in (b) above shal l be subtracted from (a) above after both figures have been adjusted for the appropriate form of benefit selected by theParticipant (or spouse, in th
e event of the Participant’s death). Th e result shall be the additional benefit remaining, if any, to be paid from this Plan. Inthe event of multiple prepa
yments for such a Participant, the offset for each prepayment shall be calculated separately and applied to the benefit in (a) above in the order in whi
ch paid. In the event the amount (or amounts in the event of multiple payments) determined in (b) above is equal to theamount determined in (
a) above, no additional benefits shall be payable under this Pl an. If the amount (or amounts in the event of multiple payments)determined in (b) above 
is greater than the amount determined in (a) above, the Company shall be entitled to recover the amount of any excessprepayments from the Par
ticipant and may withhold and retain sums which would otherwise be payable to the Participant under any other nonqualifiedplan of the Company in satisfa
ction of the excess prepayment.Section 3.12

to additional benefits und er this Plan as described below. In addition to any benefits that such a Participant may be entitled to underthe provisions of this Articl
e III, this Plan shall also pay the difference, if any, between the total benefits the Participant is ent itled to from the Base Plan in whichhe or she is participat

ted to a Participant’s “Grandfathered Benefit”. Each Participant’s Grandfathered Benefit shall equal the present value of the benefit towhich the Participant would have 
been entitled if he or sh e voluntarily terminated services, without cause, with General Mills on December 31, 2004 and received apayment of said benefits on 
the earliest possible date allowed under the Plan, in the form of a single life annuity. For purposes of calcula ting the GrandfatheredBenefit the actual benefit comme
ncement date will be taken into account, but without regard to the actual form of payment elected, any further services renderedafter December 31, 2004, or 
any other event affec ting the amount or entitlement to benefits.For purposes of this Section 3.14, the pres
ent value of benefits is calculated using the in terest rate and mortality table applicable under Code section 417(e)as of December 31, 2004 (i.e., 4.74% in
