ITEM 1.
BUSINESS GENERAL
Pfizer Inc. is a research
-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend andsignificantly i
mprove their lives through the discovery, development and manufacture of healthcare products. Our global portfolio includes medicines andvaccines, as well a
s many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products. We work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness,prevention, treatments and cures that chal
lenge the most feared diseases of our time. We collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and localcommunities to support and expand acce
ss to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. Our revenues are derived from the sale of our products and, to amuch lesser extent, from al
liance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered or developed by other companies or us. The majority of ourrevenues come from the manufacture and sale of b
iopharmaceutical products. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June2, 1942.
We believe that our medic
ines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but alsofrom a reduction in o
ther healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. Wecontinue to actively engage in d
ialogues about the value of our medicines and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treatdisease and improve ou
tcomes. We continue to work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements andcontracting methods with
 payers, to maximize patient access and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. We remain firmly committed to fulfilling ourcompany’s purpose of innovating to b
ring therapies to patients that extend and significantly improve their lives. By doing so, we expect to create value for thepatients we serve and
 for our shareholders.We are committed to ca
pitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as throughvarious forms of business 
development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions,mergers and acquisitions. 
We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhanceshareholder value by pursuing a d
isciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities.On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our g
lobal infusion therapy net assets, HIS, to ICU Medical for up to approximately $900 million, composed ofcash and contingent cash considerat
ion, ICU Medical common stock and seller financing. HIS includes IV pumps, solutions and devices. Under the terms of theagreement, we received
 3.2 million newly issued shares of ICU Medical common stock, which we valued at approximately $430 million (based upon the closingprice of ICU Medical common stock
 on the closing date less a discount for lack of marketability), a promissory note from ICU Medical in the amount of $75million and net cash of approx
imately $200 million before customary adjustments for net working capital. In addition, we are entitled to receive a contingentamount of up to an additional $225 mil
lion in cash based on ICU Medical’s achievement of certain cumulative performance targets for the combined companythrough December 31, 2019. After receipt of the I
CU Medical shares, we own approximately 16.4% of ICU Medical as of the closing date. We have agreed tocertain restrictions on t
ransfer of our ICU Medical shares for 18 months. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 2B. Acquisitions, Assets and Liabilities Held 
for Sale, Licensing Agreements, Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements, Equity-MethodInvestments and Cost-M
ethod Investment: Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale in our 2016 Financial Report. On December 22, 2016, which fal
ls in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 for our international operations, we acquired the development and commercialization rightsto AstraZeneca’s small molecule 
anti-infectives business, primarily outside the U.S., including the commercialization and development rights to the newlyapproved EU drug Zavicefta™ (cefta
zidime-avibactam), the marketed agents Merrem™/Meronem™ (meropenem) and Zinforo™ (ceftaroline fosamil), and theclinical develop
ment assets aztreonam-avibactam and ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam. Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment ofapproximately $550 mil
lion to AstraZeneca upon the close of the transaction and will make a deferred payment of $175 million in January 2019. In addition,AstraZeneca is eligible to rec
eive up to $250 million in milestone payments, up to $600 million in sales-related payments, as well as tiered royalties on sales ofZavicefta™ and aztreonam-avibacta
m in certain markets.On September 28, 2016, we acquired Medivat
ion for approximately $14.3 billion in cash ($13.9 billion, net of cash acquired). Medivation is now a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of Pfizer. Medivation
 is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small molecules for oncology. Medivation’sportfolio includes Xtand
i (enzalutamide), an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells,and two development-stage oncology as
sets. Xtandi is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration between Pfizer and Astellas. Astellas hasexclusive commerc
ialization rights for Xtandi outside the U.S. For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 2A. Acquisitions, Assets and Liabilities Held

imately $4.9 billion in cash ($4.5 billion net of cash acquired), plus $698 million debt assumed. Anacor is now awholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. An

rategy and our business development initiatives, see the Overview of Our Performance, Ope rating Environment, Strategy andOutlook 
— Our Strategy — Our Business Development Initiatives section in our 2016 Financial Report. Our businesses are heavil
y regulated in most of the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., the principal authority regulating our operations is the FDA. TheFDA regulates the safety and efficac
y of the products we offer and our research, quality, manufacturing processes, product promotion, advertising and productlabeling. Simi
lar regulations exist in most other countries, and in many countries the government also regulates our prices. In the EU, the EMA regulates thescientific evaluat
ion, supervision and safety monitoring of our products, and employs a centralized procedure for approval of drugs for the EU and the European
Economic Area countries. In Japan, the PMDA is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviewsand pharmaceutical saf
ety. Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority, suchas the FDA or EMA, before they begin to condu
ct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. For additional information, see theGovernment Regulation 
and Price Constraints section below. Note:

TABLE OF CONTENTSCOMMERCIAL OPERATIONS
We manage our commercial o
perations through two distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH), which waspreviously known as E
stablished Products. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, we reorganized our operating segments to reflect that we now manage ourinnovative pharmaceutica
l and consumer healthcare operations as one business segment, IH .  From the beginning of our fiscal year 2014 until the secondquarter of 2016, these operations were managed as t
wo business segments: the Global Innovative Products segment and the Vaccines, Oncology andConsumer Healthcare segmen
t. We have revised prior-period information to reflect the reorganization. The IH and EH operating segments are each led by asingle manager. Each o
perating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain IPR&D projects for new investigational products andadditional indication
s for in-line products that generally have achieved proof of concept. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed andemerging markets.
Some additional information
 about our business segments follows:Pfizer Innovative Health

TABLE OF CONTENTSRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Innovation by our R&D organi
zation is very important to our success. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market innovative products that address majorunmet medical needs.
Our R&D Operations
We conduct R&D internally and 
also through contracts with third parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and incooperation with other
 pharmaceutical firms. Our R&D spending is conducted through a number of matrix organizations. Our WRD organization is generallyresponsible for research pro
jects for our IH business until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the IH segment via the GPDorganization, which was forme
d in early 2016, for possible clinical and commercial development.The GPD organization is a ne
w, unified center for late-stage development for our innovative products. GPD is expected to enable more efficient and effectivedevelopment and enhance our ability to a
ccelerate and progress assets through our pipeline. GPD combines certain previously separate development-relatedfunctions from the IH business and the 
WRD organization to achieve a development capability that is expected to deliver high-quality, efficient, and well-executed clinical prog
rams by enabling greater speed, greater cost efficiencies, and reduced complexity across our development portfolio.The WRD and GPD organizations
 also have responsibility for certain science-based and other end-to-end platform-services organizations, which providetechnical expertise and 
other services to the various R&D projects, including EH R&D projects. These organizations include science-based functions (which arepart of our WRD organizatio
n), such as Pharmaceutical Sciences, Medicinal Chemistry, Regulatory and Drug Safety. As a result, within each of these functions,we are able to migrate resource
s among projects, candidates and/or targets in any therapeutic area and in most phases of development, allowing us to reactquickly in response to evolving
 needs.We continue to strengthen our global 
R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&D to achieve asustainable pipeline that 
will deliver value in the near term and over time. For additional information regarding our R&D operations, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environ
ment, Strategy and Outlook — Our Strategy — Research and Development Operations and Costs and Expenses — Researchand Development (R&D) Expenses 
— Description of Research and Development Operations sections in our 2016 Financial Report.Our R&D Priorities and Strategy
Our R&D priorities include delivering a pip
eline of differentiated therapies and vaccines with the greatest medical and commercial promise, innovating newcapabilities that can positio
n Pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation andproductivity. To that end, our research p
rimarily focuses on:•
Biosimilars;•
Inflammation and Immunology;•
Metabolic Disease and Cardiovascular Risks;•
Neuroscience;•
Oncology;•
Rare Diseases; and•
Vaccines.We also seek out promising c
hemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery anddevelopment processes or proje
cts, as well as our product lines, by entering into collaborations and alliance and license agreements with other companies, aswell as leveraging a
cquisitions and equity- or debt-based investments. These agreements enable us to co-develop, license or acquire promising compounds,technologies or capabil
ities. We also enter into agreements pursuant to which a third party agrees to fund a portion of the development costs of one or more ofour pipeline products in ex
change for rights to receive potential milestone payments, revenue sharing payments, profit sharing payments and/or royalties.Collaboration, all
iance, license and funding agreements and equity- or debt-based investments allow us to share risk and cost and to access external scientificand technological expertise, and enab
le us to advance our own products as well as in-licensed or acquired products.Our R&D Pipeline and Competition
Innovation is critica
l to the success of our company, and drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. According to thePharmaceutical Benchmar
king Forum, out of 20 compounds entering preclinical development, only one is approved by a regulatory authority in a major market(U.S., the EU or Japan). The proces
s from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years. Drug candidates canfail at any stage of the process, and candidate
s may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research and development.As of January 31, 2017, we had the follow
ing number of projects in various stages of R&D:

Development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While these drug candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatoryapproval, new drug candidates enter
ing clinical development phases are the foundation for future products. In addition to discovering and developing newproducts, our R&D efforts seek to add 
value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness, enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering potential newindications for them.
Information concerning severa
l of our drug candidates in development, as well as supplemental filings for existing products, is set forth in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—
Product Developments — Biopharmaceutical section in our 2016 Financial Report, which is incorpora ted by reference.Our competitors also devote substant
ial funds and resources to R&D. We also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developingpotential drug candidates. The extent to wh
ich our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products andpotential sales of products in de
velopment, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate without large R&Dexpenses and make a regular practi
ce of challenging our product patents before their expiration. For additional information, see the Competition and Item 1A.Risk Factors

TABLE OF CONTENTSINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
We have significant operat
ions outside the U.S. Operations in developed and emerging markets are managed through our two business segments: IH and EH.Emerging markets are an impo
rtant component of our strategy for global leadership, and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and risingeconomic power of the fastest-gro
wing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets.We sell our products in o
ver 125 countries. Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $26.5 billion accounted for 50% of our total revenues in 2016 . Japan is our largest national ma
rket outside the U.S. For a geographic breakdown of revenues, see the table captioned Geographic Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statem

Our international operations are 
subject, in varying degrees, to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries. These include, among otherthings, currency fluctuation
s, capital and exchange control regulations, expropriation and other restrictive government actions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Affecting Internation
al Operations below. Our international businesses are also subject to government-imposed constraints, including laws and regulationson pricing, reimbursement, and a
ccess to our products. See Government Regulation and Price Constraints — Outside the United States below for a discussion of these matters.
Depending on the direction of change re
lative to the U.S. dollar, foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets andresults of operations. Whi
le we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us, we attempt to mitigatetheir impact through operational 
means and by using various financial instruments, depending upon market conditions. For additional information, see the Notesto Consolidated Financial St

In our global biopharmaceutica
l businesses, we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients. Through our marketing organizations, we explain theapproved uses, benefits and risks of ou
r products to healthcare providers, such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists; MCOs thatprovide insurance coverage, su
ch as hospitals, Integrated Delivery Systems, PBMs and health plans; and employers and government agencies who hire MCOsto provide health benefits to their emp
loyees. We also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer advertising that seeks tocommunicate the approved uses, benefits and 
risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, wesponsor general advertising to edu
cate the public on disease awareness, prevention and wellness, important public health issues, and our patient assistanceprograms.

TABLE OF CONTENTSOur prescription pharmace
utical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies andpharmacies, and, in t
he case of our vaccines products in the U.S., we primarily sell directly to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wholesalers andindividual provider offices. We se
ek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and MCO formularies, which are lists of approved medicinesavailable to members of the M
COs. MCOs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formulary products, to drive utilization of products in preferredformulary positions. 
We also work with MCOs to assist them with disease management, patient education and other tools that help their medical treatmentroutines.
In 2016, our top three biopharmaceutical 
wholesalers accounted for approximately 39 % of our total revenues (and approximately 76 % of our total U.S.revenues).

Our global Consumer Healthcar
e business uses its own sales and marketing organizations to promote its products, and occasionally uses distributors andagents, principally in smaller markets
. The advertising and promotions for our Consumer Healthcare business are generally disseminated to consumers throughtelevision, print, digital and
 other media advertising, as well as through in-store promotion. Consumer Healthcare products are sold through a wide variety ofchannels, including distributors
, pharmacies, retail chains and grocery and convenience stores. Our Consumer Healthcare business generates a significantportion of its sales from se
veral large customers, the loss of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the Consumer Healthcare business.PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Our products are sold around the wor
ld under brand-name, logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider, in the aggregate, to be of materialimportance to Pfizer. Trademar
k protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and, in other countries, for as long as it is registered.Registrations generally are f
or fixed, but renewable, terms.We own or license a number of 
U.S. and foreign patents. These patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses, pharmaceutical formulations,product manufacturing processes and 
intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing.Patents for individual produ
cts extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countrieswhere patent protection is obtained. The actua
l protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, thescope of its coverage and the availab
ility of legal remedies in the country. Further, patent term extension may be available in many major countries tocompensate for a regulatory delay 
in approval of the product. For additional information, see Government Regulation and Price Constraints — IntellectualProperty 
below. In the aggregate, our patent and related rights are of mater
ial importance to our businesses in the U.S. and most other countries. Based on current productsales, and considering the v
igorous competition with products sold by our competitors, the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our businessas a whole, togeth
er with the year in which the basic product patent expires (including, where applicable, the additional six-month pediatric exclusivity periodand/or the granted patent term extension), are those for the med
icines set forth in the table below. Patent term extensions, supplementary protection certificatesand pediatric exclusi
vity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below, unless they have been granted by the issuing authority. Insome instances, there are later-e
xpiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions, to methods of manufacturing, or to use ofthe drug in the treatment of particular d
iseases or conditions. However, in some cases, such patents may not protect our drug from generic or, as applicable,biosimilar compet
ition after the expiration of the basic patent.Drug

(1)In addition to the basic product patent covering Viagra , which expired in 2012, Viagra is covered by a U.S. method-of-treatment patent which, including the six-month pediatric exclusivity period associated with 
Revatio (which has the same active ingredient as Viagra ), expires in 2020. However, as a result of a patent litigation settlement, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. will be allowed to launch a generic version of 
Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017, or earlier under certain circumstances. The corresponding method-of-treatment patent covering 
Viagra in Japan expired in May 2014. (2)

Eucrisa is not approved in the EU and Japan. (8)
Xtandi is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Astellas, who has exclusive commercialization rights for Xtandi outside the U.S. A number of our current products have exper
ienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years. Foradditional information, 
including a description of certain of our co-promotion agreements and their expiration dates, and a further discussion of our productsexperiencing, or expected to exper
ience in 2017, patent expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S., Europe or Japan, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environ
ment, Strategy and Outlook — Our Operating Environment — Industry-Specific Challenges — Intellectual Property Rights andCollaboration/Licensing Rights 
section in our 2016 Financial Report and Item 1A. Risk Factors — Dependence on Key In-Line Products below. Companies have filed appl
ications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patents; these includecandidates that would compete w
ith, among other products, Xeljanz and Xtandi . For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 17A1. Commitments and Contingencies—Legal Proceedings—Patent Litigation in our 2016 Financial Report. The expiration of a basic product patent or 
loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from genericproducts against the original
ly patented product and can result in a significant reduction in revenues for that product in a very short period of time. In somecases, however, we can continue to obta
in commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets; patents on uses for products; patents on processesand intermediates for the economica
l manufacture of the active ingredients; patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms; orconversion of the active ingred
ient to OTC products.Biotechnology Products
Our biotechnology pro
ducts, including BeneFIX , ReFacto , Xyntha and Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada), may face in the future, oralready face, competitio
n from biosimilars (also referred to as follow-on biologics). In the U.S., such biosimilars would reference biotechnology productsapproved under the U.S. Public 
Health Service Act. Additionally, the FDA has approved a follow-on recombinant human growth hormone that referenced ourbiotechnology product, 
Genotropin , which was approved un der the FFDCA.Biosimilars a
re versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and tohave no clinically meaningful diff
erences. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to biologic medicines. Abbreviated legalpathways for the approval of bios
imilars exist in certain international markets and, since the passage in 2010 of the ACA, a framework for such approval exists inthe U.S. The regulatory imple
mentation of these ACA provisions is ongoing, and, since 2015, the FDA approved a number of biosimilars, including Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb). Pfizer has exclusive commercializatio
n rights to Inflectra from Celltrion Inc. and Celltrion He althcare, Co., Ltd. (collectively, Celltrion) in theU.S., Canada and cer
tain other territories. Pfizer also shares Inflectra commercialization rights with Celltrion in Europ e. For additional information on Inflectra , see the 
Analysis of the Consol idated Statements of Income –– Revenues –– Selected Product Descriptions –– Inflectra/Remsima section in our 2016 Financial Report. For additional in
formation on the ACA’s approval framework for biosimilars, see Government Regulation and Price Constraints — Biosimilar Regulationbelow.
In Europe, the European Commiss
ion has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specificguidelines for biosi
milar approvals issued over the past few years. In 2013, the EMA approved the first biosimilar of a monoclonal antibody, and in January 2016,the European Commission a
pproved an etanercept biosimilar referencing Pfizer’s Enbrel . In Japan, the regulatory authority has granted ma rketingauthorizations for cert
ain biosimilars pursuant to a guideline for biosimilar approvals issued in 2009.If competitors are able to obtain mar
keting approval for biosimilars that reference our biotechnology products, our biotechnology products may become subjectto competition from t
hese biosimilars, with attendant competitive pressure, and price reductions could follow. Expiration or successful challenge of applicablepatent rights could 
trigger this competition, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. However, biosimilar manufacturing is complex. At least initiallyupon approval of 
a biosimilar competitor, biosimilar competition with respect to biologics may not be as significant as generic competition with respect to smallmolecule drugs.
As part of our business strategy, 
we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing, as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths, to developbiosimilar medicines. As such, a be
tter-defined biosimilars approval pathway will assist us in pursuing approval of our own biosimilar products in the U.S. SeeItem 1A. Risk Factors 
— Biotechnology Products below. We may face litigation 
with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products. Likewise, as we develop and manufacturebiosimilars and see
k to launch products, patents may be asserted against us.International
One of the main limitations on ou
r operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products. Underinternational and U.S. free trade agree
ments in recent years, global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving. For additional information, seeGovernment Regulation 
and Price Constraints — Intellectual Property below. COMPETITION
Our businesses are conducted in 
intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition inthe form of branded or generic drugs or bio
similars that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease ofuse, and cost effectiveness. Though the means of compet
ition vary among product categories and business groups, demonstrating the value of our products is a
critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses.Our competitors include o
ther worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus,generic and biosimi
lar drug manufacturers and consumer healthcare manufacturers. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products thattreat diseases or indicatio
ns similar to those treated by our major products.This competition affects our co
re product business, which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medicalneeds and provide 
therapeutic improvements. Our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&D, as well as our businessdevelopment transactions, both designed to 
result in a strong product pipeline. Our investment in research does not stop with drug approval; we continue toinvest in further understanding the va
lue of our products for the conditions they treat, as well as potential new applications. We seek to protect the health andwell-being of patients by 
striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated topatients, physicians and globa
l health authorities. We also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions,including coordinating 
support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers.Pfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSOperating conditions have become mo
re challenging under mounting global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue totake measures to evaluate, adapt and improve ou
r organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs. We believe that we havetaken an industry-leading ro
le in evolving our approaches to U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising; interactions with, and payments to, healthcare professionals;and medical education grants. We a
lso continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers, as we strive to advance fundamentalhealth system change through support for better hea
lthcare solutions.Our Consumer Healthcare bus
iness faces competition from OTC business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies, andretailers who carry the
ir own private label brands. Our competitive position is affected by several factors, including the amount and effectiveness of our and ourcompetitors’ promotiona
l resources; customer acceptance; product quality; our and our competitors’ introduction of new products, ingredients, claims, dosageforms, or other forms of innovation; and p
ricing, regulatory and legislative matters (such as product labeling, patient access and prescription to OTC switches).Our vaccines business ma
y face competition from the introduction of alternative or next generation vaccines. For example, Prevnar 13 may face competition inthe form of alternative 13-valent or add
itional valent next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to the expiration of its patents, which may adverselyaffect our future results.
Our generics and biosimilars busin
esses compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers. Globally,Pfizer sells generic versions of Pfizer’s,
 as well as certain competitors’, solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products, as well as biosimilars. Weseek to maximize the op
portunity to establish a “first-to-market” or early market position for our generic injectable drugs and biosimilars, as a “first-to-market”position provides customers 
a lower-cost alternative immediately when available and also may provide us with a period of exclusivity as the only generic orbiosimilar provider.
Managed Care Organizations
The evolution of managed care in the U.S. ha
s been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 283 million peoplein the U.S. now have some form of hea
lth insurance coverage. Due to the expansion of health insurance coverage (see Government Regulation and PriceConstraints 
— In the United States below), the marketing of presc ription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in theU.S. continues to grow in
 importance.The influence of MCOs has inc
reased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the same time, thoseorganizations have been consol
idating into fewer, even larger entities. This consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate, as well as their importance toPfizer.
The growth of MCOs has increased p
ressure on drug prices as well as revenues. One objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce healthcareexpenditures. MCOs typically ne
gotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies (which are lists of approved medicines available to membersof the MCOs), clinica
l protocols (requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one ormore generic products before perm
itting access to a branded medicine), volume purchasing, long-term contracts and their ability to influence volume and marketshare of prescription drugs. In add
ition, by placing branded medicines on higher-tier status in their formularies (leading to higher patient co-pays) or non-preferred tier status, MCOs tran
sfer a portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient, resulting in significant out-of-pocket expenses for the patient, especiallyfor chronic treatments. This f
inancial disincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the MCOs. MCOshave recently introduce
d additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing, and value-based pricing/contracting toimprove their cost contain
ment efforts. We are closely monitoring these new approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them.Due to their generally lower c
ost, generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of MCO formularies. The breadth of the products covered byformularies can vary con
siderably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particularmedical problems. In 2015, the FD
A approved the first biosimilar and MCOs are evaluating the appropriate placement of these new agents on their formularies.Exclusion of a product from a for
mulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population.Consequently, pharmaceutica
l companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products. Unique product features, such as greater efficacy, betterpatient ease of use, or fewer side effects, a
re generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies. However, lower overall cost of therapy is also an importantfactor. We have be
en generally, although not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO formularies. However, increasingly ourbranded products are being placed on the higher t
iers or in a non-preferred status.MCOs also emphasize pr
imary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to managecosts. Hospitalizat
ion and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, arePfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTScarefully managed. Since the use of 
certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization, professional therapy, or even surgery, such drugs can becomefavored first-line treatme
nts for certain diseases.The ACA has accelerated
 payment reform by distributing risk across MCOs and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality whilereducing costs, which creat
es pressure on MCOs to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes. In 2017, there likely will be federal legislative and administrativeefforts to repeal, substantiall
y modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. We are monitoring any such actions to see if any changes to the ACAwill be enacted that would
 impact our business.Generic Products
One of the biggest competitive chal
lenges that our branded products face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Upon the expiration or loss of patentprotection for a product, especial
ly a small molecule product, we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. Severalcompetitors make a regular pra
ctice of challenging our product patents before their expiration. Generic competitors often operate without large R&D expenses,as well as without co
sts of conveying medical information about products to the medical community. In addition, the FDA approval process exempts genericsfrom costly and time-consu
ming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data ofthe innovator product. Generic compet
itors do not generally need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of our product after the expirationor loss of our patent and often charge much les
s.In addition, our patent-protected products can face 
competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity.As noted above, MCOs that focus prima
rily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage theuse of generics as alt
ernatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in somecases require, pharmacist
s to substitute, for brand-name drugs, generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically andtherapeutically equiva
lent to brand-name drugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution.RAW MATERIALS
Raw materials essential to our 
businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these materials areavailable from multiple sources. No
 serious shortages or delays of raw materials were encountered in 2016 , and none are expected in 2017 . We have successfully secured the 
materials necessary to meet our requirements where there have been short-term imbalances between supply and demand, butgenerally at higher prices 
than those historically paid.GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS
Pharmaceutical companie
s are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which they do business. Certain laws andregulations that gov
ern Pfizer’s business are discussed below.General 
. Our business has been and will continue to be subject to numerous laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, includingthose governing the manufacture and marketing of ou
r products, could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by various governmentalbodies. For additional infor
mation on these proceedings and actions, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 17A. Commitments and Contingencies—Legal Proceedin
gs in our 2016 Financial Rep ort. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, warning letters and product recalls orseizures, as well as limitations on o
ur ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from such proceedings and actions.In the United States
Drug Regulation 
. In the U.S., biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulations by the FDA, including regulations thatgovern the testing, manufacturing, safety, eff
icacy, labeling and storage of our products, record keeping, advertising and promotion. Our products are alsosubject to post-market
 surveillance under the FFDCA and its implementing regulations with respect to drugs, as well as the Public Health Service Act and itsimplementing regulations with res
pect to biologics. The FDA also regulates our Consumer Healthcare products.Other U.S. federal agencies, in
cluding the DEA, also regulate certain of our products. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has the authority to regulate theadvertising of consumer health
care products, including OTC drugs and dietary supplements. Many of our activities also are subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC.Before a new biopharmaceutica
l product may be marketed in the U.S., the FDA must approve an NDA for a new drug or a BLA for a biologic. The steps requiredbefore the FDA will approve
 an NDA or BLA generally include preclinical studies followed by multiple stages of clinical trials conducted by the study sponsor;sponsor submission of the appl
ication to the FDA for review; the FDA’s review of the data to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness; and the FDA’sinspection of the f
acilities where the product will be manufactured.Before a generic dru
g may be marketed in the U.S., the FDA must approve an ANDA. The ANDA review process typically does not require new preclinical andclinical studie
s, because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the referenced drug previously approved through the NDAprocess. The ANDA proces
s, however, does require the sponsor to conduct one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent tothe previously approved referenced b
rand drug, submission of an application to the FDA for review, and the FDA’s inspection of the facilities where the productwill be manufactured.
As a condition of product approval, the F
DA may require a sponsor to conduct post-marketing clinical studies, known as Phase 4 studies, and surveillanceprograms to monitor the effect of the approved product. The F
DA may limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-market studies andprograms. Any modifications 
to a drug or biologic, including new indications or changes to labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require thesubmission and approval of a ne
w or supplemental NDA or BLA before the modification can be implemented, which may require that we develop additional dataor conduct additional 
preclinical studies and clinical trials. Our ongoing manufacture and distribution of drugs and biologics is subject to continuing regulation bythe FDA, including record
keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product, and adherence to cGMPs, which regulate allaspects of the manufacturing process. 
We are also subject to numerous regulatory requirements relating to the advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics,including, but not limited 
to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirementsgoverning the manu
facture and marketing of our products may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls orseizures, injunctions, fines, civil pe
nalties and/or criminal prosecution.Biosimilar Regulation. 
The ACA created a fr amework for the approval of biosimilars (also known as follow-on biologics) following the expiration of 12 years ofexclusivity for the innovator
 biologic, with a potential six-month pediatric extension. Under the ACA, biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four years
after the approval of the reference, innovator biologic.The FDA is responsible for implem
entation of the legislation and, since 2015, approved a number of biosimilars, including Inflectra . Through those approvals and the issuance of draft and final guidance, the F
DA has begun to address open questions about the naming convention for biosimilars and the use of datafrom a non-U.S.-licensed com
parator to demonstrate biosimilarity and/or interchangeability with a U.S.-licensed reference product. Over the next several years,the FDA is expected t
o issue additional draft and final guidance documents impacting biosimilars. In 2017, there likely will be federal legislative andadministrative efforts to
 repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. If the ACA is repealed, substantially modified, orinvalidated, it is unclear what
, if any, impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation.Sales and Marketing 
. The marketing practices of U.S. biopharmaceutical companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that areintended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare 
industry and protect the integrity of government healthcare programs. These laws include anti-kickbacklaws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws ge
nerally prohibit a biopharmaceutical company from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration togenerate business, inclu
ding the purchase or prescription of a particular product. False claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willinglypresenting, or causing to be presented, any c
laims for payment for goods (including drugs) or services to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid)that are false or fraudulent. Although the spec
ific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance orcourt decisions that a
pply the laws to any particular industry practices, including the marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies. Violations of fraud andabuse laws may be punish
able by criminal or civil sanctions and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). The federalgovernment and various states have al
so enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies. The laws and regulationsgenerally limit f
inancial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require disclosure to the federal or state government and public of suchinteractions; and/or require the adopt
ion of compliance standards or programs. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or requireadministrative guidance fo
r implementation. Individual states, acting through their attorneys general, have become active as well, seeking to regulate themarketing of prescription 
drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, ouractivities could be sub
ject to the penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations.Pricing and Reimbursement 
. Pricing for our pharmaceutical products depends in part on government regulation. Pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebateson purchases of pharmaceutical produ
cts under various federal and state healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the “federal ceilingprice” drug pricing prog
ram, the 340B drug pricing program and the Medicare Part D Program. Pfizer must also report specific prices to government agenciesunder healthcare programs, such as the Med
icaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported arecomplex and the failure to report pr
ices accurately may expose Pfizer to penalties. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income 
— Revenues — Overview section in our 2016 Financia l Report and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 1G. Basis of Presentation an
d Significant Accounting Policies: Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable in our 2016 Financial Report, which are incorporated byreference.
Government and private third-party pa
yers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products. For example, the majority of states usepreferred drug lists to restr
ict access to certain pharmaceutical products under Medicaid. Restrictions exist for some Pfizer products in certain states. As anotherexample, access to our products under the 
Medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans with which state Medicaid agenciescontract to provide s
ervices to Medicaid beneficiaries. Given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises, a growing number of states areconsidering a variety of co
st-control strategies, including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments. Inaddition, we expect that consol
idation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers, who are the primary purchasers of our pharmaceutical products inthe U.S., will increase competitive 
and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us.Healthcare Reform. 
The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pa ss legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry. In March 2010, theU.S. Congress enacted the ACA, 
which included changes that significantly affected the pharmaceutical industries, such as:•
increasing drug rebates paid to state Medicaid programs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for brand name and generic prescription drugs andextending those rebates to Medicaid managed 
care;•
requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide discounts on brand name prescription drugs sold to Medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drugcosts cause the beneficiarie
s to be subject to the Medicare Part D coverage gap; and•
imposing an annual fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, includingMedicare and Medicaid.
The ACA included provisions desig
ned to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance. Specifically, since 2014, the ACA has required mostindividuals to mainta
in health insurance coverage or potentially to pay a penalty for noncompliance and has offered states the option of expanding Medicaidcoverage to additional indi
viduals. The implementation of the coverage expansion had a negligible impact on Pfizer’s 2016 revenues.The ACA also establishe
s an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending by proposing changesto Medicare payments if expenditu
res exceed certain targets. The threshold for triggering IPAB proposals was not reached in 2016, so no adjustments will bemade under the IPAB until 2019 at the earl
iest. If no IPAB members are nominated, the duties of the IPAB will default to the Secretary of the Department ofHealth and Human Services.
Additionally, efforts by g
overnment officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products could adverselyaffect our business if imp
lemented. There has recently been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to addressthe perceived high cost of pharmaceut
icals. We believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliverto the overall healthcare syste
m. We continue to work with stakeholders to ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system.Adoption of other new legislat
ion at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. In 2017, we may face uncertaintiesbecause there likely will be fed
eral legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA.There is no assurance that the ACA, as 
currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannotpredict how future f
ederal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. We will continue to actively workwith law makers and advo
cate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes and lower costs to the healthcare system.Anti-Corruption. 
The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreigngovernment official, government 
staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPAincludes interactions with certain
 healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.Outside the United States
We encounter similar regulatory
 and legislative issues in most other countries.
New Drug Approvals and Pharmacovigilance. In the EU, the approval of new drugs may be a chieved using the Mutual Recognition Procedure, the DecentralizedProcedure or the EU Central
ized Procedure. These procedures apply in the EU member states, plus the European Economic Area countries, Norway, Icelandand Liechtenstein. The Centrali
zed Procedure, managed by the EMA, results in one single authorization for the whole EU which provides the most rapid andefficient means of gaining approva
l across the EU and is the one most commonly used for new products.In Japan, the PMDA is the point of entry fo
r businesses looking to sell drugs in the country. The PMDA, which is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities,including clin
ical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceuticals safety, must approve an application before a new drug product may bemarketed in Japan. 
The PMDA also offers consultations on clinical trials of new drugs and provides advice on product classifications and approvals.Health authorities in man
y middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of theFDA or the EMA) before
 they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. Many authorities also require local clinical datain the country’s population 
in order to receive final marketing approval. These requirements delay marketing authorization in those countries relative to the U.S.and Europe.
China’s regulatory system is uniqu
e in many ways, and its drug development and registration requirements are not always consistent with U.S. or otherinternational standards. It is 
common to see treatments entering the Chinese market two to eight years behind first marketing in the U.S. and Europe, becausehistorically 
China has only issued import drug licenses to treatments approved by a foreign regulatory authority. In addition, to obtain marketing approvals fornew drugs in China, a clinical trial a
uthorization issued by the CFDA is required for the conduct of Phase I to III clinical trials. Foreign applicants of importeddrugs, if including China-originat
ed data in their Multi-Regional Clinical Trials and meeting the relevant technical review requirements, may receive case-by-caseadditional local clinical trial waivers. Oral gen
erics, on the other hand, only need to undergo bioequivalence studies upon a filing for record with the CFDA, whilesterile injectable generics may n
eed local confirmatory trials for regulatory approval. A Chinese drug license will only be granted if, following review, the CFDAdetermines that the clinica
l data confirm the drug’s safety and effectiveness.In the EU, there is detailed leg
islation and guidance on pharmacovigilance, which has been increased and strengthened in recent years. The EMA’sPharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee
 has the responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the EUauthorities. EU regulator
s may require pharmaceutical companies to conduct post-authorization safety and efficacy studies at the time of approval, or at any timeafterwards in light of sc
ientific developments. There are also additional extensive requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additionalmonitoring of products. Outside deve
loped markets such as the EU and Japan, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive, butthere is a trend t
oward increasing regulation.Pricing and Reimbursement 
. In Europe, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and some other international markets, governments provide healthcare at lowdirect cost to consumers and regu
late pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system,particularly under recent g
lobal economic pressures. Governments, including the different EU Member States, may use a variety of cost-containment measuresfor our pharmaceutical products, 
including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing, and international reference pricing (i.e., the practice of manycountries linking the
ir regulated medicine prices to those of other countries). This international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditionsand assessments of value across 
countries has led to different prices in different countries and some third-party trade in our products between countries.In particular, internationa
l reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation. Pricevariations, exacerbated by inte
rnational reference pricing systems, also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations. The downward pricing pressure resultingfrom this dynamic can be expected to 
continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies and measures targeting pharmaceuticals in someEuropean countries.
In addition, several impor
tant multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD), are increasing policy pressures
 and scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations (e.g., 2016 UN High Level Panel Report on
 Access to Medicines , and 2017 OECD Report on New Healt h Technologies — Managing Access, Value and Sustainability ). Government adoption of these recommendations 
may lead to additional pricing pressures.In Japan, the government recently released a ba
sic framework for pharmaceutical pricing that may lead to the adoption of cost effectiveness assessments andpricing reviews. In 
China, government-set price caps were lifted for the vast majority of drug products on June 1, 2015. However, the government continues toexercise indirect pr
ice control by setting reimbursement standards through a negotiation mechanism between drug manufacturers and social insuranceadministrations. In addit
ion, the CFDA is now asking some companies to enter into pricing commitments as a condition for regulatory approval.EU Regulatory Changes 
. The EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation in May 2014, which is expected to come into effect by October 2018. This newregulation is aimed at simplifying 
and harmonizing the governance of clinical trials in the EU and will require increased public posting of clinical trial results.In another eff
ort to increase the public availability of clinical trial results, the EMA adopted a new policy on Publication of Clinical Data for Medicinal Products forHuman Use, which became ef
fective January 1, 2015 and is now being actively implemented. Under this policy, the EMA now proactively publishes clinical trialdata from application dossie
rs for new marketing authorizations, including data from trials taking place outside the EU, after the EMA has made a decision on themarketing authorization.
 The policy includes limited exceptions for commercially confidential information and the exclusion of any protected personal data.Brexit 
. In June 2016, the U.K. electorate voted in a referendum to leave the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. At present, it is unclear whether theU.K. will remain within, or affiliated to
, the EU system of medicines approval and regulation, or separate itself completely. Immediately following Brexit, EU lawsare expected to continue to apply until a
mended or repealed by the U.K. Parliament. It is however probable that the EMA, currently in London, will have torelocate to an EU member state, many of 
which have already bid to become the new host country. For additional information on Brexit, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity an
d Capital Resources — Global Economic Conditions — U.K. in our 2016 Financial Report . China Regulatory Changes 
. In an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce the existing drug approval backlogs, the CFDA unveiled several reforminitiatives for Ch
ina’s drug approval system. The regulator now divides drugs into new drugs and generics, with the definition for new drugs changed from “drugsnever marketed in China” to “d
rugs that are neither marketed in or outside China.” This change in definition creates more incentives for China’s domestic drugmanufacturers than for multinationa
l firms, because imported drugs first marketed outside China are no longer considered new drugs. Furthermore, the revisedrules do not clarify wheth
er foreign regulatory approval is still required for imported drug final approval in China. Another major initiative is the piloting of the“marketing authorization ho
lder” system in ten provinces in China, where the market authorization/drug license holders are no longer required to be the actualmanufacturers. The
 “marketing authorization holder” system will allow for more flexibilities in contract manufacturing arrangements and asset transfers, but it isnot applicable to imported drugs.
A number of other policy changes are e
xpected to be able to streamline and accelerate domestic and imported drug approvals in China. These changes includeintroducing an umbrella clinical trial a
uthorization for all three phases of registration studies (instead of the original phase-by-phase approvals), implementing afiling/recordation sy
stem for bioequivalence studies on generics (instead of the original review and approval system), and admitting more types of drugs asinnovative drugs elig
ible for the fast track/green channel approval pathway.
Healthcare Provider Transparency and Disclosures. A number of countries  have implemented laws requiring (or their industry associations have recommended)disclosure of transfers of va
lue made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers. For example, in 2013, the EFPIA released its disclosure code oftransfers of value to healthcare profes
sionals and organizations. The code requires all members of EFPIA, including Pfizer, to disclose transfers of value tohealthcare professionals and hea
lthcare organizations beginning in 2016, covering the relevant transfers in 2015.Intellectual Property 
. The World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (WTO-TRIPS) required participant countriesto amend their intellectual p
roperty laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005, with an extension until 2033 for least-developedcountries. While we 
still face patent grant, enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world, a number of countries have madeimprovements. We inc
lude stronger patent protection among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries.While the global intellectual pro
perty environment has improved following WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our future business growthdepends on further progress in intel
lectual property protection. In emerging market countries in particular, governments have used intellectual property policiesas a tool for reducin
g the price of imported medicines, as well as to protect their local pharmaceutical industries. There is considerable political and economicpressure to weaken existing 
intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection, which has led to policies such as more restrictivestandards for obtaining patents and more diff
icult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions(e.g., new medical treatment methods
), revocation of patents, issuance (and threat of issuance) of compulsory licenses, weak intellectual property enforcementand failure to implement effect
ive regulatory data protection. Our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreignmanufacturers, as well as 
on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries.Canada’s intellectua
l property regime for drugs provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity (eight years plus six-month pediatric extension), butit lacks the predictabi
lity and stability that otherwise comparable countries provide. Through intense negotiations as part of the Canada/EU ComprehensiveEconomic & Trade Agreement, Canad
ian authorities reluctantly agreed to introduce a right of appeal, a form of patent term restoration and to elevate the currentdata protection to a treaty obligation, furthe
r aligning its intellectual property regime to the EU.In China, the intellectual p
roperty environment has improved, although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern. Thegovernment has tak
en steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with World Trade Organization provisions, and several companies, includingPfizer, have established R&D ce
nters in China due to increased confidence in China’s intellectual property environment. Despite this, China remained on theU.S. Trade Representative’
s Priority Watch List for 2016. Further, the standards for patentability in China remain more restrictive than in other major markets,including the U.S., Europe and Japan. 
Also, while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years, enforcement mechanisms are often lacking orinconsistent. For example, the absen
ce of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions, impractical evidentiary burdens, and heightenedsufficiency standards have been used to 
invalidate patents at the enforcement stage.In Brazil and other L
atin American countries, the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents (e.g., National Health Surveillance Agency in Brazil),restrictive patentabil
ity rules, ambiguity regarding the term of certain patents and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products throughpatents. The lack of regulatory data protect
ion and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions, such as new medical uses of drug products, may limit thecommercial lifespan of some p
harmaceutical products.In India, policies favor
ing compulsory licensing of patents, the increasing tendency of the Indian Patent Office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in oppositionproceedings (both pre- and post-grant), and re
strictive standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to safeguard many of ourinventions and our investments 
in innovation. These policies heighten the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovative pharmaceutical products,especially in areas pe
rceived as being important to the public health of the population. Challenges against Pfizer patents in India are ongoing.In South Korea, the laws and regulation
s for the patent-regulatory approval linkage system was implemented as part of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement in2012. The Korean patent-regulatory approval 
linkage system includes biologics.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Most of our operations are affected by nationa
l, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expendituresnecessary for compliance with 
applicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. See the Notesto Consolidated Financial St
atements— Note 17A3. Commitments a nd Contingencies—Legal Proceedings—Commercial and Other Matters in our 2016 Financial Report. As a re
sult, we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2016 for environmental compl iance purposes and for the clean-up of certainpast industrial activity as follows:
•
environment-related capital expenditures— $27 million; and•
other environment-related expenses— $126 million.While capital expenditures or 
operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have amaterial effect on o
ur capital expenditures or competitive position.Climate change presents r
isks to our operations, including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs, and the potential for morefrequent and severe weather events and water ava
ilability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers. We cannot provide assurance thatphysical risks to our facilities and s
upply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future; however, we have a program for reviewing our vulnerability tothese potential risks and we update ou
r assessments periodically. To date, we have concluded that, because of our facility locations, our existing distributionnetworks and our controls, we do not ant
icipate that these risks will have a material impact on Pfizer in the near term.TAX MATTERS

Section 219 of Ira
n Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (ITRSHRA) requires disclosure by public companies of certain transactions involvingthe Government of Iran, as well as ent
ities and individuals designated under Executive Order 13382 and Executive Order 13224 (the Executive Orders). In some
instances, ITRSHRA requires companies to disclose these types of transactions, even if they were permissible under U.S. law or were conducted by a non-U.S.affiliate in accordance with 
the local law under which such entity operates.As a global biopharmaceu
tical company, we conduct business in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world. During 2016 , our activities included sup plying life-saving medicines, med

: MANAGED CARE TRENDS
Consolidation among MCOs has
 increased the negotiating power of MCOs and other private insurers. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments,increasingly employ formularies to c
ontrol costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain or maintain timely oradequate pricing or formulary p
lacement for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue. Inaddition to formulary tier 
co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been raising co-payments required frombeneficiaries, particu
larly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. This cost shifting has given consumers greater control of medicationchoices, as they pay for a larger po
rtion of their prescription costs and may cause consumers to favor lower cost generic alternatives to brandedpharmaceuticals. MCOs have r
ecently introduced additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing, and value-basedpricing/contracting to improv
e their cost containment efforts. Private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools,such as clinical p
rotocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or moregeneric products before permitt
ing access to a branded medicine. As the U.S. payer market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in genericform, biopharmaceutical co

TABLE OF CONTENTSpricing pressure from private
 third-party payers, who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives.GENERIC COMPETITION
Competition from manufacturer
s of generic drugs is a major challenge for our branded products around the world, and the loss or expiration of intellectualproperty rights can have a sign
ificant adverse effect on our revenues. The date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that thepatent or regulatory exclusi
vity expires. However, upon the loss or expiration of patent protection for one of our products, or upon the “at-risk” launch (despitepending patent infringement lit
igation against the generic product) by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products, we can losethe major portion of revenues for that product 
in a very short period of time, which can adversely affect our business. A number of our products are expected toface significantly increased g
eneric competition over the next few years.Also, generic manufacturers ha
ve filed applications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patents;these include candidates that wou
ld compete with, among other products, Xeljanz and Xtandi . Our licensing and collabor ation partners also face challenges bygeneric drug manufacturers to patents cove
ring several of their products that may impact our licenses or co-promotion rights to such products. In addition, ourpatent-protected products may face competit
ion in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity.COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS
We cannot predict with accu
racy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products, including new product entrants, in-line branded products,generic products, private labe
l products, biosimilars and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs anddrug candidates. The introduction of compet
itive products can result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products indevelopment, as well as unant
icipated product obsolescence. Competitive product launches have occurred in recent years, and certain potentially competitiveproducts are in various stages of de
velopment, some of which have been filed for approval with the FDA and with regulatory authorities in other countries.We also produce generic 
and biosimilar pharmaceutical products that compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generic and biosimilarmanufacturers. The ability to 
launch a generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before anticipated generic or biosimilar market formation is important tothat product’s profit
ability. Prices for products typically decline, sometimes dramatically, following generic market formation, and as additional companies receiveapprovals to market that product, compet
ition intensifies. If a company’s generic or biosimilar product can be “first-to-market” such that its only competition is thebranded drug for a period of time, higher 
levels of sales and profitability can be achieved until other generic or biosimilar competitors enter the market. Withincreasing competition in th
e generic or biosimilar product market, the timeliness with which we can market new generic or biosimilar products will increase inimportance. Our success will dep
end on our ability to bring new products to market quickly.DEPENDENCE ON KEY IN-LINE PRODUCTS
We recorded direct product revenue
s of more than $1 billion for each of eight biopharmaceutical products: Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 , Lyrica , Enbrel , Ibrance , Lipitor 
, Viagra , Sutent and the Premarin family of products, as well as  more than $1 billion in Alliance revenues (primarily Eliquis ) in 2016. Those products and Alliance revenues accounted fo
r 43% of our total revenues in 2016. If these products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problemssuch as loss of patent protection (
if applicable), changes in prescription growth rates, material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, regulatoryproceedings, publicity affe
cting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing competitive products, changes in labeling or, if a new, more effectivetreatment should be introduced, the adverse 
impact on our revenues could be significant. Patents covering several of our best-selling medicines have recentlyexpired or will expire in the nex
t few years (including some of our billion-dollar and previously billion-dollar products), and patents covering a number of our best-selling medicine
s are, or have been, the subject of pending legal challenges. For example, pursuant to terms of a settlement agreement, certain formulations ofZyvox 
became subject to generic compet ition in the U.S. in January 2015. In addition, our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate ofcommercial acceptance of ke
y new products. For additional information, see the Overview of Our Performance, Ope rating Environment, Strategy and Outlook –– Our Operating Environment

TABLE OF CONTENTSRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT
The discovery and development of safe, effect
ive new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for thecontinued strength of our businesses. Our p
roduct lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their marketexclusivity, as 
well as to provide for earnings growth. Our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or newindications for exist
ing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers, either through internal R&D or throughcollaborations, acquis
itions, joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties. However, balancing current growth, investment for future growthand the delivery of shareholder retu
rn remains a major challenge. The average costs of product development continue to rise, as do the regulatory requirementsin many therapeutic areas, wh
ich may affect the number of candidates funded as well as the sustainability of the R&D portfolio. Our ongoing investments in newproduct introductions and in R
&D for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth.Additionally, our R
&D investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets, and failure to invest in the right technologyplatforms, therapeutic segments, produ
ct classes, geographic markets and/or in-licensing and out-licensing opportunities in order to deliver a robust pipelinecould adversely impact the p
roductivity of our pipeline. Further, even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified, the science may not workfor any given program despite the s
ignificant investment required for R&D, and the commercial potential of the product may not be as competitive as expectedbecause of the highly dynamic ma
rket environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement.We continue to strengthen our global 
R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&D to achieve asustainable pipeline that 
will deliver value in the near term and over time. There can be no assurance that these strategies will deliver the desired result, whichcould affect profita
bility in the future.BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS
Abbreviated legal pathways
 for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and, since the passage of the ACA, a framework for suchapproval exists in the U.
S. If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products, our biotechnologyproducts may become subject to compet
ition from these biosimilars, with attendant competitive pressure, and price reductions could follow. The expiration orsuccessful challenge of a
pplicable patent rights could trigger this competition, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. We may face litigation withrespect to the validity and/or s
cope of patents relating to our biotechnology products.We are developing biosimilar medicines.
 The evolving pathway for registration and approval of biosimilar products by the FDA and regulatory authorities incertain other countries
 could diminish the value of our investments in biosimilars. Other risks related to our development of biosimilars include the potential forsteeper than an
ticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity, coupled with high costs associated with clinical development or intellectual propertychallenges that may pr
eclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar products. There is also a risk of lower prescriptions of biosimilars due topotential concerns over
 comparability with innovator medicines.RESEARCH STUDIES
Decisions about research 
studies made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketingstrategy and payer reimbursement pos
sibilities if it receives regulatory approval. For example, a wider range of studies can lead to approval for a broader set ofindications that may impa
ct the marketing and payer reimbursement process. However, each additional indication must be balanced against the time andresources required to demonstrate benef
it, the increased complexity of development and the potential delays to approval of the lead indication. We try to planclinical tria
ls prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges, but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between trial conduct, speed anddesired outcome wil
l be achieved each time. The degree to which such potential challenges are foreseen and addressed could affect our future results.RISKS AFFECTING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
Our international operations cou
ld be affected by currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, expropriation and other restrictive government actions,changes in intellectual p
roperty legal protections and remedies, trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, andmarketing of, reimbursement for and a
ccess to our products, as well as by political unrest, unstable governments and legal systems and inter-governmentaldisputes. Any of these changes could adve
rsely affect our business.Many emerging markets have exper
ienced growth rates in excess of developed markets, leading to an increased contribution to the industry’s globalperformance. As a result, we have been e
mploying strategies to grow in emerging markets, including the full integration of emerging markets into each of ourtwo distinct operating segment
s: IH and EH. However, there is no assurance that our strategies in emerging markets will be successful or that these countrieswill continue to sustain thes
e growth rates. In addition, some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or politicalinstability or significant currency fluc
tuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending. Even though we constantlyPfizer Inc.

ging markets for any unanticipated risk to Pfizer, certain financial or political events in such markets, as discussed above, canadversely affect our results.
SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS
Specialty pharmaceuticals are m
edicines that treat rare or life-threatening conditions that typically have smaller patient populations. The growing availability anduse of innovative specialt
y pharmaceuticals, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, has generatedpayer interest in developing 
cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector. While the impact of payers’ efforts to control access to and pricing of specialtypharmaceuticals has had l
imited impact on Pfizer to date, a number of factors may lead to a more significant adverse business impact in the future given ourgrowing specialty bus
iness portfolio. These include the increasing use of health technology assessments in markets around the world, U.S. PBMs seeking tonegotiate greater discounts, deteriorat
ing finances of certain governments, the uptake of biosimilars as they become available and efforts by government officialsor legislators to implement me
asures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products.CONSUMER HEALTHCARE
The Consumer Healthcare bus
iness may be impacted by economic volatility, the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, generic or store brandcompetition affecting consumer 
spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products or generic store brands. In addition, regulatory andlegislative outcomes regarding
 the safety, efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our Consumer Healthcare products may require withdrawal,reformulation and/or relabel
ing of certain products (e.g., cough/cold products). See The Global Economic Environme nt risk factor below. PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING RISKS
Difficulties or delays in product m
anufacturing or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions, shut-downs, approval delays, withdrawals,recalls, penalties, supply disrup
tions or shortages, reputational harm, product liability, unanticipated costs or otherwise. Examples of such difficulties or delaysinclude, but are not limited to, the 
inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand; the failure to predict market demand for, or to gainmarket acceptance of, approved products; the poss
ibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable and that the quality ofincoming materials 
may be substandard and not detected; the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal andexternal supply network a
nd/or comply with cGMPs and other applicable regulations such as serialization (which allows for track and trace of products in thesupply chain to enhance patient safety); 
risks to supply chain continuity as a result of natural or man-made disasters at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor,including those that may be related to 
climate change; or failure to maintain the integrity of our supply chains against intentional and criminal acts such aseconomic adulteration, product d
iversion, product theft, and counterfeit goods.Regulatory agencies periodically insp
ect our drug manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with applicable cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with theserequirements may subject us to po
ssible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctions orvoluntary recall of a product, an
y of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In February 2017,we received a warning letter
 from the FDA communicating FDA’s view that certain violations of cGMP regulations exist at Hospira’s manufacturing facility inMcPherson, Kansas. Hospira is 
undertaking corrective actions to address the concerns raised by the FDA. Communication with the FDA is ongoing. Until theviolations are corrected, the F
DA may refuse to grant premarket approval applications and/or the FDA may refuse to grant export certificates related to productsmanufactured at McPherson, Kansas.
OUTSOURCING AND ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING
We outsource certain services
 to third parties in areas including transaction processing, accounting, information technology, manufacturing, clinical trialexecution, clinical lab services, no
n-clinical research, safety services, integrated facilities management and other areas. For example, in 2016, we placed themajority of our clinical trial execution
 services with four strategic Clinical Research Organizations (CROs). Service performance issues with these CROs mayadversely impact the pro
gression of our clinical trial programs. Outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to sub-optimal quality of service deliveryor deliverables, which may result in
 repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, erroneous data, supply disruptions, non-compliance(including with applicable legal requirem
ents and industry standards) or reputational harm, with potential negative implications for our results.We continue to pursu
e a multi-year initiative to outsource some transaction-processing activities within certain accounting processes and are migrating to aconsistent enterprise resour
ce planning system across the organization. These are enhancements of ongoing activities to support the growth of our financialshared service capabil
ities and standardize our financial systems. If any difficulties in the migration to or in the operation of our enterprise resource planningsystem were to occur, they cou
ld adversely affect our operations, including, among other ways, through a failure to meet demand for our products, or adverselyaffect our ability to m
eet our financial reporting obligations.Pfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSCOLLABORATIONS AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES
We depend on third-party collabo
rators, service providers, and others in the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates andalso enter into joint ventures and othe
r business development transactions in connection with our business. To achieve expected longer term benefits, we maymake substantial upfro
nt payments in such transactions, which may negatively impact our reported earnings. We rely heavily on these parties for multipleaspects of our drug development and commer
cialization activities, but we do not control many aspects of those activities. Third parties may not completeactivities on schedule o
r in accordance with our expectations. Failure by one or more of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory or otherobligations to Pfizer, or an
y disruption in the relationships between Pfizer and these third parties, could delay or prevent the development, approval orcommercialization of our prod
ucts and product candidates and could also result in non-compliance or reputational harm, all with potential negative implicationsfor our product pip
eline and business.DIFFICULTIES OF OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS
In 2016, our largest biopharmaceutica
l wholesaler accounted for approximately 16% of our total revenues (and approximate ly 31% of our total U.S. revenues),and our top three biopharmaceutical 
wholesalers accounted for approximately 39 % of our total revenues (and approximately 76 % of our total U.S. revenues). Ifone of our significant biopharma
ceutical wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties, such wholesaler might decrease the amount of business thatit does with us, and we might be unab
le to collect all the amounts that the wholesaler owes us on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact ourresults of operations.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
We expect to continue to enhance our in-
line products and product pipeline through collaborations, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, equity- or debt-basedinvestments, mergers and acqui
sitions. However, these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities, competition fromother pharmaceutical companie
s that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify, structure and execute transactions, including theability to satisfy the cond
itions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated timeframe or at all, and integrate acquisitions. Further, while we seek tomitigate risks and l
iabilities of such transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts failto discover, that are not disclo
sed to us, or that we inadequately assess. Additionally, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, includingthe possibility that expec
ted synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time frame.COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS
A counterfeit medicine i
s one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source. A counterfeit Pfizer medicine, therefore, is onemanufactured by someone other than Pfizer, but 
which appears to be the same as an authentic Pfizer medicine. The prevalence of counterfeit medicines is asignificant and growing 
industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the widespread use of the Internet, which hasgreatly facilitated the ease by 
which counterfeit medicines can be advertised, purchased and delivered to individual patients; the availability of sophisticatedtechnology that makes it easier fo
r counterfeiters to make counterfeit medicines; the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of under-regulatedwholesalers and repackagers
; the lack of adequate inspection at certain international postal facilities as counterfeit medicines are increasingly delivered direct tocustomers in small pa
rcel packages; and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters. Further, laws against pharmaceutical counterfeiting varygreatly from country t
o country, and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, in some countries,pharmaceutical counterf
eiting is not a crime; in others, it may result in only minimal sanctions. In addition, those involved in the distribution of counterfeitmedicines use complex t
ransport routes in order to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products.Pfizer’s global reputat
ion makes its medicines prime targets for counterfeiting organizations. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safetybecause of the conditions under whi
ch they are manufactured—often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites—as well as the lack ofregulation of their contents. Fai
lure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines, which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain, could adverselyimpact our business, by, among other th
ings, causing the loss of patient confidence in the Pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines, potentially resultingin lost sales, product rec
alls, and an increased threat of litigation.We undertake significant effort
s to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit medicines, including, among other things, working with the FDA and otherregulatory authorities and mu
ltinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of medicines and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecutecounterfeiters; assessing ne
w and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy our products and easier for patients andhealthcare providers to dist
inguish authentic from counterfeit medicines; implementing business practices designed to protect patient health; promoting publicpolicies intended to hind
er counterfeiting; working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit medicines; and working collaborativelywith wholesalers, pharmacies, cust
oms offices, and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage, monitor distribution channels, and improvesurveillance of distributors an
d repackagers. NoPfizer Inc.

RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
: PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT
U.S. and international governmenta
l regulations that mandate price controls and limitations on patient access to our products or establish prices paid bygovernment entities or programs fo
r our products impact our business, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations orpolicies.
In the U.S., many of our products are subje
ct to increasing pricing pressures. Pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government and publicscrutiny and calls for 
reform. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints underthe Medicaid program, and some states a
re considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. Additionally, efforts by
 government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products couldadversely affect our 
business if implemented. Private third-party payers, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing, whichcould result in lowe
r prices, lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products. Pricing pressures for our products may occur as a result ofhighly competitive 
insurance markets. Healthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts orimplementing more rigorous bid
ding or purchasing review processes.We encounter similar regulatory
 and legislative issues in most other countries. In certain international markets, such as Europe, Japan, China, Canada andSouth Korea, governments take an active ro
le in setting prices, access criteria (e.g., through public or private health technology assessments), or other means ofcost control, particular
ly under recent global financing pressures. As a result, we expect that pressures on the pricing component of operating results willcontinue.
The adoption of
 restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions, failure to obtain timely or adequate government-approved pricing or formula
ry placement where required for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could also adverselyimpact revenue. In 
our vaccines business, we participate in a tender process in many countries for participation in national immunization programs. Failure tosecure participation in nat
ional immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business.U.S. HEALTHCARE REFORM/HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION
The U.S. healthcare industry 
is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. For example, the ACA was enacted by Congress in March2010 and established a major expans
ion of health care coverage, financed in part by a number of new rebates, discounts, and taxes that had a significant effecton our expenses and profitabilit
y. See the discussion under the Overview of Our Performance, Ope rating Environment, Strategy and Outlook — Our OperatingEnvironment 
— Industry-Specific Challenges — Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access — U.S. Healthcare Legislation section in our 2016 Financial Reportand in 
Item 1. Business under the caption Government Regulation and Price Constraints—In the United States . In 2017, we may face uncertainties becau sethere likely will be federal legislative an
d administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. Although therevenues generated for Pfizer by the Med
icaid expansion and health insurance exchanges under the ACA have been exceeded by the new rebates, discounts,and taxes, there is no assurance that repeal o
r replacement of the ACA will not adversely affect our business and financial results, particularly if replacementlegislation reduces incentives f
or employer-sponsored insurance coverage, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrativechanges relating to 
healthcare reform will affect our business.Other U.S. federal or state legi
slative or regulatory action and/or policy efforts could adversely affect our business, including, among others, changes in patentlaws, the importation of pres
cription drugs from outside the U.S. at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries (which is among theU.S. presidential administration’s p
olicy proposals), restrictions on U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising, limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals,or the use of comparative effectivenes
s methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes thetherapeutic differenc
es among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines.U.S. DEFICIT-REDUCTION ACTIONS
In the U.S., government actions to reduce the nat
ional deficit may affect payment by government programs for our products or services provided using ourproducts. The Congressional Budget Off
ice routinely releases options for reducing the federal deficit, and the December 2016 release includes proposals to capMedicaid grants to the states, and to requi
re manufacturers to pay a minimum rebate on drugs covered under part D of Medicare for low-income beneficiaries.Significant Medicare reductions
 could also result if Congress proceeds with certain proposals to convert the Medicare fee-for-service program into a premiumsupport program, or
 it chooses to implement the recommendations made annually by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which are primarily intendedto extend the fiscal solvency of the 
Medicare program. These and any other significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting Medicare, Medicaid orother publicly funded 
or subsidized healthPfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSprograms that may be implemented, and/or an
y significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broad deficit-reduction effort couldhave an adverse impact on our result
s of operations.SUBSTANTIAL REGULATION
We are subject to extensive, co
mplex, costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the U.S., principally by the FDA and theDEA, and foreign regula
tory authorities. Failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to operating restrictions and criminalprosecution, monetary
 penalties and other disciplinary actions, including, sanctions, warning letters, product seizures, recalls, fines, injunctions, suspension,revocation of approvals, or exc
lusion from future participation in government healthcare programs.DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS
Innovation is critica
l to the success of our company. The outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing newproducts is inherently unce
rtain and involves a high degree of risk and cost. Drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable.The process from early dis
covery or design to development to regulatory approval can take many years. Drug candidates can and do fail at any stage of theprocess, including as the
 result of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existingclinical data. There can 
be no assurance regarding our ability to meet anticipated pre-clinical and clinical trial commencement and completion dates, regulatorysubmission and approval dates, and 
launch dates for product candidates, or as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or fornew indications or dosage for
ms for existing products, which will depend on the assessment by regulatory authorities of the benefit-risk profile suggested by thetotality of the efficacy and safety 
information submitted. Decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling, ingredients and other matters could adverselyaffect the availability o
r commercial potential of our products. There is no assurance that we will be able to address the comments in complete response lettersreceived by us with respe
ct to certain of our drug applications to the satisfaction of the FDA, that any of our late stage pipeline products will receive regulatoryapproval and/or be
 commercially successful or that recently approved products will be approved in other markets and/or be commercially successful. There isalso a risk that we may not adequate
ly address existing regulatory agency findings concerning the adequacy of our regulatory compliance processes andsystems or implement su
stainable processes and procedures to maintain regulatory compliance and to address future regulatory agency findings, should theyoccur. In addition, there are ris
ks associated with interim data, including the risk that final results of studies for which interim data have been provided and/oradditional clinical trials may be differ
ent from (including less favorable than) the interim data results and may not support further clinical development of theapplicable product candid
ate or indication.There are many considerations that can affe
ct the marketing of our products around the world. Regulatory delays, the inability to successfully complete oradequately design a
nd implement clinical trials within the anticipated quality, time and cost guidelines or in compliance with applicable regulatory expectations,claims and concerns about safety and eff
icacy, new discoveries, patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that canadversely affect our business. Fu
rther, claims and concerns about safety and efficacy can result in a negative impact on product sales, product recalls orwithdrawals, and/or consu
mer fraud, product liability and other litigation and claims. Increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy, with regulatoryauthorities increasing
ly focused on product safety and the risk/benefit profile of products as they relate to already-approved products, has resulted in a morechallenging, expensive and 
lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for, among other things, additional clinical trials prior to granting approval orincreased post-approval r
equirements, such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.In addition, failure to put in pla
ce adequate controls and/or resources for effective collection, reporting and management of adverse events from clinical trials andpost-marketing surveillance, in c
ompliance with current and evolving regulatory requirements could result in risks to patient safety, regulatory actions and risks toproduct sales.
The FDA, along with other regulato
ry agencies around the world, has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug applications, which has delayed approvals ofnew generic products. These delay
s have become longer, and while the FDA has stated that it is taking steps to address the backlog of pending applications,continued approval delays may be e
xperienced by generic drug applicants over the next few years.POST-APPROVAL DATA
As a condition to granting market
ing approval of a product, the FDA may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials. The results generated in thesePhase 4 trials could resu
lt in the loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of aproduct. Regulatory agencies 
in countries outside the U.S. often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements. Post-marketing studies,whether conducted by us or by others and whethe
r mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary, and other emerging data about marketed products, such asadverse event reports, may also adve
rsely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products. Further, the discovery of significant problems with aproduct similar to one of our produ
cts that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on the availability orcommercial potential of the affe
cted products. Accordingly, new data about our products, or products similar to our products, could negatively impact demand forour products due to real or

inty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in updated labeling, restrictions on use, product withdrawal or recall.INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
Risks and uncertaintie
s apply if we provide something of value to a healthcare professional and/or government official. If the interaction is found to be improper,government enforcement actions and penalt
ies could result. These risks may increase as non-U.S. jurisdictions adopt or increase enforcement efforts of newanti-bribery laws and regulatio
ns.CHANGES IN LAWS AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Our future results could be adverse
ly affected by changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or changes in laws and regulations, including,among others, changes in accounting standard
s, taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws, changes to existing tax laws and revised taxlaw and regulatory interpretat
ions, including changes affecting the taxation by the U.S. of income earned outside the U.S. that may result from pending andpossible future propos
als), competition laws, privacy laws and environmental laws in the U.S. and other countries. For additional information, see the Provision for Taxes on Income 
— Changes in Tax Law and New Accounting Standards sections, and Notes to Consol idated Financial Statements— Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significa
nt Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards in our 2016 Financial Report. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We and certain of o
ur subsidiaries are involved in various patent, product liability, consumer, commercial, securities, antitrust, environmental, employment andtax litigations and cla
ims, government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation isinherently unpredictable, and ex
cessive verdicts do occur. Although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could in the future incurjudgments, enter into settlements of c
laims or revise our expectations regarding the outcomes of certain matters, and such developments could have a materialadverse effect on our results of operation
s in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.Claims against our patents 
include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. Although we believe we havesubstantial defenses to these chal
lenges with respect to all of our material patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss inany of these cases could result 
in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and couldmaterially affect future
 results of operations.Like other pharmaceutical co
mpanies, we are subject to investigations and extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed marketsand multiple emerging marke
ts in which we operate. As a result, we have interactions with government agencies on an ongoing basis. Criminal charges, andsubstantial fines and/
or civil penalties, as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from governmentinvestigations.
Our activities relat
ing to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the FFDCA, the Medicaid Drug RebateProgram, the FCPA and other federal and state 
statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this 2016 Form 10-K, as well as anti-kickback and false claimslaws, and similar laws in international jurisdictions
. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and othertypes of information demands from gove
rnment authorities, and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought bygovernmental authorities, as 
well as by consumers and private payers. In some instances, we have incurred significant expense, civil payments, fines and otheradverse consequences
 as a result of these claims, actions and inquiries. For example, these claims, actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures toaccurately interpret or ident
ify or prevent non-compliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information (approved andunapproved), potentially resu
lting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation. This risk may be heightened by digital marketing, including socialmedia, mobile applications an
d blogger outreach.ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND PROCEEDINGS
We and certain of o
ur subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claims andproceedings. Amounts recorded for cont
ingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily onestimates and assumptio
ns. While we have accrued for worldwide environmental liabilities, there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurredbeyond the amounts accrued. If we fail to prope
rly manage the safety of our facilities and the environmental risks associated therewith or if we are required toincrease our accruals for 
contingencies for environmental claims and proceedings in the future, it could potentially have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations.

TABLE OF CONTENTSRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
: PATENT PROTECTION
Our long-term success la
rgely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination ofintellectual property, 
including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and licenseagreements, to protect our intellectua
l property and proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not beable to prevent third parties from 
launching generic versions of our branded products, using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that arevery similar or 
identical to ours. Our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, or be granted on a timely basis. Similarly,any term extensions that we seek ma
y not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad toprotect us against 
third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular productarea. The scope of our patent claims al
so may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws. We may be subject to challenges bythird parties regarding our 
intellectual property, including, among others, claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term.Our ability to enforce our patents a
lso depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual propertyrights, and the extent to which certa
in sovereigns may seek to engage in a policy of routine compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property as aresult of local political pressure 
or in the case of national emergencies. In countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity, mechanisms exist permittingsome form of challenge to our patents by co
mpetitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity,and generic companies are inc
reasingly employing aggressive strategies, such as “at risk” launches to challenge our patent rights. Most of the suits by genericdrug manufacturers involve c
laims that patents covering our products, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drugmanufacturer. Also, countercla
ims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rightswith respect to certain product
s constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. We are also party to other patent damages suits in variousjurisdictions pur
suant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of genericentry. Further, if we are unable to ma
intain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectualproperty, including because su
ch agreements expire or are terminated, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Likewise, in the U.S. and othe
r countries, we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending, any of which may be thesubject of a governmental or third
-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As our products mature, our reliance onour trademarks and trade dress to different
iate us from our competitors increases and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting,registering or using trad
emarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adverselyaffected. We actively seek to prote
ct our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants,other advisors and other third part
ies to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment,engagement or other relationship. De
spite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining andusing our trade secrets or our other 
intellectual property without authorization, and legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for thedamages caused by such unauthorized use. Furthe
r, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumventour intellectual property b
y means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS
A properly functioning int
ellectual property regime is essential to our business model. We are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights ofother companies, but the patent granting process 
is imperfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectualproperty rights held by other compan
ies that we believe were improperly granted. Such challenges may include negotiation and litigation, which may not besuccessful.
Part of our EH business depends upon su
ccessfully identifying generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilar opportunities and launching products to takeadvantage of those opportunities, which 
may involve litigation, associated costs and time delays, and may ultimately not be successful. These opportunities mayarise in situations 
where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired, where patents have been declared invalid, or where products do notinfringe the patents of others. To achieve a “f
irst-to-market” or early market position for generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars, we may take action,such as litigation, asse
rting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable.Third parties may cla
im that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by the third party. Claims of intellectual property infringement can becostly and time-consum
ing to resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant damages. We are involved in patent-related disputeswith third parties over ou
r attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars. Once we have final regulatory approval of the related genericPfizer Inc.
2016 Form 10-K 19 
TABLE OF CONTENTSpharmaceuticals products 
or biosimilars, we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings (including anyappeals) have not been resolved (i.e., 
“at-risk” launch). If those proceedings ultimately determine that our products infringe the patent rights of third parties, wemay face patent infringement damages, in
cluding the possibility of owing the third party a reasonable royalty or the lost profits from the sale of the brandedproduct. Remedies also may 
include or consist of an injunction preventing us from further manufacture or sales of the affected product during the term of one ormore of the valid, infringed patents. 
Any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.RISK RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY 
: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY
Significant disrupt
ions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our businesses. We rely to a large extentupon sophisticated information te
chnology systems to operate our businesses. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amountsof confidential information 
(including, but not limited to, personal information and intellectual property), and we deploy and operate an array of technical andprocedural controls to mainta
in the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced significant elements of our operationsto third parties, includ
ing significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendorrelationships with th
ird parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology andinformation security s
ystems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present onthem), make such systems potentia
lly vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees orvendors, or from at
tacks by malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with awide range of motives (includin
g, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states andothers. As a global pharmaceuti
cal company, our systems are subject to frequent attacks. Due to the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that theymay remain undetected for a period of ti
me. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that ourefforts will prevent se
rvice interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operationsand/or result in the loss of cr
itical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harmto us. We maintain cyber
 liability insurance; however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that mayresult from an interruption or b
reach of our systems.RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS 
: STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS
The success of our 
acquisitions of Hospira, Anacor, Medivation and AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business will depend, in large part, on ourability to realize anticipated 
benefits from combining these businesses with Pfizer. We, for example, may fail to achieve cost savings anticipated with theacquisition of Hospira, or suc
h cost savings within the expected time frame. Similarly, the accretive impact anticipated from the acquisitions of Hospira, Anacorand Medivation may not be reali
zed or may be delayed. Integration of these businesses may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoingbusiness, including third-party
 relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. We also may fail to generate the revenue growthfor the acquired business that we expe
cted at the time of entering into the transaction. Expected revenue from acquired products and product candidates alsomay be constrained by
 developments outside of our control. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges regularly adverselyimpact revenue and income contr
ibution from products and product candidates, including those acquired in these acquisitions. Hospira, for example, hasexperienced manufact
uring disruptions, device remediations and substantial regulatory scrutiny due to quality issues, including receiving a warning letter fromthe FDA in February 2
017 communicating FDA ’  s view that certain violations of cGMP regulations exist at Hospira ’  s manufacturing facility in McPherson,Kansas. Manufacturing problems, a
s well as any corrective actions and their operational implementation, could adversely impact the revenue we generate fromproducts acquired from
 Hospira and result in substantial unanticipated costs.OTHER RISKS:
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
Like all businesses, 
we are exposed to both global and industry-specific economic conditions. Governments, corporations and insurance companies, whichprovide insurance bene
fits to patients, have implemented increases in cost-sharing and restrictions on access to medicines, potentially causing patients toswitch to generic products, de
lay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments. Government financing pressures can lead to negative pricing pressurein various markets whe
re governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g., through public or private health technology assessments), orother means of cost control. Examp
les include Europe, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and a number of other international markets. The U.S. continues tomaintain competitive insurance
 markets, but has also seen significantPfizer Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTSincreases in patient cost-
sharing and growing government influence as government programs continue to grow as a source of coverage.The global economic environ
ment has not had, nor do we anticipate that it will have, a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Due to our significantoperating cash flows, financ
ial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that wehave, and will mainta
in, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolvingeconomic conditions, but there can be no gua
rantee that changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capitalresources or impact our abi
lity to obtain financing in the future.We continue to monitor
 credit, capital restrictions and economic situations in volatile regions and markets, especially where the ability to obtain U.S. dollars forlocal currency is unp
redictable and challenging. We cannot predict the likelihood of future changes in these economic conditions, or what impact they may haveon our results of operations, financ
ial condition or business.In addition, given that a signif
icant portion of our business is conducted in the EU, including the U.K., the formal change in the relationship between the U.K. andthe EU caused by Brexit may po
se certain implications to our research, commercial and general business operations in the U.K. and the EU. Details on howBrexit will be executed and 
the impact on the remaining EU countries will dictate how and whether the broader EU will be impacted and what the resulting impacton our business may b
e, especially in EU nations with weaker economic conditions such as Greece. For additional information, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capit
al Resources — Global Economic Conditions — U.K. section in our 2016 Financial Report.We also continue to monitor the g
lobal trade environment and potential trade conflicts. If trade restrictions reduce global economic activity, or if other factors leadto a general economic downturn, potentia
l impacts could include declining sales; increased costs; volatility in foreign exchange rates; a decline in the value ofour financial assets and pens
ion plan investments; required increases of our pension funding obligations; increased government cost control efforts; delays orfailures in the performance of cu
stomers, suppliers, and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business; and the risk that ourallowance for doubtful accounts 
may not be adequate.FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK
Significant portions of our 
revenues and earnings, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. 50% of our total 2016 revenues were derived f
rom international operations, including 21% from Europe and 20% from Japan and the rest of Asia. As we operate inmultiple foreign curren
cies, including the euro, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, the U.K. pound, the Canadian dollar and approximately 100 othercurrencies, changes in those cu
rrencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. If the U.S. dollar were to weaken against anothercurrency, assuming all other
 variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses wouldincrease, having a negative i
mpact on earnings. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variablesremained constant, our revenues wou
ld decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact onearnings. Therefore, signifi
cant changes in foreign exchange rates, including those changes resulting from the volatility following the U.K. referendum in whichvoters approved Brexit,
 can impact our results and our financial guidance.The impact of possible c
urrency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact our results andfinancial guidance. For addit
ional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the Overview of Our Performance, Ope rating Environment,Strategy and Outlook––Our Financia
l Guidance for 2017 and Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources sections in our 2016 Financial Report.
In addition, our interest-bearing 
investments and borrowings, and our pension benefit obligations, net, and our postretirement benefit obligations, net, are subjectto risk from changes in inte
rest rates and foreign exchange rates. These risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in theForward-Looking Information and Facto
rs That May Affect Future Results — Financial Risk Management section in our 2016 Financia l Report. For additionaldetails, see the Notes to Conso
lidated Financial Statements— Note 7E. Financial Instrum ents: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities and — Note 11. Pension and Postretirement

tes and Assumptions––Benefit Plans section in our 2016 Financia l Report. Those sections of our 2016 Financial Reportare incorporated by reference.
Notwithstanding our efforts to fore

in product, segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, internalreorganizations, product w

ing could adversely affect future results. Such risks and uncertainties include, in particular, our ability to realize the projected benefits of(i) our cost-reduction an
d productivity initiatives; (ii) our internal separation of our commercial operations into our current operating structure; (iii) any othercorporate strategic initiatives
; and (iv) any acquisitions, divestitures or other initiatives, such as our acquisitions of Hospira, Anacor, Medivation andAstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-inf
ectives business.In addition, our co
nsolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill. For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure issignificant, and there can be no certa
inty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. The nature of the biopharmaceutical business is high-riskand requires that we invest in a 
large number of projects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products. Our ability to realize value on thesesignificant investment
s is often contingent upon, among other things, regulatory approvals and market acceptance. As such, we expect that many of theseIPR&D assets wi
ll become impaired and be written off at some time in the future. For goodwill, all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that canlead to a goodwill impa
irment charge (such as, among other things, unanticipated competition, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a significantadverse change in legal matters o
r in the business climate and/or a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity). Any such charge may besignificant. Our other intang
ible assets, including developed technology rights and brands, face similar risks for impairment and charges related to such assetsmay be significant as well. For
 additional details, see the Significant Accounting Policies and  Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptionssection in our 2016 
Financial Report.We also regularly re
view our equity-method investments for impairment. An impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events ormanagement decisions that impact ou
r estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments. We may recognize impairment charges as aresult of a weak economic env
ironment, events related to particular customers or asset types, challenging market conditions or decisions by management.INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The accuracy of our financial 
reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting canprovide only reasonable assu
rance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements.Failure to maintain eff
ective internal control over financial reporting, or lapses in disclosure controls and procedures, could undermine the ability to provideaccurate disclosure (including with r
espect to financial information) on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our disclosures(including with respect to fin
ancial information), require significant resources to remediate the lapse or deficiency, and expose us to legal or regulatoryproceedings.
TERRORIST ACTIVITY

 On October 23, 2014, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized an $11 billion share-purchase plan (the October 2014 Stock Purchase Plan), and sharepurchases commenced thereunder in January 2015. In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a new $11 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over
time. On March 8, 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co.
 (GS&Co.) to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on March 10, 2016
, we paid $5 billion to GS&Co. and received an initial delivery of approximately 136 million shares of our common stock from GS&Co. based on a price of $29.36 per share, which represented, based on
 the closing share price of our common stock on the NYSE on March 8,2016, approximately 80% of the notional amount of the accelerated share repurchase agreement. On June 20
, 2016, the accelerated share repurchase agreement withGS&Co. was completed, which, per the terms of the agreement, resulted in G
S&Co. owing us a certain number of shares of Pfizer common stock. Pursuant to theagreement’s settlement terms, we received an additional 
18 million shares of our common stock from GS&Co. on June 20, 2016. The  average price paid for all of theshares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreement was 
$32.38 per share. The common stock received is included in Treasury stock . This agreement was entered into pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization. At December 31, 2016, our remaining share-purchase authorization was
approximately 
$11.4 billion at December 31, 2016 . (b)

    OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
Our Business
We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development and manufacture of
healthcare products. Our global portfolio includes medicines and vaccines, as well as many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products. We work across
developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our 
time. We collaborate with healthcareproviders, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. Our revenues are derived from the sale of our
products and, to a much lesser extent, from alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered or developed by other companies or us (Alliance revenues).
We manage our commercial operations through 
two distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH). Each operating segment hasresponsibility for its commercial activities and for certain IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products that generally have
achieved proof-of-concept. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 18A. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information: Segment Information 
and the “Our Strategy––Commercial Operations” section of this Financial Review below. The majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and highly regulated.
As a result, we face a number of industry-specific factors and challenges, which can significantly impact our results. These factors include, among others:
 the loss or expirationof intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights, healthcare legislation, pipeline productivity, the regulatory environment, pricing and access
pressures and competition. We also face challenges as a result of the global economic environment. For additional information about these factors and challenges, see 
the“Our Operating Environment” and “The Global Economic Environment” sections of this Financial Review and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our 
2016 Form 10-K. The financial information included in our consolidated financial statements for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States (U.S.) is as of and for the year ended
November 30 for each year presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended December 31 for each year presented.
References to developed and emerging markets in this Financial Review include:
Developed markets
 U.S., Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, South Korea, Scandinaviancountries, Finland and New Zealand
 
   Emerging markets (include, but are not limited to) Asia (excluding Japan and South Korea), Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe,Central Europe, the Middle East and Turkey
References to operational variances in this Financial Review pertain to period-over-period growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange as well as the negative
currency impact related to Venezuela. The operational variances are determined by multiplying or dividing, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current
year average foreign exchange rates and then multiplying or dividing, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. Although exchange rate
changes are part of our business, they are not within our control. Exchange rate changes,
 however, can mask positive or negative trends in the business; therefore, we believepresenting operational variances provides useful information to evaluate the results of our business.
Our significant business development activities include:
•
On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion therapy net assets, HIS, to ICU Medical for up to approximately $900 million , composed of cash and contingent cash consideration, ICU Medical common stock and seller financing. Assets and liabilities associated with HIS are presented as held for sale in the consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.
•
On December 22, 2016, which falls in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 for our international operations, we acquired the development and commercialization rights toAstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, primarily outside the U.S., including the commercialization and development rights to the newly approved EU
drug Zavicefta™ (ceftazidime-avibactam), the marketed agents Merrem™/Meronem™ (meropenem) and Zinforo™ (ceftaroline fosamil), and the clinical development assets
ATM-AVI and CXL (ceftaroline fosamil-AVI).
•
On September 28, 2016, we acquired Medivation for $81.50 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Medivation was approximately $14.3 billion in cash ( 
$13.9 billion , net of cash acquired). Of this consideration, approximately $365 million was not paid as of December 31, 2016, and was recorded in Other current liabilities . Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Medivation, and, in accordance with our
domestic reporting periods, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
December 31, 2016 reflect approximately three months of legacy Medivation operations. •
On June 24, 2016, we acquired Anacor for $99.25 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Anacor was approximately $4.9 billion in cash ( $4.5 billion , net of cash acquired), plus 
$698 million debt assumed. Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Anacor, and, in accordance with our domestic reporting periods, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
December 31, 2016 reflect approximately six months of legacy Anacor operations, which were immaterial.
•
On April 6, 2016, we announced that the merger agreement between Pfizer and Allergan entered into on November 22, 2015 was terminated by mutual agreement of thecompanies. The decision was driven by the actions announced by the U.S. Department of Treasury

    on April 4, 2016, which the companies concluded qualified as an “Adverse Tax Law Change” under the merger agreement. In connection with the termination of the
 mergeragreement, on April 8, 2016 (which fell into Pfizer’s second fiscal quarter), Pfizer paid Allergan $150 million (pre-tax) for reimbursement of Allergan’s expenses associated
with the terminated transaction (see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 4 . Other (Income)/Deductions –– Net ). Pfizer and Allergan also released eachother from any and all claims in connection with the merger agreement.
•
On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira for approximately $16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Hospira. In accordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
December 31, 2015 reflect four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and three months of legacy Hospira international operations.

Our 2016 Performance
Revenues––2016
Revenues 
in 2016 were $52.8 billion , an increase of 8% compared to 2015 . This reflects an operational increase of 11% , which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 
3% .Compared to 
2015 , international revenues for 2016 were favorably impacted by approximately $100 million as a result of having one more selling day in international markets. In the U.S., there was no difference in selling days in 
2016 , compared to 2015 . The following provides an analysis of the 2016 revenue growth:

Income from continuing operations 
before provision for taxes on income was $8.4 billion in 2016 , compared to $9.0 billion in 2015 , primarily reflecting, among other items, in addition to the operational and foreign exchange impacts for 
Revenues described above: •
higher Cost of sales (up $2.7 billion ) (see the “Costs and Expenses––Cost of Sales” section of this Financial Review); •
a $1.7 billion charge related to the write-down of HIS net assets to fair value less estimated costs  to sell (see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– Note 2B.

Note 5 . Tax Matters.Our Operating Environment
Industry-Specific Challenges
Intellectual Property Rights 
and Collaboration/Licensing RightsThe loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. Many of our
branded products have multiple patents that expire at varying dates, thereby strengthening our overall patent protection.
 However, once patent protection has expired or hasbeen lost prior to the expiration date as a result of a legal challenge, we lose exclusivity on these products, and
 generic pharmaceutical manufacturers generally producesimilar products and sell them for a lower price. The date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that the paten
t or regulatory exclusivityexpires. However, when generic competition does commence, the resulting price competition can substantially decrease our revenues for the impacted products, often in a
very short period of time.
Our biotechnology products, including BeneFIX, ReFacto, Xyntha and Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the
 U.S. and Canada), may face in the future, or already face,competition from biosimilars (also referred to as follow-on biologics). If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars that reference our biotechnology
products, our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from these biosimilars, with attendant competitive pressure, and price reductions could follow.
Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. However, biosimilar
manufacturing is complex. At least initially upon approval of a biosimilar competitor, biosimilar competition with respect to biologics may not be as significant as generic
competition with respect to small molecule drugs.
We have lost exclusivity for a number of our products in certain markets and we have lost collaboration rights with respect to a number of our alliance products in certain
markets, and we expect certain products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years.

 For additional information, see the “Government Regulation and Price Constraints” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business”, of our2016 
Form 10-K. Impacts on our 
2016 Results We recorded the following amounts in 
2016 as a result of the U.S. Healthcare Legislation: •
$410 million recorded as a reduction to Revenues , related to the Medicare “coverage gap” discount provision; and •
$312 million recorded in Selling, informational and administrative expenses , related to the fee payable to the federal government (which is not deductible for U. S. incometax purposes) based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs.
Impacts on our 
2015 Results We recorded the following amounts in 
2015 as a result of the U.S. Healthcare Legislation: •
$399 million recorded as a reduction to Revenues , related to the Medicare “coverage gap” discount provision; and •
$251 million recorded in Selling, informational and administrative expenses , related to the fee payable to the federal government (which is not deductible for U. S. incometax purposes) based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs. The decrease in
the impact of the U.S. Healthcare Legislation on 
Selling, informational and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily a result of the non-recurrence of the $215 million charge in 2014 to account for an additional year of the non-tax deductible Branded 
Prescription Drug Fee, partially offset by a lower favorable true-up in2015, compared to the favorable true-up in 2014, associated with the final invoice for the respective prior-calendar year received from the federal government, which
reflected a lower share than that of the initial invoice.
Impacts on our 
2014 Results We recorded the following amounts in 2014 as a result of the U.S. Healthcare Legislation:
•
$382 million recorded as a reduction to Revenues , related to the Medicare “coverage gap” discount provision; and •
$362 million recorded in Selling, informational and administrative expenses , related to the fee payable to the federal government. 2014  included a $215 million charge toaccount for an additional year of the non-tax deductible Branded Prescription Drug Fee in accordance with final regulations issued in the third quarter of 2014 by 
the IRS.The amount in 2014 also reflected a favorable true-up associated with the final 2013 invoice received from the federal government, which reflected a lower share than that
of the initial 2013 invoice.
The final regulations issued by the IRS did not change the payment schedule for the
 Branded Prescription Drug Fee; accordingly there was no cash flow impact in 2014 fromthe $215 million charge.
Regulatory Environment/P
ricing and Access––Government and Other Payer Group PressuresGovernments, MCOs and other payer groups continue to seek increasing discounts on our products through a variety of means,
 such as leveraging their purchasing power,implementing price controls, and demanding price cuts (directly or by rebate actions). In Europe, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and some other international markets,
governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to patients and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-
sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global economic pressures. In the U.S., a primary government activity with implications for pharmaceutical pricing is
deficit reduction. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, and/or any
significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any
 broad deficit-reduction effort could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Significant Medicare reductions could also result if Congress proceeds with certain proposals to convert the Medicare fee-for-service program into a premium support program,
or it chooses to implement the recommendations made annually by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which are primarily intended to extend the fiscal solvency of
the Medicare program.
Consolidation among MCOs has increased the negotiating power of MCOs and other private insurers. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, increasingly employ
formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement
for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue.
Additionally, efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products could adversely affect our business
if implemented. There has recently been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of
pharmaceuticals. We believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of
6
 
 2016 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We continue to work with stakeholders to ensure access to
 medicines within an efficientand affordable healthcare system.
Adoption of other new legislation at the federal or state level could further affect
 demand for, or pricing of, our products. In 2017, we may face uncertainties because there likelywill be federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. Although the revenues generated for
Pfizer by the Medicaid expansion and health insurance exchanges under the ACA have been exceeded by the
 new rebates, discounts, and taxes, there is no assurance thatrepeal or replacement of the ACA will not adversely affect our business and financial results, particularly if replacement legislation reduces incentives for employer-sponsored
insurance coverage, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. We will
continue to actively work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes and lower costs to
 the healthcare system.The potential for additional pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continues to be significant. Some employers, seeking to avoid the tax on high-cost health
insurance in the ACA to be imposed in 2020, are already scaling back healthcare benefits and an increasing number are implementing high deductible benefit designs. This is
a trend that is likely to continue, especially if proposals to limit the tax exclusion for employer sponsored health insurance ultimately become law. Private third-party payers,
such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharmaceutical and medical device product pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and a reduction
in demand for our products. Pricing pressures for our products may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets. Healthcare provider purchasers, directly or
through group purchasing organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.
Overall, there is increasing pressure on U.S. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health
outcomes. Longer term, we are seeing a shift in focus away from fee-for-service payments towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharing arrangements that reward
providers for cost reductions. These new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, and restricted access to,
 new medicines. At the same time, these models canalso expand utilization by encouraging physicians to screen, diagnose and focus on outcomes.
Outside the U.S., governments, including the different EU Member States
, may use a variety of cost-containment measures for our pharmaceutical products, including pricecuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing, and international reference pricing (i.e., the practice of many countries linking their regulated medicine prices to those of other
countries). This international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and assessments of value across countries has led to different prices in different
countries and some third-party trade in our products between countries.
In particular, international reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation. Price variations,
exacerbated by international reference pricing systems, also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations. The downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be
expected to continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies and measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some European countries.
In addition, several important multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), are
increasing policy pressures and scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations (e.g., 
2016 UN High Level Panel Report on Access to Medicines 
and 2017 OECD Report on New Health Technologies –– Managing Access, Value and Sustainability ). Government adoption of these recommendations may lead to additional pricing pressures.
In response to the evolving U.S. and global healthcare spending landscape, we are continuing to work with health authorities, health 
technology assessment and qualitymeasurement bodies and major U.S. payers throughout the product-development process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products
. Further,we are seeking to develop stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines that we discover or develop, register and manufacture, by
recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and competitor medicines along with patterns of healthcare costs.
Regulatory Environment––Pipeline
 ProductivityThe discovery and development of safe, effective new products, as well as the development o
f additional uses for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength ofour businesses. We have encountered increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy, even as we continue 
to gather safety and other data on our products, beforeand after the products have been launched. Our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offse
t revenue losses when products lose their market exclusivity, aswell as to provide for earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. These activities involve a high degree of risk and cost and may take many years,
and with respect to any specific R&D project, there can be no assurance that 
the development of any particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product willachieve the desired clinical endpoints and safety profile, will be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially.
During the development of a product, we conduct clinical trials to provide data on the drug’s safety and ef
ficacy to support the evaluation of its overall benefit-risk profile for aparticular patient population. In addition, after a product has been approved and launched, we continue 
to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients, and post-marketing trials may be conducted, including trials requested by regulators and trials that we do voluntarily to gain additional medical knowledge. For the entire life of the
product, we collect safety data and report potential problems to the FDA and o
ther regulatory authorities. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions may evaluatepotential safety concerns related to a product or a class of products and 
take regulatory actions in response, such as updating a product’s labeling, restricting the use of aproduct, communicating new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, removing a product from the market.

    Competition
Many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications. For
additional information, see the “Competition” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business”, of our 
2016 Form 10-K. The Global Economic Environment
In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses, are exposed to 
the economic cycle, which impacts our biopharmaceutical operationsglobally.
•
Governments, corporations, and insurance companies, which provide insurance benefits to patients, have implemented increases in cost-sharing and restrictions on accessto medicines, potentially causing patients to switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less e
ffective treatments. Government financing pressures canlead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g., through public or private health
technology assessments), or other means of cost control. Examples include Europe, Japan, China, Canada, Sou
th Korea and a number of other international markets. TheU.S. continues to maintain competitive insurance markets, but has also seen significant increases in patient cost-sharing and growing government influence as government

We continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several European markets, including Greece, where economicconditions remain challenging and uncertain. For further information about our 
Accounts Receivable , see the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this Financial Review.

Significant portions of our revenues and earnings, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek tomanage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency
assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. Depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments
and foreign currency debt. As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, the U.K. pound
, the Canadian dollarand approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. If the U.S. dollar were to weaken
against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses
would increase, having a negative impact on earnings. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variables remained
constant, our revenues would decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings. Therefore,
significant changes in foreign exchange rates, including those changes resulting from the volatility following the U.K. referendum in which voters approved the exit from the
EU, can impact our results and our financial guidance.
The impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations, including Venezuela and more recently
Egypt, can impact our results and financial guidance. In the fourth quarter of
 2015, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $806 million and an inventory impairment chargeof $72 million related to conditions in Venezuela. For further information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and
Capital Resources” and the “Our Financial Guidance for 
2017 ” sections of this Financial Review. For further information about our foreign currency losses related to Venezuela, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––

In June 2016, the U.K. electorate voted in a referendum to leave the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The U.K. government has not formally notified theEuropean Council of their intention to leave the EU. In January 2017, the
 U.K. Parliament voted in favor of legislation to give the Prime Minister the power to trigger Article50 of the Lisbon Treaty to begin the two-year negotiation process establishing the terms of 
the exit and outlining the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU. TheU.K. Prime Minister has said the negotiations are expected to begin at the end o
f March 2017. This process is expected to be highly complex, and, in January 2017, thePrime Minister announced a 12-point plan of negotiating objectives and confirmed that the U.K. government will not seek continued membership of the EU single market.
The end result of these negotiations may pose certain implications to our research, commercial and general business operations in the U.K. and the EU.
We generated approximately 2% of our worldwide revenues from the U.K. in 2016. However, except for the foreign currency exchange impact from the weakening U.K.
pound relative to the U.S. dollar to date, there are no other immediate-term impacts to our business as there has
 not yet been a formal change in the relationship betweenthe U.K. and the EU. In addition, because
 of the significant uncertainties associated with the negotiation process, any potential long-term impacts are not currentlydeterminable.
Pfizer maintains a strong financial position while operating in a complex global environment. Due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital
markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the
foreseeable future. Our long-term debt is rated high quality by both S&P and Moody’s. 
As market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. We havetaken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. Both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid,
well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities. For further discussion of our financial condition and credit ratings, see the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and
Capital Resources” section of this Financial Review.

    Our Strategy
We believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also 
from a reductionin other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. We continue to actively engage in
dialogues about the value of our medicines and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and 
treat disease and improve outcomes. We continueto work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize patient access
and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. We remain firmly committed to fulfilling our company’s purpose of innovating to bring therapies to patients that extend and
significantly improve their lives. By doing so, we expect to create value for the patients we serve and for our shareholders.
Commercial Operations
We manage our commercial operations through two distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH), which was previously known as
Established Products. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, we reorganized our operating segments to reflect 
that we now manage our innovative pharmaceutical andconsumer healthcare operations as one business segment, IH. From the beginning of our fiscal year 2014 until the second quarter of 2016
, these operations were managed astwo business segments: the GIP segment and the 
VOC segment. We have revised prior-period information to reflect the reorganization. The IH and EH operating segmentsare each led by a single manager. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain IPR&D projects for new investigational products and
additional indications for in-line products that generally have achieved proof-of-concept. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets.
Some additional information about our business segments follows:
IH Segment
  EH Segment IH focuses on developing and commercializing novel, value-creating medicines and
vaccines that significantly improve patients’ lives, as well as products for consumer
healthcare.
Key therapeutic areas include internal medicine, vaccines, oncology, inflammation &
immunology, rare diseases and consumer healthcare.
  EH includes legacy brands that have lost or will soon lose market exclusivity in bothdeveloped and emerging markets, branded generics, generic sterile injectable
products, biosimilars and, through February 2, 2017, infusion systems. EH also
includes an R&D organization, as well as our contract manufacturing business.
Leading brands include:
- 
Prevnar 13- 
Xeljanz- 
Eliquis- 
Lyrica  (U.S., Japan and certain other markets) - 
Enbrel (outside the U.S. and Canada) - 
Viagra  (U.S. and Canada) - 
Ibrance- 
Xtandi- Several OTC consumer products (e.g., 
Advil  and  Centrum )   Leading brands include:- 
Lipitor- Premarin 
family - Norvasc
- Lyrica 
(Europe, Russia, Turkey, Israel and Central Asia countries) - 
Celebrex- Pristiq
- 
Several sterile injectable productsWe expect that the IH biopharmaceutical portfolio of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line and newly launched products will be sustained by ongoing investments to
develop promising assets and targeted business development in areas of focus to help ensure a pipeline of highly-differentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical
need. The assets managed by IH are science-driven, highly differentiated and generally require a high-level of engagement with healthcare providers and consumers.
EH is expected to generate strong consistent cash flow by providing patients around the world with access to
 effective, lower-cost, high-value treatments. EH leverages ourbiologic development, regulatory and manufacturing expertise to seek to advance its biosimilar development portfolio. Additionally, EH leverages capabilities in formulation
development and manufacturing expertise to help advance its generic sterile injectables portfolio. EH may also engage in targeted business development to further enable its
commercial strategies.
The following change in 2016 impacted IH:
•
In connection with the formation in early 2016 of the GPD organization, a new unified center for late-stage development for our innovative products, which is generallyresponsible for the clinical development of assets that are in clinical trials for our WRD and Innovative portfolios, certain development-related functions transferred from IH
to GPD.
The following changes in 2016 impacted EH:
•
Beginning in 2016, our contract manufacturing business, Pfizer CentreOne, is part of EH. Pfizer CentreOne consists of (i) the revenues and expenses of legacy Pfizer'scontract manufacturing and active pharmaceutical ingredient sales operation (previously known as Pfizer CentreSource or PCS), including the revenues and expenses
related to our manufacturing and supply agreements with Zoetis, which prior to 2016 was managed outside EH as part of PG
S and previously reported in “OtherUnallocated” costs; and (ii) the revenues and expenses of legacy Hospira's One-2-One sterile injectables contract manufacturing operation, which has been included in EH
since we acquired Hospira on September 3, 2015.
•
In connection with the formation of a new EH R&D organization effective in the first quarter of 2016, certain functions transferred from Pfizer’s WRD organization to the newEH R&D organization. The new R&D organization within EH expects to develop potential new sterile injectable drugs and therapeutic solutions, as well as biosimilars.

    In September 2016, we announced our decision to maintain our current business structure and not pursue a split into two separate
 publicly-traded companies at that time.Following this decision, we will continue to operate two distinct businesses, each with a focus on our strategic priorities to grow and increase operational efficiency. For IH, this
means a continued focus on R&D productivity and pipeline strength while maximizing the value of our recently launched brands and in-line portfolio. Our recent acquisitions of
Anacor and Medivation expanded our pipeline in the high priority therapeutic areas of inflammation and immunology and oncology. For EH, we will continue to invest in growth
drivers and manage the portfolio to extract additional value while seeking opportunities for operating efficiencies. This strategy includes active management of our portfolio;
maximizing growth of core product segments; acquisitions to strengthen core areas of our portfolio further, such as our recent acquisition of As
traZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business; and divestitures to increase focus on our core strengths. In line with this strategy
, on February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of Pfizer’s global infusiontherapy net assets, representing the infusion systems net assets tha
t we acquired as part of the Hospira transaction, HIS, to ICU Medical, a global device manufacturer. Foradditional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––

Research and Development
 OperationsWe continue to strengthen our global R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&D to achieve a sustainable pipeline
that will deliver value in the near term and over time. Our R&D priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies and vaccines with the greatest medical and
commercial promise, innovating new capabilities that can position Pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the
pace of innovation and productivity. To that end, our research primarily focuses on:
•
Biosimilars;•
Inflammation and Immunology;•
Metabolic Disease and Cardiovascular Risks;•
Neuroscience;•
Oncology;•
Rare Diseases; and•
Vaccines.While a significant portion of R&D is done internally, we also seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties
to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our product lines, by entering into collaborations, alliance and license agreements with
other companies, as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity- or debt-based investments. These agreements enable us to co-develop, license or acquire promising
compounds, technologies or capabilities. We also enter into agreements pursuant to which a third party agrees to fund a portion of
 the development costs of one of our pipelineproducts in exchange for rights to receive potential milestone payments, revenue sharing payments, profit sharing payments and/or royalties. Collaboration, alliance, license
and funding agreements and equity- or debt-based investments allow us to share risk and cost and to access external scientific and 
technological expertise, and enable us toadvance our own products as well as in-licensed or acquired products.
In early 2016, we formed the GPD organization, a new, unified center for late-stage development for our innovative products
. GPD is expected to enable more efficient andeffective development and enhance our ability to accelerate and progress assets through our pipeline. GPD combines certain previously separate development-related
functions from the IH business and the WRD organization to achieve a development capability that is expected 
to deliver high-quality, efficient, and well-executed clinicalprograms by enabling greater speed, greater cost efficiencies, and reduced complexity across our development portfolio.

Intellectual Property Rights
We continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasingly aggressive infringement whenever appropriate, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen
worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to ensure appropriate patient access. In addition, we will continue to employ innovative approaches
designed to prevent counterfeit pharmaceuticals from entering the supply chain and to achieve greater control over the distribution of our products, and
 we will continue toparticipate in the generics market for our products, whenever appropriate, once they lose exclusivity. Also, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to
challenge intellectual property rights held by other companies that we believe were improperly granted. Such challenges may include negotiation and litigation, which may not
be successful. For additional information about our current efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––

The more significant recent transactions and events are described below:
•
Sale of Hospira Infusion Systems Net Assets to ICU Medical, Inc. ––On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion therapy net assets,  HIS, to ICUMedical for up to approximately 
$900 million , composed of cash and contingent cash consideration, ICU Medical common stock and seller financing. HIS includes IV pumps, solutions and devices. Under the terms of the agreement, we received 
3.2 million newly issued shares of ICU Medical common stock, which we valued at approximately 
$430 million (based upon the closing price of ICU Medical common stock on the closing date less a discount for lack of marketability), a promissory note in the amount of 
$75 million and net cash of approximately $200 million before customary adjustments for net working capital. In addition, we are entitled to receive a contingent amount of up to an additional 
$225 million in cash based on ICU Medical’s achievement of certain cumulative performance targets for the combined company through December 31, 2019. After receipt of the ICU Medical shares, we own approximately 
16.4% of ICU Medical as of the closing date. We have agreed to certain restrictions on transfer of our ICU Medical shares for 
18 months. The promissory note from ICU Medical has a term of three years and bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% for the first year and LIBOR plus 
2.50% for the second and third years. At December 31, 2016, we determined that the carrying value of the HIS net assets held for saleexceeded their fair value less estimated costs to sell, resulting in a pre-tax impairment charge of 
$1.7 billion which is included in Other (income)/deductions––net (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
––Note 4. Other (Income)/Deductions––Net ) . The difference between the carrying value and fair value of the HIS net assetsheld for sale and the resulting pre-tax impairment may change when determined as of the February 3, 2017 closing date as a result of several factors,
 such as changes inthe carrying value of the HIS net assets between December 31, 2016 and 
the closing date.•
Acquisition of AstraZeneca’s Anti-Infectives Business (EH) ––On December 22, 2016, which falls in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 for our international operations, we acquired the development and commercialization rights to AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, primarily outside the U.S., including the commercialization
and development rights to the newly approved EU drug Zavicefta™ (ceftazidime-avibactam), the marketed agents Merrem™/Meronem™ (meropenem)
and Zinforo™ (ceftaroline fosamil), and the clinical development assets ATM-AVI and CXL (ceftaroline fosamil-AVI). Under the terms of the agreement, P
fizer made anupfront payment of approximately 
$550 million to AstraZeneca upon the close of the transaction and will make a deferred payment of $175 million in January 2019. In addition, AstraZeneca is eligible to receive up to 
$250 million in milestone payments, up to $600 million in sales-related payments, as well as tiered royalties on sales of Zavicefta™ and ATM-AVI in certain markets.
•
Acquisition of Medivation, Inc. (IH) ––On September 28, 2016, we acquired Medivation for $81.50 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Medivation was approximately 
$14.3 billion in cash ( $13.9 billion , net of cash acquired). Medivation’s portfolio includes Xtandi (enzalutamide), an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells. Xtandi is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration between Pfizer
and Astellas. Astellas has exclusive commercialization rights for Xtandi outside the U.S. In addition, Medivation has two development-stage oncology assets
 in its pipeline:talazoparib, which is currently in a Phase 3 study for the treatment of BRCA-mutated breast cancer,
 and pidilizumab, an immuno-oncology asset being developed fordiffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies. We expect this acquisition will accelerate our leadership in Oncology 
–– a high priority area for ourcompany.

Acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IH) ––On June 24, 2016, we acquired Anacor for $99.25 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Anacor was approximately 
$4.9 billion in cash ( $4.5 billion net of cash acquired) plus $698 million debt assumed. Anacor’s crisaborole, a non-steroidal topical PDE-4 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties, was approved by the FDA on December 14, 2016 under the trade name, Eucrisa, for the treatment o
f mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis inpatients two years of age and older, commonly referred to as a type of eczema. 
Anacor also holds the rights to Kerydin, a topical treatment for onychomycosis (toenailfungus) that is distributed and commercialized by Sandoz 
in the U.S. •
Research and Development Arrangement with NovaQuest Co-Investment Fund II, L.P. ––On November 1, 2016, we announced the discontinuation of the global clinical development program for bococizumab. During December 2016, 
$31.3 million was refunded to NovaQuest representing amounts NovaQuest prepaid for development costs (under the May 2016 agreement described below) that were not used for program expenses due to the discontinuation of 
the development program. No additionalpayments are expected to be received from or paid to NovaQuest under this agreement, which was effectively terminated on November 18, 2016.
In May 2016, our agreement with NovaQuest became effective, under which NovaQuest agreed to 
fund up to $250 million in development costs related to certain Phase III clinical trials of Pfizer’s bococizumab compound and Pfizer agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for such compound.
NovaQuest’s development funding was expected to cover up to 
40% of the development costs and was to be received over five quarters during 2016 and 2017. As therewas a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to NovaQuest, the development 
funding applicable to program expenses during 2016 was recognized as an obligation toperform contractual services and therefore has been recognized as a reduction of 
Research and development expenses as incurred. The reduction to Research and development expenses 
for 2016 totaled $180.3 million . •
Research and Development Arrangement with NovaQuest Co-Investment Fund V, L.P. ––In April 2016, Pfizer entered into an agreement with NovaQuest under which NovaQuest will fund up to $200 million in development costs related to certain Phase III clinical trials of Pfizer’s rivipansel compound and Pfizer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for such compound. NovaQuest’s development funding is expected to cover up
 to 100% of the developmentcosts and will be received over approximately twelve quarters from 2016 to 2019. As there is a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to
 NovaQuest, the developmentfunding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services and therefore is a reduction of 
Research and development expenses as incurred. The reduction to 
Research and development expenses for 2016 totaled $46.6 million . Following potential regulatory approval, NovaQuest will be eligible to receive a combination of fixed milestone payments of up to approximately $267 million in total, based on achievement of first commercial sale and certain levels of cumulative net sales as well as
royalties on rivipansel net sales over approximately eight years. Fixed sales-based milestone payments will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to 
Amortization of intangible assets 
over the estimated commercial life of the rivipansel product and royalties on net sales will be recorded as Cost of sales when incurred. •
Terminated Agreement to Combine with Allergan plc ––On April 6, 2016, we announced that the merger agreement between Pfizer and Allergan entered into on  November22, 2015 was terminated by mutual agreement of the companies. In connection with the 
termination of the merger agreement, on April 8, 2016 (which fell into Pfizer’ssecond fiscal quarter), Pfizer paid Allergan 
$150 million (pre-tax) for reimbursement of Allergan’s expenses associated with the terminated transaction. Pfizer and Allergan also released each other from any and all claims in connection with the merger agreement. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––

Research and Development Arrangement with RPI Finance Trust ––In January 2016, Pfizer entered into an agreement with RPI, a subsidiary of Royalty Pharma, under which RPI will fund up to 
$300 million in development costs related to certain Phase III clinical trials of Pfizer’s Ibrance (palbociclib) product primarily for adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor positive early breast cancer (the Indication). RPI’s development funding is expected to cover up to 100% o
f the costs primarily for the applicableclinical trials through 2021. As there is a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to RPI, 
the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to performcontractual services and therefore is a reduction of 
Research and development expenses as incurred. The reduction to Research and development expenses for 2016 totaled 
$44.9 million . If successful and upon approval of Ibrance in the U.S . or certain major markets in the EU for the Indication based on the applicable clinical trials, RPIwill be eligible to receive a combination of approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to $250 million dependent upon results of the clinical trials and royalties on
certain Ibrance sales over approximately seven years. Fixed milestone payments due upon approval will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to 
Amortization of intangible assets 
over the estimated commercial life of the Ibrance product and sales-based royalties will be recorded as Cost of sales when incurred. •
Acquisition of Hospira (EH) ––On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira, a leading provider of sterile injectable drugs and infusion technologies as well as a provider of biosimilars, for approximately 
$16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). For additional information, see the “Our Business” section of this Financial Review. •
Acquisition of a Minority Interest in AM-Pharma B.V. (IH) ––In April 2015, we acquired a minority equity interest in AM-Pharma, a privately-held Dutch biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of recAP for inflammatory diseases, and secured an exclusive option to acquire the
 remaining equity in the company. The optionbecomes exercisable after completion of a Phase II trial of recAP in the treatment
 of Acute Kidney Injury related to sepsis, which is expected in 2017. Under the terms ofthe agreement, we paid $87.5 million for both the exclusive option and the minority equity interest, which was recorded as a cost-method investment in 
Long-term investments 
, and we may make additional payments of up to $512.5 million upon exercise of the option and poten tial launch of any product that may result from thisinvestment.

Collaboration with OPKO Health, Inc. ––We entered into a collaborative agreement with OPKO, which closed in January 2015, to develop and commercialize OPKO’s long- acting hGH-CTP for the treatment of GHD in adults and children, as well as for the treatment
 of growth failure in children born SGA who fail to show catch-up growth by twoyears of age. hGH-CTP has the potential to reduce the required dosing frequency of human growth hormone to
 a single weekly injection from the current standard of oneinjection per day. We have received the exclusive license to commercialize hGH-CTP worldwide. OPKO will lead the clinical activities and will be responsible for funding the
development programs for the key indications, which include Adult and Pediatric GHD and Pediatric SGA. We will be responsible for all development costs for additional
indications, all postmarketing studies, manufacturing and commercialization activities for all indications, and we will lead the manufacturing activities related to product
development. In February 2015, we made an upfront payment of 
$295 million to OPKO, which was recorded in Research and development expenses, and OPKO is eligible to receive up to an additional 
$275 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. OPKO is also eligible to receive royalty payments associated with the commercialization of hGH-CTP for Adult GHD, which is subject to regulatory approval. Upon the launch of hGH-CTP for Pediatric GHD, which is subject to regulatory
approval, the royalties will transition to tiered gross profit sharing for both hGH-CTP and our product, Genotropin.
•
Acquisition of Marketed Vaccines Business of Baxter International Inc. (IH) ––On December 1, 2014 (which fell in the first fiscal quarter of 2015 for our international operations), we acquired Baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines for a final purchase price of $648 million. The portfolio that was acquired consists of NeisVac-C and
FSME-IMMUN/TicoVac. NeisVac-C is a vaccine that helps protect against meningitis caused by group C meningococcal meningitis and FSME-IMMUN/TicoVac is a
vaccine that helps protect against tick-borne encephalitis.
•
Collaboration with Merck KGaA (IH) ––In November 2014, we entered into a collaborative arrangement with Merck KGaA, to jointly develop and commercialize avelumab, the proposed international non-proprietary name for the investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody (MSB0010718C), currently in development as a potential treatment for multiple
types of cancer. We and Merck KGaA are exploring the therapeutic potential of
 this novel anti-PD-L1 antibody as a single agent as well as in various combinations with ourand Merck KGaA’s broad portfolio of approved and investigational oncology therapies. Our avelumab program with Merck KGaA has 30 programs on-going, ten of which
are potentially registration enabling trials (two in lung cancer, two in gastric cancer, two in ovarian cancer, and one each in bladder cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC),
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and RCC). We received FDA breakthrough therapy designation for avelumab in metastatic MCC. In the fourth quarter of
2016, the FDA biologics license application and the EMA marketing authorization application for MCC were accepted for review. We and Merck KGaA are also combining
resources and expertise to advance Pfizer’s anti-PD-1 antibody into Phase 1 trials. Under the terms of the agreement, in 
the fourth quarter of 2014, we made an upfrontpayment of 
$850 million to Merck KGaA and Merck KGaA is eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to approximately $2.0 billion . Both companies will jointly fund all development and commercialization costs, and split equally any profits generated from selling any anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 products from this
collaboration. Also, as part of the agreement, we gave Merck KGaA certain co-promotion rights for Xalkori in the U.S
. and several other key markets, and co-promotionactivities were initiated in key select markets in 2015. In 2014, we recorded $1.2 billion of 
Research and development expenses associated with this collaborative arrangement, composed of the $850 million upfront cash payment as well as an additional amount of $309 million, reflecting the estimated fair value of the co-promotion
rights given to Merck KGaA.

Acquisition of InnoPharma, Inc. (IH) ––On September 24, 2014, we completed our acquisition of InnoPharma, a privately-held pharmaceutical development company, for an upfront cash payment of $225 million and contingent consideration of up to $135 million.
•
License from Cellectis SA ––In June 2014, we entered into a global arrangement with Cellectis to develop Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell immunotherapies in the field of oncology directed at select cellular surface antigen targets. In August 2014, in connection with 
this licensing agreement, we made an upfront payment of $80 million toCellectis, which was recorded in 
Research and development expenses . We will also fund R&D costs associated with up to 15 Pfizer-selected targets and, for the benefit ofCellectis, a portion of the R&D costs associated with 
four Cellectis-selected targets within the arrangement. Cellectis is eligible to receive development, regulatory andcommercial milestone payments of up to $185 million per product that results from the Pfizer-selected targets as well as tiered royalties on net sales of any products that
are commercialized by Pfizer.
•
Collaboration with Eli Lilly & Company ––In 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Lilly to jointly develop and globally commercialize Pfizer ’ s tanezumab,which provides that Pfizer and Lilly will equally share product-development expenses as well as potential revenues and certain product-related costs. Following the decision
by the FDA in March 2015 to lift the partial clinical hold on the tanezumab development program, we received a $200 million upfront payment from Lilly in accordance with
the collaboration agreement between Pfizer and Lilly, which is recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet and is being recognized into 
Other (income)/deductions 
–– net over a multi-year period beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Pfizer and Lilly resumed the Phase 3 chronic pain program for tanezumab inJuly 2015. Under the collaboration agreement with Lilly, we are eligible to receive additional payments from Lilly upon the achievement of specified regulatory and
commercial milestones.
•
License of Nexium OTC Rights ––In August 2012, we entered into an agreement with AstraZeneca for the exclusive, global, OTC rights for Nexium, a prescription drugapproved to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. On May 27, 2014
, we launched Nexium 24HR in the U.S., and on July 11, 2014, we paid AstraZenecaa related $200 million product launch milestone payment. On August 1, 2014, we launched Nexium Control in Europe, and on September 15, 2014
, we paid AstraZeneca arelated $50 million product launch milestone payment. These post-approval milestone payments were recorded in 
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization 
and are being amortized over the estimated useful life of the Nexium brand. Included in Other current liabilities at December 31, 2015 are accrued milestone payments to AstraZeneca of $93 million, which were subsequently paid to AstraZeneca in April 2016. AstraZeneca is eligible to receive additional milestone payments of up
to approximately $200 million, based on the level of worldwide sales as well as quarterly royalty payments based on worldwide sales.

    Revenues
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period tha
t the revenues are recognized, and primarilyrepresent chargebacks, rebates and sales allowances to wholesalers, and, to a lesser extent, distributors like MCOs, retailers and government agencies with respect to our
pharmaceutical products. Those deductions represent estimates of rebates and discounts related to gross sales for the reporting period, and,
 as such, knowledge andjudgment of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Historically, our adjustments of estimates, to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not
 been material to our overall business. On a quarterly basis, ouradjustments of estimates to reflect actual results generally have been less than 1% of revenues,
 and have resulted in either a net increase or a net decrease in revenues.Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments,
 experiences orjudgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The sensitivity of our estimates can vary by
 program, typeof customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material
adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual and its ultimate se
ttlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Becauseof this time lag, in any given quarter, our adjustments to actual can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters.
Asset Impairment Reviews
We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least
annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the
amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets. Our impairment review processes are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements–– 
Note 1K. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Amortization of Intangible Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived Assets.Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:
•
A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. For example, a successful challenge of our patent rightswould likely result in generic competition earlier than expected.
•
A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. For example, restrictions imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities could affectour ability to manufacture or sell a product.
•
A projection or forecast that indicates losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. This could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursementprogram that results in an inability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability. This also could result from the introduction of a competitor’s product that results in
a significant loss of market share or the inability to achieve the previously projected revenue growth, as well as the lack of acceptance of
 a product by patients, physiciansand payers. For IPR&D projects, this could result from, among other things, a change in outlook based
 on clinical trial data, a delay in the projected launch date oradditional expenditures to commercialize the product.
Identifiable Intangible Assets
As a result of our identifiable intangible asset impairment review work, we recognized a number of impairments of identifiable intangible assets for the years ended
December 31, 2016 
, 2015 and 2014 . See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– Note 4. Other (Income)/Deductions — Net.When we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill, we use an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method. We s
tartwith a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the
 asset, which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply anasset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of 
the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount andtiming of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on 
the projections and the impact of technological riskassociated with IPR&D assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount
 rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cashflows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash
 flows.While all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, in general, intangible assets other than goodwill that are most at
risk of impairment include IPR&D assets (approximately 
$10.1 billion as of December 31, 2016 ) and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets. IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, as R&D is an inherently risky activity. Newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets
are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each
 reporting period. As such, immediately afteracquisition or impairment, even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment
charge.
Goodwill
As a result of our goodwill impairment review work, we concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired as of 
December 31, 2016 , and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. Examples of events or circumstances that could
impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit may include items such as changes in operating results, anticipated future cash 
flows, the discount rate and market multiples,among others. Our Consumer Healthcare reporting unit has the
2016 Financial Report    
 
 15
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    narrowest difference between estimated fair value and estimated book value. However, we believe that it would take a significant negative change in the
 undiscounted cashflows, the discount rate and/or the market multiples in the consumer industry for the Consumer Healthcare reporting unit goodwill to be impaired. Our Consumer Healthcare
reporting unit performance and consumer healthcare industry market multiples are highly correlated with the overall economy and our specific performance is also dependent
on our and our competitors’ innovation and marketing effectiveness, and on regulatory developments affecting claims, formulations and ingredients of our products.
When we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, as appropriate for the individual reporting unit, we mainly use the income approach but we may also use
the market approach, or a weighted-average combination of both approaches.
•
The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, the method that we useis the discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of
 all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit, which includes the application of aterminal value, and then we apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of
 the more significant estimates and assumptionsinherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected
 impact of technological risk and competitive, legaland/or regulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate,
 which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in theprojected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the
 projected cash flows.•
The market approach is a historical approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on external information. Within the market approach are two methods that we mayuse:
◦
Guideline public company method—this method employs market multiples derived from market prices of stocks of companies that are engaged in the same or similarlines of business and that are actively traded on a free and open market and the
 application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reportingunit’s financial performance.
◦
Guideline transaction method—this method relies on pricing multiples derived from transactions of significant interests in companies engaged in the same or similar linesof business and the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’s financial performance.
The market approach is only appropriate when the available external information is robust and deemed to be a reliable proxy for the specific reporting unit being valued;
however, these assessments may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: 
theselection of appropriate guideline companies and transactions and the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in ownership
percentages, ownership rights, business ownership forms or marketability between the reporting unit and the guideline companies and transactions.
Specifically:
•
When we estimate the fair value of our six biopharmaceutical reporting units, we rely solely on the income approach. We use the income approach exclusively as the use ofthe comparable guideline company method is not practical or reliable. For the income approach, we use the discounted cash flow method.
•
When we estimate the fair value of our Consumer Healthcare reporting unit, we use a combination of approaches and methods. We use the income approach and themarket approach, which we weight equally in our analysis. We weight them equally as we have equal confidence in the appropriateness of the approaches for this reporting
unit. For the income approach, we use the discounted cash flow method and for the
 market approach, we use both the guideline public company method and the guidelinetransaction method, which we weight equally to arrive at our market approach value.
For all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors tha
t may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome ofsubsequent goodwill impairment testing. For a list of these factors, see the “Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affec
t Future Results” section of this FinancialReview and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 
2016 Form 10-K. Benefit Plans
The majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have
 both IRC-qualified andsupplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for
retirees and their eligible dependents.
The accounting for benefit plans is highly dependent on actuarial estimates, assumptions and calculations, which can result from a complex series of judgments about fu
tureevents and uncertainties. The assumptions and actuarial estimates required to estimate the net employee benefit obligations for the
 defined benefit and postretirement plansinclude the discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality (life expectancy); expected return on plan
assets; and healthcare cost trend rates.
Effective January 1, 2016, we changed the approach used to
 measure service and interest costs for certain international pension and other postretirement benefits. For fiscal2015 and 2014, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the respective plan
obligations. For fiscal 2016, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the spot rates along the
 yield curve for certain international plans to the plans' liabilitycash flows. We believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the
corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. 
This change does not affect the measurement of our plan obligations. We have accoun ted for this change as a change inaccounting estimate and, accordingly, have accounted for it on a prospective basis. The reduction in expense 
for 2016 associated with this change in estimate was $42 million , primarily related to certain international pension plans, which was recognized evenly over each quarter of the year. The change in approach for the postretirement benefit plans
was not material to the 2016 consolidated statement of income.

    In the fourth quarter of 2014, we approved a change, e
ffective January 1, 2016, to the U.S. postretirement medical plan to transfer certain plan participants to a retiree drugcoverage program eligible for a Medicare Part D plan subsidy (EGWP). This change resulted in a decrease to the postretirement benefit obligation of approximately $600
million as of December 31, 2014.
As of 
December 31, 2016 , the noncurrent portion of our pension benefit obligations, net, and our postretirement benefit  obligations, net increased, in the aggregate, byapproximately 
$53 million compared to December 31, 2015 . The increase reflects, among other things, a decrease in our discount rate assumptions used in the measurement of the plan obligations, largely offset by an increase in actual returns on plan assets and a decrease in 
the postretirement plan obligations due to medical plan cap changeswith the U.S. and Puerto Rico postretirement plans and the adoption of 
the EGWP by the Puerto Rico postretirement plan.Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. The judgments made
in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations.

Expected Annual Rate of Return on Plan Assets
The assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect
 our actual historical return experience and our long-term assessment of forward-lookingreturn expectations by asset classes, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the implementation of our 
targeted asset allocation in ourrespective plans.
The expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. plans and
 the majority of our international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each year-end andthe resulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year. In January 2017, P
fizer made a voluntary contribution of $1.0 billion to plan assets. In2017, this contribution will be included in the plan asset balance for purposes of determining the expected return on plan assets.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs to a 50 basis point decline in our assumption for the
 expected annual rate of return on plan assets,holding all other assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):

$1.7 billion during 2016 . Discount Rate Used to Measure Plan Obligations
The weighted-average discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated
 and modified, asrequired, to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or be
tter, that reflect the rates at which the pension benefitscould be effectively settled. The discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least
 annually by reference to investment gradecorporate bonds, rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there are sufficient da
ta, a yield-curve approach. These discount rate determinations are made in consideration of localrequirements.
The measurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect 
the amount of service cost, interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefitcosts in the following year.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations to a 10 basis point

. Acquisition of Hospira
Description of Transaction
On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira, a leading provider of sterile injectable drugs and infusion technologies as well as a provider of biosimilars, for approximately
$16.1 billion 
in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). Recording of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
Our acquisition of Hospira has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which generally requires that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be
recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. A single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments abou
t future events and uncertainties and reliesheavily on estimates and assumptions. Our judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of
 assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well asasset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. For instance, the determination of asset lives can impact our results of operations as dif
ferent types of assets willhave different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.
For the amounts recognized for the Hospira assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, including measurement period adjustments recognized in 2016
to the amounts initially recorded in 2015, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 2A. Acquisitions, Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Agreements, Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment 
: Acquisitions . Below is a summary of the methodologies and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of certain classes of assets and liabilities of Hospira as of the
acquisition date.
For financial instruments acquired from Hospira, our valuation approach was consistent with our valuation methodologies used for our legacy Pfizer financial instruments. For
additional information on the valuation of our financial instruments, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 7. Financial Instruments . Inventories 
—The fair value of acquired inventory ( $1.9 billion ) was determined as follows: •
Finished goods— Estimated selling price, less an estimate of costs to be incurred to sell the inventory, and an es timate of a reasonable profit allowance for that sellingeffort.
•
Work in process— Estimated selling price of an equivalent finished good, less an estimate of costs to be incurred to complete the work-in-process inventory, an estimate ofcosts to be incurred to sell the inventory and an estimate of a reasonable profit allowance for those manufac
turing and selling efforts.•
Raw materials and supplies— Estimated cost to replace the raw materials and supplies. The fair value of inventory is recognized in our results of operations as the inventory is sold. Some of the more significant estimates and
 assumptions inherent in the estimateof the fair value of inventory include stage of completion, costs to complete,
 costs to dispose and selling price. All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact ourresults of operations.
Property, Plant and Equipment 
—The fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment is determined using a variety of valuation approaches, depending on the nature of the asset and the quality of available information. The fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment was primarily determined as follows:
•
Land–– Market, a sales comparison approach that measures value of an asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of  comparable property.•
Buildings, Machinery and equipment and Furniture and fixtures —Replacement cost, an approach that measures the value of an asset by es timating the cost to acquire orconstruct comparable assets. For buildings that are not highly specialized or that could be income producing if leased to a third party, we also considered market and
income factors.
•
Construction in progress— Replacement cost, generally assumed to equal historical book value. 18

 and equipment include the nature, age, condition or location ofthe land, buildings, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, and construction in progress, as applicable, as well as the estimate of market and replacement cost
 andthe determination of the appropriate valuation premise, in-use or in-exchange. The in-use valuation premise assesses the value of an asset when used in combination with
other assets (for example, on an installed basis), while the in-exchange valuation assesses the value of an asset on a s
tand alone basis. All of these judgments and estimatescan materially impact our results of operations.
Identifiable Intangible Assets 
— The fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets generally is determined using an income approach. This method starts with a forecastof all of the expected future net cash flows associated with 
the asset and then adjusts the forecast to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects therisk factors associated with the cash flow streams.

® (trastuzumab). In connection with the return of these rights, we wrote off these IPR&D assets, totaling $170 million . See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives for additional information. •
As of the acquisition date, the higher value remaining biosimilar IPR&D assets acquired from Hospira had been submitted to the FDA for approval and include potentialbiosimilars for (i) epoetin alfa (treatment of anemia in dialysis and oncology applications); and (ii) infliximab (rheumatoid arthritis and gastrointestinal disorde
rs), which webegan selling in the U.S. in November 2016. These biosimilars and filgrastim (oncology) are already available in certain markets outside the U.S. Filgrastim in the U.S.
market and other biosimilar IPR&D assets acquired from Hospira are in late-stage development. See the “Product Developments––Biopharmaceutical” section of this
Financial Review for additional information about these programs.
Sterile Injectable IPR&D Acquired Assets:
•
The sterile injectable IPR&D assets acquired from Hospira are in various therapeutic areas including anti-infectives, oncology, cardiovascular and neurology, among others.The sterile injectable IPR&D assets are in various stages of development with anticipated launch dates as of the
 acquisition date across 2016, 2017 and 2018.Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the estimate of the 
fair value of identifiable intangible assets include all assumptions associated withforecasting product profitability from the perspective of a market participant.

    Specifically:
•
Revenue—We use historical, forecast, industry or other sources of market data including estimates of sales volume, selling prices, market penetration, market share andyear-over-year growth rates over the product’s life cycle.
•
Cost of sales, Sales and marketing expenses, General and administrative expenses—We use historical, forecast, industry or other sources of market data to estimate thecosts associated with the identifiable intangible asset over the product’s life cycle.
•
R&D expenses—In the case of approved products, we estimate the appropriate level of ongoing R&D support, and for unapproved compounds, we estimate the amountand timing of costs to develop the R&D into viable products.
•
Estimated life of the asset—We assess the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory oreconomic barriers to entry, expected changes in standards of practice for indications addressed by the asset, as well as obsolescence fac
tors and estimated contractrenewal rates.
•
I nherent risk—We use a discount rate that is primarily based on the weighted-average cost of capital with an additional premium to reflect the risks associated with thespecific intangible asset, such as country risks (political, inflation, currency and property risks) and commercial risks. In addition, for unapproved assets, an additional risk
factor is added for the risk of technical and regulatory success, called the probability of technical and regulatory success (PTRS).
•
The discount rates used in the intangible asset valuations ranged from 11% to 16%, and the estimated cash flows were projected over periods extending up to 20 years ormore. For IPR&D assets, the PTRS rates ranged from 44% to 88%
. Within this broad range, we recorded approximately $20 million of assets with a PTRS of 44%, $230 million 
of assets with a PTRS of 45% to 75% and $780 million of assets with a PTRS above 75% ( $610 million after the write-off of the acquired biosimilar IPR&D assets discussed above). All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations.
For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the
 fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product.Contingencies

Calculation not meaningful.Revenues—Overview
Compared to 
2015 , international revenues for 2016 were favorably impacted by approximately $100 million as a result of having one more selling day in international markets. In the U.S., there was no difference in selling days in 
2016 , compared to 2015 . Total revenues in 
2016 compared to 2015 reflect an operational increase of $5.5 billion, or 11% , partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.5  billion, or3%, in 
2016 , compared to 2015 . The operational increase was primarily the result of: •
the inclusion of revenues from a full year of legacy Hospira global operations in 2016, as compared to four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and three months oflegacy Hospira international operations in 2015, resulting in operational growth of 
$3.1 billion in 2016 ; •
the continued operational growth from key brands including Ibrance, Lyrica (IH), Xeljanz and Chantix/Champix and Consumer Healthcare, (all primarily in the U.S.), as wellas Eliquis and Xalkori (globally) (collectively, up approximately $3.6 billion in 
2016 ); •
operational growth in the legacy Pfizer Sterile Injectable Pharmaceuticals portfolio, mostly in emerging markets and the U.S. (up approximately $290 million); and•
to a lesser extent, the inclusion of legacy Medivation operations of $140 million,partially offset by:
•
the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for Zyvox primarily in the U.S. and certain developed Europe markets (down approximately $410 million), Lyrica(EH) in certain developed Europe markets (down approximately $330 million) and for certain other products (collectively, down approximately $440 million) as well as
biosimilar competition for Enbrel in most developed Europe markets (down approximately $230 million);
•
the decline in Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues, primarily driven by an expected decline in revenues for the adult indication in the U.S. due to a high initial capture rate ofthe eligible population following its successful fourth-quarter 2014 launch, which resulted in a smaller remaining “catch up” opportunity compared to the prior-year, as well
as the unfavorable impact of the timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication (down approximately $450 million); and
•
the year-end 2015 expiry of the collaboration agreement to co-promote Rebif in the U.S. (down approximately $370 million in 2016 ). 2016 Financial Report

    Total revenues in 
2015 compared to 2014 reflect an operational increase of $3.0 billion, or 6%, more than offset by the unfavorable impact of  foreign exchange of $3.8 billion,or 8%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The operational increase was primarily the result of:
•
the performance of several key products in developed markets, including the continued strong uptake of Prevnar 13 among adults (largely in the U.S.), Ibrance (nearly all inthe U.S.), Eliquis, Lyrica (IH) (primarily in the U.S. and Japan), Xeljanz (primarily in the U.S.), Viagra (IH) (primarily in the U.S.) and Nexium 24HR (primarily in the U.S.)
(collectively, up approximately $4.1 billion);
•
the inclusion of four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and three months of legacy Hospira international operations of $1.5 billion;•
a 7% operational increase in revenues in emerging markets, reflecting continued strong operational growth, primarily from Prevenar 13, Lipitor and Enbrel (upapproximately $810 million); and
•
inclusion of the vaccines acquired from Baxter of $178 million,partially offset by:
•
the loss of exclusivity and immediate multi-source generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. in December 2014 and certain other developed markets (downapproximately $1.8 billion), and the loss of exclusivity for Lyrica (EH) in certain developed Europe markets (down approximately $420 million), for Zyvox in the U.S. (down
approximately $420 million), for Rapamune in the U.S. (down approximately $120 million) and for certain other products (collectively, down approximately $330 million);
•
the performance of certain other products in developed markets and BeneFIX in the U.S. (collectively, down approximately $370 million); and•
the termination of the Spiriva co-promotion collaboration in certain countries (down approximately $100 million).See the “Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights” section of this Financial Report for information about (i) recent losses of product exclusivity impacting
product revenues, (ii) recent losses of collaboration rights impacting alliance revenues and (iii) expected losses of product exclusivity in 
2017 . In addition, we expect to lose exclusivity for various other products in various markets over the next few years. For additional information, see 
the “Patents and OtherIntellectual Property Rights” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business”, of our 
2016 Form 10-K. We have significant operations outside the U.S., with revenues exceeding $500 million in the following number of countries:
The U.S. and Japan are our two largest national markets:
Revenues by National Market
 
  
Our policy relating to the supply of pharmaceutical inventory at domestic wholesalers, and in major international markets, is to generally maintain stocking levels under one
month on average and to keep monthly levels consistent from year to year based on patterns o
f utilization. We historically have been able to closely monitor these customerstocking levels by purchasing information from our customers directly or by obtaining other third-party information. We believe our data sources to be directionally reliable but
cannot verify their accuracy. Further, as we do not control this third-party data, we cannot be
 assured of continuing access. Unusual buying patterns and utilization are promptlyinvestigated.
Revenue Deductions
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period tha
t the revenues are recognized, and primarilyrepresent chargebacks, rebates and sales allowances to wholesalers, and, to a lesser extent, distributors like MCOs, retailers and government agencies with respect to our
pharmaceutical products. Those deductions represent estimates
22
 
 2016 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    of rebates and discounts related to gross sales for the reporting period and, as such, knowledge and judgment o
f market conditions and practice are required when estimatingthe impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Historically, our adjustments of estimates, to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not
 been material to our overall business. On a quarterly basis, ouradjustments of estimates to reflect actual results generally have been less than 1% of revenues,
 and have resulted in either a net increase or a net decrease in revenues.Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments,
 experiences orjudgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The sensitivity of our estimates can vary by
 program, typeof customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material
adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual and its ultimate se
ttlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Becauseof this time lag, in any given quarter, our adjustments to actual can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters.
The following table provides information about revenue deductions:
  
  Year Ended December 31, (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)
  2016  2015  2014 Medicare rebates 
(a)  $1,063  $1,002  $1,077 Medicaid and related state program rebates

(e)  $16,895  $15,014  $13,656 (a) 
 Rebates are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year are impacted by the mix of products sold.(b)
 
Performance-based contract rebates include contract rebates with managed care customers within the U.S., including health maintenance organizations and PBMs, who receive rebates based on the achievementof contracted performance terms 
and claims under these contracts. Outside the U.S., performance-based contract rebates include rebates to wholesalers/distributors based on achievement of contractedperformance for specific products 
or sales milestones.(c) 
 Chargebacks primarily represent reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.(d) 
 Sales allowances primarily represent price reductions that are contractual or legislatively mandated outside the U.S., discounts and distribution fees.(e)
 
For 2016 , associated with the following se gments: IH ( $7.1 billion ); and EH ( $9.8 billion ). For 2015 , associated with the following se gments: IH ( $5.8 billion ); and EH ( $9.2 billion ). For 2014 , associated with the following segments: IH ( 
$4.6 billion ); and EH ( $9.1 billion ). Total revenue deductions for 
2016 increased 13% compared to 2015 . The increase in revenue deductions is consistent with increased sales, and was specifically as a result of:
•
an increase in chargebacks from EH products, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of legacy Hospira sterile injectables in 2016, compared to the inclusion of only fourmonths of legacy Hospira sterile injectables in 
2015 , and from certain IH products; •
an increase in performance-based contract rebates, primarily due to sales to managed care customers in the U.S. and higher rebates in certain developed Europe marketsdue to competitive pressures post loss of exclusivity for certain products; and
•
an increase in Medicaid and related state program rebates, primarily as a result of updated estimates of sales related to these programs.For additional rebate accrual information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––

Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (IH) is our pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal disease. Overall, worldwide revenues for Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13decreased 
7% operationally in 2016 , compared to 2015 . Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues of 1% in 2016 , compared to 2015 . In the U.S., revenues for Prevnar 13 
decrease d 9% in 2016 , compared to 2015 , primarily driven by the decline in revenues for the adult indication in the U.S. due to a high initial capture rate of the eligible population following its successful fourth-quarter 2014 launch, which resulted in a smaller remaining “catch up” opportunity (i.e. the
opportunity to reach adults age 65 and older who have not been previously vaccinated with Prevnar 13) compared to the prior year. Given the
 success since the launch ofthe adult indication, approximately 50% of the eligible patient pool 65 years and above in the U.S. has
 already been vaccinated. While the remaining eligible population islarge, this cohort is much more difficult to capture. The decrease was partially offset by the timing of government purchases 
for the pediatric indication.

    Internationally, revenues for Prevenar 13 
decrease d 3% operationally in 2016 , compared to 2015 , primarily due to timing of government orders, partially offset by a modest increase in the uptake for the adult indication. Foreign exchange had an 
unfavorable impact on international revenues of 3% in 2016 , compared to 2015 . In 2014, the ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 13 for routine use
 to help protect adults aged 65 years and older against pneumococcal disease, which for adults includespneumonia caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. These ACIP recommendations were subsequently approved by the directors at the
 CDCand U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in September 2014 by the CDC. As with other
vaccines, the CDC regularly monitors the impact of vaccination and reviews the recommendations; in this case, however, the CDC announced formally that it will conduct
this review in 2018. Currently, we are working with a number of U.S. investigators to monitor the proportion of community-acquired pneumonia caused by the serotypes
included in Prevnar 13 and continue to observe trends.
In July 2016, the FDA approved an expanded age indication to include adults 18 through 49
 years of age, in addition to the already approved indications for adults 50 yearsand older, for active immunization for the prevention of pneumonia and invasive disease caused by 13 
Streptococcus pneumoniae ( S. pneumoniae ) serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C,
 19A, 19F, and 23F), and for children 6 weeks through 17 years of age (prior to the 18th birthday) for the prevention of invasive disease caused bythe 13 S 
treptococcus pneumoniae  strains in the vaccine. Prevenar 13 is now approved in the U.S., the EU and more than 40 other countries for use in adults 18 to 49years of age. Prevnar 13 is the only pneumococcal vaccine approved across the entire lifespan.
In April 2016, the EMA approved a new 4-dose, MDV presentation for Prevenar 13. 
In addition, in July 2016, we received the World Health Organization pre-qualificationapproval for the Prevenar 13 MDV presentation. This MDV presentation is being introduced under the Advance Market Commitment program in early 2017, for shipment to
countries covered by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. This new presentation will help to significantly reduce storage requirements and shipping costs in Gavi eligible countries.

to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation;◦
for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE, and for the reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy; and◦
for the prophylaxis of DVT, which may lead to PE, in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery.Eliquis utilization and adoption continues to expand across key markets. It is now the number one prescribed NOAC among cardiologists in the U.S.,
 Japan and severalEuropean countries.
◦
Xtandi (IH) is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration between Pfizer and Astellas. The two companies share equally in the gross profits (losses) related to U.S. net sales of Xtandi. Subject
 to certain exceptions, Pfizer and Astellas also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the U.S. market.Pfizer and Astellas also share certain development and other collaboration expenses and Pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of international Xtandi net sales
(recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net ). Xtandi is approved for the following indications: ◦
treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in the U.S., Europe and many other countries worldwide; and◦
treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer in Japan.Post-acquisition on September 28, 2016, Pfizer recorded 
$140 million of Xtandi alliance revenues in 2016 , all of which was attributed to the U.S. See the “Our Operating Environment—Industry-Specific Challenges—Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights” section of this Financial Review for

In May 2012, the FDA’s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee voted that the tafamidis meglumine data provide substantial evidence of efficacy for a surrogate endpoint that isreasonably likely to predict a clinic
al benefit. In June 2012, the FDA issued a “complete response” letter with respect to the tafamidis NDA. The FDA has requested the completion of a second efficacy study, andalso has asked for addition
al information on the data within the current tafamidis NDA. Pfizer initiated study B3461028 in December 2013, a global Phase 3 study to support a potential new indication intransthyretin cardiomypathy, which i
ncludes transthyretin familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (TTR-FAC) and wild-type cardiomyopathy (WT-CM). We anticipate results from this study in 2018, and continue to workwith the FDA to identify next steps.

Description of Research and Development Operations
Innovation is critical to the success of our company, and drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable.
Our R&D spending is conducted through a number of matrix organizations, and in 2016, we announced changes to our R&D operations tha
t we believe will create a strongerand more efficient R&D engine across our IH and EH businesses.
•
Research Units within our WRD organization continue to be generally responsible for research assets for our IH business (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-concept). Our Research Units are organized in a variety of ways (by therapeutic area or combinations of therapeutic areas, by discipline, by location, etc.) to enhance
flexibility, cohesiveness and focus. Because of our structure, we can rapidly redeploy resources within a Research Unit between various projects as necessary because the
workforce shares similar skills, expertise and/or focus.
•
We created an R&D organization within the EH business, which supports the large base of EH products and is expected to develop potential new sterile injectable drugsand therapeutic solutions, as well as biosimilars.
•
We formed the GPD organization, which is generally responsible for the clinical development of assets that are in clinical trials for our WRD and Innovative portfolios. GPDalso provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&D projects.
•
Our science-based and other end-to-end platform-services organizations, where a significant portion of our R&D spending occurs, provide technical expertise and otherservices to the various R&D projects, and are organized into science-based functions (which are part of our WRD organization), such as Pharmaceutical Sciences,
Medicinal Chemistry, Regulatory and Drug Safety, and non-science-based functions, such as Facilities, Business Technology and Finance. As a result, within each of these
functions, we are able to migrate resources among projects, candidates and/or targets in any therapeutic area and in most phases o
f development, allowing us to reactquickly in response to evolving needs.
We manage R&D operations on a total-company basis through our matrix organizations described above. Specifically, a single committee with representation from the R&D
groups and the IH commercial organization is accountable for aligning resources among all of our WRD, GPD and IH R&D projects and for seeking to ensure optimal capital
allocation across the Innovative R&D portfolio. We believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility. Our EH R&D organization manages its
resources separately from the WRD and GPD organizations.
Generally, we do not disaggregate total R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we do
 not manage a significant portion of ourR&D operations by development phase or by therapeutic area. Further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, as
 conditions change, we believethat any prior-period information about R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.

Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs are (i) restructuring charges of $1.2 billion in 2016 for employee termination costs, exit costs and asset impairments, which are largely associated with cost-reduction and productivity initiatives not associated with acquisitions, as well as our acquisitions of Hospira and
Medivation; (ii) transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other similar services, of 
$127 million in 2016 , most of which are directly related to our acquisitions of Medivation and Anacor, as well as costs associated with our terminated transaction with Allergan; and (iii) integration costs, representing external, incremental costs directly
related to integrating acquired businesses, and primarily include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes of 
$441 million for 2016, primarily related to our acquisition of Hospira and the terminated transaction with Allergan. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives 
. In connection with our acquisition of Hospira, we are focusing our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. We
 expect to achieve $1 billionof annual cost savings by 2018 in connection with the Hospira acquisition, 25% more than our initial cost savings target of $800
 million, and have achieved approximately $500million of cost savings through December 31, 2016. The one-time costs to generate the savings are expected to
 be approximately $1 billion (not including costs of $215 millionfor full-year 2015 associated with the return of acquired IPR&D rights), incurred for up to a three-year period post-acquisition.
In 2016, we substantially completed previously disclosed cost-reduction initiatives begun in 2014 associated with our global commercial structure reorganization, manufacturing
plant network rationalization and optimization initiatives, and additional cost-reduction/productivity initiatives across the enterprise.
Through December 31, 2016, we incurred $3.1 billion (pre-tax) in total costs for the 2014-2016 program. The cumulative ongoing annual cost savings associated with the
above-mentioned program (but not including expected cost savings associated with the Hospira acquisition), are approximately $3.1 billion. These savings were recognized, for
the most part, through the end of 2016. However, savings from costs
 incurred in the last half of 2016 are expected to largely occur in 2017. For additional information aboutthese programs and expected and actual total costs, see Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives 
. New Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives 
— 2017 through 2019 ActivitiesAs a result of the evaluation performed in connection with our decision in September 2016 to not pursue, a
t that time, splitting IH and EH into two separate publicly-tradedcompanies, we have identified new opportunities to potentially achieve greater optimization and efficiency to become more competitive in our business. Therefore, we have
initiated new enterprise-wide cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, which we expect to complete by the end of 2019. These initiatives will encompass all areas of our cost base
and will include further centralization of our corporate and platform functions and optimization of our manufacturing plant network to support IH and EH products and pipelines,
as well as activities in other areas where opportunities are identified. The action plans related to these new initiatives are underway and, in order to achieve targeted savings of
approximately $1.2 billion by 2020, we expect to incur total costs of approximately $900 million over the next three years.
The expected cost savings in 2017 associated with these activities are reflected in our 2017 financial guidance.
In addition to these major initiatives, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity
and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products.

Financial Statements— 
Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations . 2016 v. 2015
The 
lower effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of: •
the benefits related to the final resolution of an agreement in principle reached in February 2016 and finalized in April 2016 to resolve certain claims related to Protonix,which resulted in the receipt of information that raised our initial assessment in 2015 of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax position;
•
the non-recurrence of the non-deductibility of a foreign currency loss related to Venezuela;•
the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business;•
the increase in benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration ofcertain statutes of limitations; and
•
the benefits related to the adoption of a new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2016, as of January 1, 2016, requiring excess tax benefits or deficiencies of share-based compensation to be recognized as a component of the 
Provision for taxes on income . The net tax benefit was $89 million in 2016 (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards ), partially offset by:
•
the non-recurrence of tax benefits associated with certain tax initiatives.2015 v. 2014
The 
lower effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of: •
the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business;•
the non-recurrence of the non-deductibility of the $215 million charge to account for an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee in accordance with the finalregulations issued in the third quarter of 2014 by the IRS; and
•
the tax benefits associated with certain tax initiatives,partially offset by:
•
the non-deductibility of a foreign currency loss related to Venezuela; and•
the non-deductibility of a charge for the agreement in principle reached in February 2016 to resolve claims relating to Protonix.Changes in Tax Laws
On January 23, 2017, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law Act
 No. 3-2017, amending Section 2101 of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 1994, which imposesan excise tax that was effective beginning in 2011 (Act 154). The excise 
tax is imposed on the purchase of products by multinational corporations and their affiliates from theirPuerto Rico affiliates. As originally adopted, the excise tax was to be in effec
t from 2011 through 2016 and the tax rate was to decline over time from 4% in 2011 to 1% in 2016.Act No. 2-2013 extended the excise tax through 2017 and,
 effective July 1, 2013, increased the tax rate to 4% for all years through 2017. Act No. 3-2017 further extended theexcise tax for all years through 2027 at a rate of 4%. The excise 
tax has been recorded in Cost of sales and Provision for taxes on income, as appropriate. All expected impacts in 2017 have been reflected in our financial guidance for 2017.
On December 18, 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the
 2015 Act) was signed into law and generally provides for the temporary or permanentextension, retroactive to January 1, 2015, of certain tax benefits
 and credits that had expired, including the U.S. R&D tax credit, which was extended permanently. Given theenactment date of the 2015 Act, 
the benefit related to our 2015 R&D spending was recorded in 2015.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE (ADJUSTED INCOME)
General Description of Non-GA
AP Financial Measure (Adjusted Income)Adjusted income is an alternative view of performance used by management. We measure the performance of the overall Company on this basis in conjunction with other
performance metrics. Because Adjusted income is an important internal measurement for Pfizer, we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by
disclosing this performance measure. We report Adjusted income, certain
38
 
 2016 Financial Report
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    components of Adjusted income, and Adjusted diluted earnings per share in order to portray the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture,
marketing and sale of prescription medicines, vaccines and consumer healthcare (OTC) products––prior to considering certain income statement elements. We have defined
Adjusted income as 
Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are described below. Similarly, we have defined the Adjusted income components as 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses, Amortization of intangible assets 
and Other (income)/deductions––net each before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. We have defined Adjusted diluted earnings per share as 
Earnings per common share attributable to Pfizer Inc.––diluted 
before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. The Adjusted income measure and the Adjusted income component measures and the Adjusted diluted earnings per share measure are not, and should not be viewed as,
 a substitute for U.S.GAAP net income, U.S. GAA
P net income components or U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share.The following are examples of how the Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share measures are utilized:
•
senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an Adjusted income basis and Adjusted diluted earnings per share basis;•
our annual budgets are prepared on an Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share basis; and•
senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share measures. Adjusted income is theperformance metric utilized in the determination of bonuses under the Pfizer Inc. Executive Annual Incentive Plan 
that is designed to limit the bonuses payable to theExecutive Leadership Team (ELT) for purposes of IRC Section 162(m). Subject to the Section 162(m) limitation, the bonuses are 
funded from a pool based on theperformance measured by three financial metrics, including adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from Adjusted income. This metric accounts for 40% of the
bonus pool funding. The pool applies to the bonus plans for virtually all bonus-eligible, non-sales-force employees worldwide, including the ELT members and other
members of senior management. In addition, commencing with the 2015 Performance Share Awards, adjusted operating income is one of the measures utilized to
determine payout. Adjusted operating income is derived from Adjusted income.
Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures that have no s
tandardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAPand, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, Adjusted income and its components
 (unlike U.S. GAAP net incomeand its components) and Adjusted diluted earnings per share (unlike U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share) may not be comparable to the calculation of
 similar measures ofother companies. Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how
management assesses performance.
We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, the Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted
 diluted earnings per share measures have limitations,and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these metrics. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without
including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not
 provide a comparable view of our performance toother companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. We also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D
organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on
 an absolute basis and relative to a group ofpharmaceutical industry peers (pre-2015) or a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of Pfizer’s long-term incentive
compensation plans.
See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted
 information for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 below. Purchase Accounting Adjustments
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These
impacts, primarily associated with Wyeth (acquired in 2009), Hospira (acquired in 2015), Anacor (acquired in June 2016) and Medivation (acquired in September 2016), can
include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to
 fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of theacquired finite-lived intangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets
 (primarilymanufacturing facilities), amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. Therefore, 
theAdjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those
 products.Certain of the purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, but this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance tha
t is used bymanagement to internally assess business performance. We believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and
investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R&D costs previously have been
expensed.
However, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through Adjusted income. This
component of Adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items listed in the first paragraph of this sec
tion. We have not factored in the impacts of any otherdifferences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does no
t intend to berepresentative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. For example, our R&D costs in total, and
 in the periods presented, may have been different; ourspeed to commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been
 different. In addition, our marketing efforts mayhave been received differently by our customers. As such, in total, there can be
 no assurance that our Adjusted income amounts would have been the same as presented hadwe discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.

    Acquisition-Related Costs
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because
these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that
 were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. Foradditional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset
acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. We have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.
We believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in connection
with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities.
For this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the con
text of abusiness combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts.
The integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three
years of the transaction. Because of the need 
for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activitiescan be lengthy. For example, due to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical business, the
 closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturingchanges are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the FDA
 and/or other global regulatory authorities.Discontinued Operations
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such
operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our businesses and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do
not build or run our businesses with the intent to sell them. Restatements due to discontinued operations do
 not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measurefor the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented 
for consistency across all periods.Certain Significant Items
Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. Certain significant items represent substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated on an
individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspects of their nature.
 Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult topredict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs
stand on their own as they are specific to an event or goal with a defined 
term, but we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, costproductivity or in response to loss of exclusivity or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances
specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the
 date of acquisition.Unusual items may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a
 result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of ournormal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. While not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be
included as certain significant items would be a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs; amounts related to certain disposals of
businesses, products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations under U.S. GA
AP; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution ofcertain tax positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges related to certain legal matters, such as
 certain of those discussed inNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 17A. Commitments and Contingencies: Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 1, “Legal Proceedings” in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Normal, ongoing defense costs of the Company or settlements of and accruals for legal matters made in the
 normal course of our business would notbe considered certain significant items.

The effective tax rate on Non-GAAP Adjusted income was 23.0% in 2016 , 24.0% in 2015 and 26.5% in 2014. The de cline in the effective tax rate for 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix 
of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business, an increase in tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prioryears primarily with various foreign tax 
authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations, as well as benefits related to the adoption of a new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2016, as ofJanuary 1, 2016, requiring e
xcess tax benefits or deficiencies of share-based compensation to be recognized as a component of the Provision for taxes on income . The decline in the effective tax rat e in 2015compared to 2014 was primarily 
due to a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business.42

 In 2015, represents (i) an $806 million foreign currency loss  included in Other (income)/deduction s––net related to conditions in  Venezuela during 2015, that had us resolve that our Venezuelan bolivar-denominated net monetary asse
ts that are s ubject to revaluation were no longer expected to be settled at the Venezuelan government CENCOEX official rate of 6.30, but rather at the then SIMADI rate of 200,the lowest official rate. Those conditi
ons included the inability to obtain significant conversions of Venezuelan bolivars related to intercompany U.S. dollar denominated accounts, a n evaluation of the effects of theimplementation of a fourth-q
uarter 2015 operational restructuring, resulting in 36% reduction in our labor fo rce in Venezuela, and our expectation of the changes in Venezuela’s responses to changes in itseconomy; and (ii) a 
$72 million charge included in Cost of sales related to inventory i mpairment in Venezuela related to the foreign currency change described above.(k)
 
In 2015, included in Cost of sales ( $72 million ) and Selling, informational and a dministrative expenses ( $419 million ) and primarily represents a non-recurri ng charge related to settlement of pension obligationsin accordance with

are virtually all included in Revenues ( $272 million ) and Cost of sales ( $237 million ). (o)
 
Included in Provision for taxes on income. Income taxes includes the tax eff ect of the associated pre-tax amounts, calculated by determining the jurisdictional location of the pre-tax amounts and applying thatjurisdiction’s applicable tax rate. Th
e amount in 2016 was favorably impacted by ben efits related to the final resolution of an agreement in principle reached in February 2016 and finalized in April 2016 to resolvecertain claims related to Protonix, whic
h resulted in the receipt of information that raised our initial assessment in 2015 of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax position. The amount in 2015was favorably impacted by tax be
nefits associated with certain tax initiatives. In addition, the amount in 2015 was unfavorably impacted by a non-deductible foreign currency loss related to Venezuela and the non-deductible charge for the 
agreement in principle reached in February 2016 to resolve claims relating to Protonix. The amount in 2014 was favorably impacted by the decline in the non-tax deductible estimated lossrecorded in the third quart
er of 2013 related to an option to acquire the remaining interest in Teuto, since we expected to retain the investment indefinitely, and unfavorably impacted by a non-tax deductible chargeto account for an addition
al year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee in accordance with final regulations issued in the third quarter of 2014 by the IRS. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Contin

Medical—the costs associated with our Pfizer Medical organization (Medical), which, is responsible for the provision of medical information to healthcare providers, patients and other parties, transparency anddisclosure activities, clinical trial results pu
blication, grants for healthcare quality improvement and medical education, and partnerships with global public health and medical associations. In 2014 and 2015,Medical was also responsible for r
egulatory inspection readiness reviews, internal audits of Pfizer-sponsored clinical trials and internal regulatory compliance processes, which are now part of the compliancefunction within Corporate.

Corporate—the costs associated with Corporate, representing platform functions (such as worldwide technology, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs,compliance, and worldwide pr
ocurement) and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments.(v)
 
Other Unallocated—other unallocated costs, representing overhead expenses associated with our manufacturing and commercial operations that are not directly assessed to an operating segment as businessunit (segment) management 
does not manage these costs (which include manufacturing variances associated with production). The increase in Cost of sales in 2016 reflects, among o ther items, the change inmanufacturing variances drive
n by demand decreases versus plan for certain legacy Hospira and legacy Pfizer products.For information purposes only, for 
2016 , we estimate that Other costs, in the a ggregate and as described above, but excluding (i) net interest-related expense not attributable to an operating segment included inCorporate (approximately 
$828 million in Other (income)/deductions––net ); and (ii) net income from investments and other assets not attributable to an operating segment included in Corporate (approximately$177 million

    The following provides an analysis of 2016 revenue growth for IH:
 
  Year Ended December 31, (BILLIONS OF DOLLARS)
  2016  
   Acquisitions
   Inclusion of Xtandi revenues in the U.S. resulting from the
 acquisition of Medivation in September 2016  $0.1  
   Operational growth/(decline)
   Continued operational growth from key brands including Ibrance, Lyrica,
 Xeljanz, Chantix/Champix and Consumer Healthcare, all primarilyin the U.S., as well as Eliquis and Xalkori globally
  3.6 Decline in Rebif revenues in the U.S. due to the year-end 2015 expiry o
f the collaboration agreement to co-promote Rebif in the U.S., as wellas lower revenues for Enbrel in most developed Europe markets
, primarily due to biosimilar competition  (0.6 )Decline in Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues, primarily driven by an expected decline in revenues
 for the adult indication in the U.S. due to ahigh initial capture rate of the eligible population following its successful fourth-quarter 2014
 launch, which resulted in a smaller remaining“catch up” opportunity compared to 
the prior-year, as well as the unfavorable impact of the timing of government purchases for the pediatricindication
  (0.5 )Other operational factors, net

   Unfavorable impact of foreign exchange
  (0.6 )IH 
 Revenues  growth in 2016   $2.4 Total IH revenues from emerging markets were 
$3.7 billion in 2016 , compared to $4.0 billion in 2015 , reflecting 7% operational growth in 2016 , which was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 
15% . •
Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues increased slightly in 2016, compared to 2015 , due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and an increase in royalty expense, partially offset by a favorable change in product mix, including an increase in alliance revenues, which have no associated cost of sales. The increase in 
Cost of sales 
of 11% in 2016 , compared to 2015 , was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, an increase in royalty expense and an increase in sales volumes.
•
The increase in Selling, informational and administrative expenses of 6% in 2016 , compared to 2015 , reflects an increase in the allowance for doubtful trade accounts receivable, resulting from unfavorable developments with a distributor, and additional investment across several of our key products, partially offset by the favorable impact
of foreign exchange.
•
The increase in Research and development expenses of 8% in 2016 , compared to 2015 , primarily reflects: ◦
costs to close out studies for the global clinical development program for bococizumab that was discontinued in the fourth quarter of 2016,◦
increased costs associated with our oncology programs, primarily our avelumab alliance with Merck KGaA, and◦
the inclusion of three months of legacy Medivation operations in 2016,partially offset by:

Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues decreased 2.4 percentage points in 2015 , compared to 2014 , primarily driven by favorable product mix, favorable foreign exchange and a decrease in royalty expense. The decrease in 
Cost of sales of 5% in 2015 , compared to 2014 , was primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in royalty expense, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes, driven primarily by continued strong uptake of Prevnar 13 among adults, as
 wellas the acquisition of Baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines in Europe.
•
The increase in Selling, informational and administrative expenses of 10% in 2015 , compared to 2014 , reflects higher promotional expenses in the U.S., primarily for newly launched Consumer Healthcare product line extensions, Prevnar 13 in adults and Ibrance and additional investment in Eliquis, Lyrica and certain other products, partially
offset by favorable foreign exchange.
•
The increase in Research and development expenses of 19% in 2015 , compared to 2014 , primarily reflects the $295 million upfront payment to OPKO made in the first quarter of 2015, increased investment in certain late-stage pipeline programs, primarily bococizumab, and increased costs associated with our vaccine and oncology
programs, primarily our anti-PD-L1 alliance with Merck KGaA and Ibrance, partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses for certain previously approved products as well as

 inclusion of legacy Hospira operations, anincrease in certain general and administrative expenses and higher cost for the U.S. Branded Prescription Drug Fee compared to the prior year.
•
Research and development expenses increased 10% in 2015, compared to 2014, reflecting the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and increased investment in biosimilar development programs and sterile injectable development programs acquired as part of our acquisition of InnoPharma, partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses related
to postmarketing commitments, primarily Celebrex and Pristiq.
•
The unfavorable change in Other (income)/deductions––net of 45% in 2015, compared to 2014 , primarily reflects the non-recurrence of prior year gains on the sale ofproduct rights, unfavorable foreign exchange and a decrease in our equity income from our equity-method investment in China (Hisun Pfizer), partially offset by other income

    (a)
 
Amounts reflect the adoption of a new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2016, as of January 1, 2016, that requires that cash flows present (i) excess tax benefits as Other tax accounts, net as part of operating activities, rather tha
n financing activities on a prospective basis beginning in the year of adoption, and (ii) cash paid by us when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes as a cash outflowfrom financing activities, rather tha
n operating activities and is reflected in the year of adoption and retrospectively in 2015 and 2014. The year-to-date excess tax benefit was $26 million, $51 million, $87 million,and $91 million in each of t
he first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively. For cash paid by us for withholding purposes, $137 million for 2016 is presented as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and cash 
outflows of $189 million for 2015 and $195 million for 2014 were reclassified from operating activities to financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows,respectively. (see Notes to Consolid
ated Financial Statements — Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards ) .In the consolidated statements of cash flows, the line item, 
Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures , is presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as these changes do not reflect actual cash inflows or out
flows, and excluding any other significant non-cash movements.Accordingly, the amounts shown will not necessarily agree with the changes in the assets and liabilities that are presented in our consolidated balance sheets.
Operating Activities
2016 v. 2015
Our net cash provided by operating activities was 
$15.9 billion in 2016 , compared to $14.7 billion in 2015 . The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflects the increase in our net income after adjustments for the non-cash changes, as well as the timing of receipts from customers and payments 
to vendors in the ordinary course ofbusiness, partially offset by an increase in bonus payments made to employees.
In 2016, the change in the line item called 
Other adjustments, net, primarily reflects, among other items, the increase in the provision for bad debt expense and a decrease in net realized gains on sale of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by the non-cash changes in the equity losses related to Hisun and Teuto. In
 addition, the adoption of anew accounting standard in 2016 required that cash paid by us when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes is shown as a cash outflow from financing
activities rather than operating activities. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards.
In 
2016 and 2015 , the line item Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily reflects changes, in the normal course of business, in trade accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets, other noncurrent assets, trade accounts payable,
 accrued compensation and other current and non-currentliabilities. For 2016 and 2015, this line item also includes the adjustments necessary to reflect the payments of certain legal claims accrued in prior periods, including for 2016,
Protonix-related matters, and for 2015, Neurontin-related matters, partially offset by the deferral of an upfront payment
 received from Lilly as part of a collaborativearrangement. For additional information about accounts receivable, see also the “Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: Accounts Receivable” section of this
Financial Review. For additional information about our legal accruals, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—

Our net cash provided by operating activities was 
$14.7 billion in 2015 , compared to $17.1 billion in 2014 . The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflects the decrease in our net income after adjustments for the non-cash changes, as well as a $1.0
 billion voluntary pension contribution in January 2015, and the timing of otherreceipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, including higher payments related to certain liabilities associated with legal matters, partially offset by the upfront
cash payment of $850 million in 2014 in connection with our collaborative arrangement with Merck KGaA.
In 2015, the change in the line item called 
Other adjustments, net, primarily reflects the non-cash changes in the equity losses related to the Hisun and ViiV equity-method investments.

2015 and 2014 , the line item Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily reflects changes, in the normal course of business, in accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets, other noncurrent assets, accounts payable, accrued compensation and o
ther current and non-current liabilities. For2015, this line item also includes the adjustments necessary to reflect the payments of certain liabilities associated with legal matters accrued in prior periods, including

Our net cash used in investing activities was 
$7.8 billion in 2016 , compared to net cash used in investing activities of $3.0 billion in 2015 . The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to:
•
net redemptions/proceeds from sale of investments of $12.5 billion in 2016 , compared to net redemptions/proceeds of investments of $14.6 billion in 2015 ; and •
cash paid of $18.4 billion , net of cash acquired, primarily for the acquisitions of Medivation, Bamboo and Anacor in 2016 compared to cash paid of $16.5 billion , net of cash acquired, primarily for the acquisition of Hospira and the acquisition of Baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines in

•
cash paid of $16.5 billion , net of cash acquired, primarily for the acquisition of Hospira and the acquisition of Baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines in 2015 . (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—

Our net cash used in financing activities was 
$8.9 billion in 2016 , compared to net cash used in financing activities of $10.4 billion in 2015 . The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to:

Our net cash used in financing activities was 
$10.4 billion in 2015 , compared to $10.2 billion in 2014 . The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to:

We rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments, short-term commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. We
continue our efforts to improve cash inflows through working capital efficiencies. We target specific areas of focus including accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable,
and other working capital, which allows us to optimize our operating cash flows. Due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital
markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable
future, which include:
•
the working capital requirements of our operations, including our R&D activities;•
investments in our business;•
dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;•
share repurchases;•
the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;•
paying down outstanding debt;•
contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and•
business-development activities.For additional information about our share-purchase plans, see the “Share-Purchase Plans and Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreements” section of this Financial Review.

    Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&P and Moody’s. See the “Credit Ratings” section below. As market conditions change,
 we continue to monitor our liquidityposition. We have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. Bo
th short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified available-for-sale debt securities.
Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resou
rcesThe following table provides certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources:
 
  As of December 31, (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT RATIOS AND PER COMMON SHARE DATA)

 See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– Note 7. Financial Instruments for a description of certain assets held and for a description of credit risk related to our financial instruments held.(b)
 
We adopted a new accounting standard as of January 1, 2016 that changed the presentation of debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying value of thatassociated debt, consistent with t
he presentation of a debt discount. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– Note 1B. Basis of Presentation an d Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of NewAccounting Standards.
(c)
 
The change in selected net financial assets/(liabilities) is predominantly a result of cash paid for acquisitions of businesses, particularly Medivation and Anacor. We retain a strong financial liquidity position as aresult of our net cash provide
d by operating activities, our high quality financial asset portfolio and access to capital markets. Both Moody’s and S&P rating agencies maintained our strong investment-gradecorporate debt-rating subs
equent to the acquisitions. For additional information, see the “Credit Ratings” section of this Financial Review.(d)
 
The decrease in working capital is primarily due to a decrease in short-term investments and an increase in short-term borrowings, and the timing of accruals, cash receipts and payments in the ordinary course ofbusiness, partially offset by the recl
assification of Assets held for sale (see Notes to Consolidated Fina ncial Statements–– Note 2B. Acquisitions, Assets and Liabilities Hel d for Sale, Licensing Agreements,Research and Development 
and Collaborative Arrangements, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment : Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale ). (e) 
 Represents total Pfizer Inc. shareholders’ equity divided by the actual number of common shares outstanding (which excludes treasury stock).For additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the “Analysis of 
the Consolidated Balance Sheets ” and “ Analysis of the Consolidated Statements ofCash Flows 
” sections of this Financial Review.On November 21, 2016, we completed a public offering of 
$6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 3.10% 
(see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– Note 7D. Financial Instruments: Long-Term Debt ). On June 3, 2016, we completed a public offering of 
$5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 2.09% (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 7D. Financial Instruments: Long-Term Debt ). On May 15, 2014, we completed a public offering of $4.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average effec
tive interest rate of 2.26%.Domestic and Internatio
nal Short-Term FundsMany of our operations are conducted outside the U.S., and significant portions of
 our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. We generallyhold up to $10 billion of these short-term funds in U.S. tax jurisdictions. The amount of 
funds held in U.S. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts andpayments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business-development activities. As part o
f our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularlymonitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). Repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional U.S. federal, sta
te and local incometax payments. We record U.S. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be
 indefinitely reinvested outside theU.S., no accrual for U.S. taxes is provided.

    Accounts Receivable
We continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several European markets where economic conditions remain challenging
and uncertain. Historically, payments from a number of these European governments and government agencies extend beyond the contractual terms of
 sale. Specifically, wereceived delayed payments for 2015 revenues and delayed payments for 2016 revenues from the Greek government; the vast
 majority of Greece government receivablespertain to 2016 revenues. Also, the Greek government has restructured its debt 
to other third parties in the third quarter of 2016. We adjusted our allowance for doubtfulaccounts to reflect these events, and have $43 million in net receivables from the Greek government as o
f December 31, 2016 . Reported revenues from all customers in Greece for the year ended 
December 31, 2016 were $278 million. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. Our assessment is based on an analysis of the
 following: (i) payments received to date; (ii) the consistencyof payments from customers; (iii) direct and observed interactions with the governments (including court petitions) and with market participants (for example, the factoring
industry); and (iv) various third-party assessments of repayment risk (for example, rating agency publications and the movement of rates for credit default swap instruments).
As of 
December 31, 2016 , we had about $574 million aggregate gross accounts receivable from governments and/or government agencies in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. Such receivables in excess of one year from the invoice date, totaling $70 million, were as follows: $44
million in Italy; $18 million in Portugal; $4 million in Greece; and $4 million in Spain.
Although certain European governments and government agencies sometimes delay payments beyond the contractual terms of sale, we seek to
 appropriately balancerepayment risk with the desire to maintain good relationships with our customers and to ensure a humanitarian approach to local patient needs.
We will continue to closely monitor repayment risk and, when necessary, we will continue to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts.
Our assessments about the recoverability of accounts receivables can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
 uncertainties and can rely heavily onestimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 1C. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Estimates and Assumptions 
. Credit Ratings
Two major corporate debt-rating organizations, Moody’s and S&P, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any o
ther rating.The following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured long-term debt:
NAME OF RATING AGENCY
 PfizerCommercial Paper
  PfizerLong-Term Debt
  Date of Last Rating Change
  Rating  Rating  Moody’s 
(a)  P-1  A1  October 2009 S&P 
(b)  A-1+  AA  October 2009 (a) 
 In September 2016, Moody's updated its credit outlook from negative outlook to stable.(b) 
 In April 2016, S&P updated its credit outlook from negative watch to stable.Debt Capacity
We have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and
short-term investments in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. As of 
December 31, 2016 , we had access to $7.9 billion of lines of credit, of which $790 million 
expire within one year. Of these lines of credit, $7.8 billion were unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us $7.1 billion at our request. Also, $7.0 billion 
of our unused lines of credit, all of which expire in 2021, may be used to support our commercial paper borrowings. Global Economic Conditions––Ge
neralThe global economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate that it will have, a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Due to our significant operating cash
flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and
 will maintain, the abilityto meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolving economic conditions.

    Global Economic Conditions––U.K.
In June 2016, the U.K. electorate voted in a
 referendum to leave the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The U.K. government has not formally notified theEuropean Council of their intention to leave the EU. In January 2017, the
 U.K. Parliament voted in favor of legislation to give the Prime Minister the power to trigger Article 50 ofthe Lisbon Treaty to begin the two-year negotiation process establishing the terms of the exit and
 outlining the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU. The U.K. PrimeMinister has said the negotiations are expected to begin at the end of March 2017.
 This process is expected to be highly complex, and, in January 2017, the Prime Ministerannounced a 12-point plan of negotiating objectives and confirmed that the U.K. government will not seek con
tinued membership of the EU single market. The end result ofthese negotiations may pose certain implications to our research, commercial and general business operations in the U.K. and the EU.
We generated approximately 2% of our worldwide revenues from the U.K. in 2016. However, except for the foreign currency exchange impact from the weakening U.K.
 poundrelative to the U.S. dollar to date, there are no other immediate-term impacts to our business as there has no
t yet been a formal change in the relationship between the U.K.and the EU. In addition, because of the significant uncertainties associated
 with the negotiation process, any potential long-term impacts are not currently determinable.Global Economic Conditions––Ven
ezuela OperationsOur Venezuela operations continue to operate with the U.S. dollar as the func
tional currency due to the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy.In the second quarter of 2015, the Venezuelan government identified three o
fficial rates of exchange. These are the CENCOEX rate of 6.3; the SICAD rate of 13.5 (as ofFebruary 2017); and the SIMADI rate of 700 (as of February 2017). E
ffective in March 2016, the CENCOEX rate was replaced by the DIPRO rate of 10 (as of February 2017);the SICAD rate ceased to be offered; and 
the SIMADI rate was planned to be replaced by the DICOM rate, but the DICOM rate is not published. The Venezuelan governmentcontinues to publish the SIMADI rate, which is commonly referred to as the DICOM rate, and 
that rate has grown from 206 in March 2016 to about 700 (as of February 2017).Based on conditions in Venezuela, we resolved that our Venezuelan bolivar-denominated net monetary assets that are subject to
 revaluation are no longer expected to besubstantially settled at the Venezuelan government CENCOEX official rate of 6.3
 or the DIPRO official rate of 10, but at a rate of 500 at the end of the second quarter and thirdquarter of 2016, and 670 at the end of 
the fourth quarter of 2016.In 2015, conditions in Venezuela had us resolve that our Venezuelan bolivar-denominated net monetary assets that are subject
 to revaluation were no longer expected to besettled at the Venezuelan government CENCOEX official rate of 6.3
, but at the then SIMADI rate of 200, the lowest official rate. Those conditions included the inability to obtainsignificant conversions of Venezuelan bolivars related to intercompany U.S. dollar-denominated accounts, an evaluation of the effects of
 the implementation of a fourth-quarter2015 operational restructuring, resulting in a restructuring charge of $39 million related to a 36% reduction in our labor force in Venezuela, and our expectation of the changes
in Venezuela’s responses to changes in its economy. The effect of tha
t change in expectation was a foreign currency loss of $806 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015included in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 4. Other (Income)/Deductions—Net. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we had an inventory impairment loss of $72 million included in 
Cost of sales . We cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the Venezuelan currency or whether our use of the DICOM rate will continue to be
 supported by evolving factsand circumstances. Further, other potential actions by the Venezuelan government in response to economic uncertainties could impact the recoverability of our investment in
Venezuela, which could result in an impairment charge and, under extreme circumstances, could impact our ability to continue to operate in the country in the same manner as
we have historically. We continue to operate under adverse conditions in Venezuela.
On July 11, 2016, the Venezuelan government administration announced a new program under a State of
 Emergency decree that is intended to control the use of rawmaterials, production and distribution of products, specifically for medicines and foods. It is uncertain how this program will be applied to Pfizer in Venezuela. We continue to
operate in Venezuela and have $12 million of net monetary assets and $61 million of non-monetary assets, excluding inventory carried at lower of cost or market, in Venezuela
at November 30, 2016, our international year-end.
Contractual Obligations
Payments due under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, mature as follows:

Long-term debt consists of senior unsecured notes (including fixed and floating rate, foreign currency denominated, and other notes) and capital lease obligations (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 7. Financial Instruments ). Commitments under capital leases are not significant.(b)
 
Our calculations of expected interest payments incorporate only current period assumptions for interest rates, foreign currency translation rates and hedging strategies (see Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements— 
Note 7. Financial Instruments ), and assume that interest is accru ed through the maturity date or expiration of the related instrument.(c)
 
Includes expected payments relating to our unfunded U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) pension plans, postretirement plans and deferred compensation plans. Excludes amounts relating to our U.S. qualifiedpension plans and international
 pension plans, all of which have a substantial amount of plan assets, because the required funding obligations are not expected to be material and/or because such liabilities do notnecessarily reflect future cash paym
ents, as the impact of changes in economic conditions on the fair value of the pension plan assets and/or liabilities can be significant. In January 2017, we made a $1.0 billionvoluntary contribution to the U.S. 
qualified plans. We do not anticipate making any additional contributions to the U.S. qualified plans in 2017. Also, excludes $5.5 billion of 2016 Financial Report

Includes only income tax amounts currently payable. We are unable to predict the timing of tax settlements related to our noncurrent obligations for uncertain tax positions as tax audits can involve complex issuesand the resolution of thos
e issues may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.The above table includes amounts for potential milestone payments under collaboration, licensing or other arrangements, if the payments are deemed reasonably likely to
occur. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercialization
milestones, which may span several years and which may never occur.
In 
2017 , we expect to spend approximately $1.9 billion on property, plant and equipment. We rely largely on operating cash flows to fund our capital investment  needs. Due toour significant operating cash flows, we believe we have the ability to meet our capital investment needs and anticipate no delays to planned capital expenditures.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses,
 we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise inconnection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. These indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-
related matters, and patent-infringement claims. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of
 the indemnification, we would be required toreimburse the loss. These indemnifications generally are subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not
paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of 
December 31, 2016 , recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications were not significant. Certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-
promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.
Share-Purchase Plans and Ac
celerated Share Repurchase AgreementsOn October 23, 2014, we announced that the
 Board of Directors had authorized an $11 billion share-purchase plan, and share purchases commenced thereunder in January2015.
On February 9, 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co. to repurchase shares of
 our common stock. This agreement was entered intounder our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on February 11, 2015,
 we paid $5 billion to GS&Co. and received approximately 
151 million shares of our common stock from GS&Co. This agreement was completed in July 2015, and pursuant to the agreement’s settlement terms, weelected to settle the agreement in cash and paid an additional 
$160 million to GS&Co. on July 13, 2015, resulting in a total o f approximately $5.2 billion paid to GS&Co. The final average price paid for the shares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreement was $34.13 per share. For additional information, see Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements–– 
Note 12. Equity . In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a new $11 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time.
On March 8, 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co. to repurchase 
$5 billion of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on March 10, 2016, we paid 
$5 billion to GS&Co. and received an initial delivery of approximately 136 million shares of our common stock from GS&Co. based on a price of 
$29.36 per share, which represented, based on the closing share price of our common stock on the NYSE on March 8,  2016, approximately 80% of the notional amount of the accelerated share repurchase agreement. On June 20, 2016, the
 accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co. was completed, which, per the terms ofthe agreement, resulted in GS&Co. owing us a certain number of shares of Pfizer common stock.
 Pursuant to the agreement’s settlement terms, we received an additional 18 million 
shares of our common stock from GS&Co. on June 20, 2016. The  average price paid for all of the shares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreementwas 
$32.38 per share. The common stock received is included in Treasury stock . This agreement was entered into pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––

Dividends on Common Stock
We paid dividends on our common stock of 
$7.3 billion in 2016 , $6.9 billion in 2015 and $6.6 billion in 2014 . In December 2016 , our Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2017 dividend of $0.32 per share, payable on March 1, 
2017 , to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 3, 2017 . The first-quarter 2017 cash dividend will be our 313 
th consecutive quarterly dividend.Our current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our businesses and to seek to increase
shareholder value. Our dividends are not restricted by debt covenants. While the dividend level remains a decision of Pfizer’s Board of Directors and will continue to be
evaluated in the context of future business performance, we currently believe that we can support 
future annual dividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Not 
Adopted as of December 31, 2016 See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards.The following table provides a brief description of recently issued accounting standards, not yet adopted: 
 Standard/Description
 Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or OtherSignificant Matters
In October 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance on 
the assessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE 
. Under this new guidance, when evaluating whether an entity is the primary beneficiary, a
single decision maker must consider its indirect interest held through related
parties under common control proportionately.
  January 1, 2017. Earlier applicationis permitted, including adoption in
an interim period.
 
The provisions of this new standard will not have amaterial impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued an update related 
to inventory . The new guidance requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net
realizable value.
  January 1, 2017. 
We do not expect the provisions of this new standardwill have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance related to 
revenue from contracts with customers 
. The new guidance introduces a new principles- based framework for revenue recognition and disclosure. Since its issuance
the FASB has issued six ASUs, amending the guidance and ef
fective date,and the SEC has rescinded certain related SEC guidance; the most recent of
these changes was issued in December 2016.
 
January 1, 2018. Earlier applicationis permitted only as of annual
reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, including
interim reporting periods within that
reporting period.
 
We have made substantial progress in completing ourreview of the impact of this guidance across our
various business arrangements and revenue related
activities, and do not expect the adoption of this
standard to have a material impact on our financial
statements and revenue recognition practices, or our
internal controls. Under the development portion of our
collaboration agreements, we expect the milestone
payments, which are recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions 
–– net, to be amortized over thedevelopment period rather than the life of the
agreement, as we currently do. We continue to monitor
additional changes, modifications, clarifications or
interpretations undertaken by the FASB, which may
impact our current conclusions. In addition, we
continue to monitor other changes, such as changes in
our business, new collaboration arrangements,
business combinations, etc., which may impact our
current conclusions prior to the adoption date.
In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on
 the classification of certain transactions in the Statement of Cash Flows.
  January 1, 2018. Earlier applicationis permitted.
  We are assessing the impact of this guidance on ourconsolidated financial statements.
In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on 
the presentation ofrestricted cash in the Statement of Cash Flows.
  January 1, 2018. Earlier applicationis permitted.
  We are assessing the impact of this guidance on ourconsolidated financial statements.
In October 2016, the FASB issued an upda
te to its guidance on income tax  accounting. The new guidance replaces the prohibition against recognizing
current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the
asset has been sold to an outside party with a requirement to do so, unless
the asset transferred is inventory.
  January 1, 2018. Earlier applicationis permitted in the first interim
period of an annual reporting
period.
 We have not yet completed our review of the impact ofthis new guidance on our consolidated financial
statements. The impact of adoption will be recorded as
a cumulative effect adjustment to

    Standard/Description
 Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or OtherSignificant Matters
In January 2016, the FASB issued an update 
to its guidance on recognitionand measurement of 
financial assets and liabilities .   Among other things,the new guidance makes the following targeted changes to existing guidance:
1. Requires certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may
choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily
determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus
changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for
the identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
2. Requires a qualitative assessment of equity investments without readily
determinable fair values to identify impairment.
3. Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by
measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or
in the accompanying notes to the financial statements.
  January 1, 2018. Earlier applicationis permitted as of the beginning of
an interim or annual reporting
period.
 
We are assessing the impact of the provisions of thisnew guidance on our consolidated financial
statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the 
definition of a business 
. The new guidance provides a new framework for determining whether business development transactions should be accounted for as
acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. If the fair value of the
gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset, the
transaction will not qualify for treatment as a business. The new guidance also
requires that to be considered a business, a set of integrated activities and
assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that
together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, without regard
as to whether a market participant could replace missing elements. In
addition, the new guidance narrows the definition of the term "output" to
 makeit consistent with how outputs are described in the updated revenue
recognition guidance.
  January 1, 2018. Earlier applicationis permitted for acquisition or
derecognition events that occurred
prior to issuance date or effective
date of the guidance only when the
transaction has not been reported
in financial statements that have
been issued or made available for
issuance.
 
We have not yet completed our review of the impact ofthis guidance. However, we anticipate that after
adoption, fewer transactions will be accounted for as
business acquisitions (decreasing the amount of
goodwill incurred and potentially increasing IPR&D

In February 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance related to the
derecognition of nonfinancial assets.
 
January 1, 2018. Earlier applicationis permitted only as of annual
reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, including
interim reporting periods within that
reporting period. However, this
guidance must be applied at the
same time as the new guidance on
revenue recognition.
  We are assessing the impact of theprovisions of this new guidance on our
consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued an update to
 its guidance on leases . The new ASU provides guidance for both lessee and lessor accounting models.
Among other things, the new guidance requires that a right of use asset and
 alease liability be recognized for leases with a duration of greater than one
year.
  January 1, 2019. Earlier applicationis permitted.
 
We have not yet completed our review of the impact ofthis guidance. However, we anticipate recognition of
additional assets and corresponding liabilities related
to leases on our balance sheet.
In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting 
for credit losses of financial instruments 
. The new guidance replaces the incurred losses methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected
credit losses using an allowance account.
 January 1, 2020. Earlier applicationis permitted as of fiscal years
beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods
within that fiscal year.
  We have not yet completed our review of the impact ofthis new guidance on our consolidated financial
statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance for 
goodwill impairment testing 
. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment. Under
the new guidance the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the
fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and recognizing an
impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, although it cannot exceed the total
amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
  January 1, 2020. Earlier applicationis permitted.
 
We have not yet completed our review of the impact ofthis new guidance on our consolidated financial
statements.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized. Achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate
assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past
results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements, and are cautioned no
t to put unduereliance on forward-looking statements.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except
 as required by law or bythe rules and regulations of the SEC. You are advised, however, to consult
 any further disclosures we make on related subjects.Certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions are discussed here and under the heading entitled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A. of
 our Form 10-K for the year endedDecember 31, 2016 
. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible topredict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete se
t of all potential risks or uncertainties.The operating segment information provided in this report does not purport to represent the revenues, costs and income from continuing operations before provision for taxes
on income that each of our operating segments would have recorded had each segment operated as a standalone company during the
 periods presented.This report includes discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various in-line products and/or product candidates. These studies typically are part of a larger body of
clinical data relating to such products or product candidates, and the discussion herein should be considered in the context of 
the larger body of data. In addition, clinical trialdata are subject to differing interpretations, and, even when we view data as sufficient 
to support the safety and/or effectiveness of a product candidate or a new indication foran in-line product, regulatory authorities may not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval altogether.
Financial Risk Management
The objective of our financial risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings. We
manage these financial exposures through operational means and through the use of third-party instruments. These practices may change as economic conditions change.
Foreign Exchange Risk
We operate globally and, as such, we are subject to foreign exchange risk in our commercial operations, as well as in our financial assets (investments) and liabilities
(borrowings). Our net investments in foreign subsidiaries are also subject to currency risk.
On the commercial side, a significant portion of our revenues and earnings is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. See 
the “ Our Operating Environment — TheGlobal Economic Environment 
” section of this Financial Review for the key currencies in which we operate. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. Where
foreign exchange risk cannot be mitigated via operational means, we may use foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and/or foreign currency swaps to manage that risk.
With respect to our financial assets and liabilities, our primary foreign exchange exposure arises predominantly from short-term and long-term intercompany receivables and
payables, and, to a lesser extent, from short-term and long-term investments and debt, where the asse
ts and/or liabilities are denominated in currencies other than thefunctional currency of the business entity.
We also hedge some forecasted intercompany sales denominated in euro, Japanese yen, U.K. pound, Aus
tralian dollar, and Canadian dollar to protect against longer-termmovements.
In addition, under certain market conditions, we may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments o
f our foreign business entities. In these cases,we may use foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and/or foreign currency debt.
For details about these and other financial instruments, including fair valuation methodologies, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 7A. Financial Instruments: Selected Financial Assets and Liabilities 
. The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, holding
all other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the U.S.
 dollar would not have any effect on another currency’s rates relative tothe U.S. dollar, if the dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10%, as of 
December 31, 2016 , the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.
Interest Rate Risk
We are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and on our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on 
Pfizer’s immediate andintermediate liquidity needs.
2016 Financial Report    
 
 63
Financial ReviewPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    With respect to our investments, we strive to maintain a predominantly floating-rate basis position, but our strategy may change based on
 prevailing market conditions. Ourfloating-rate assets are subject to the risk that short-term interest rates may fall and, as a
 result, the investments would generate less interest income. Fixed-rate investmentsprovide a known amount of interest income regardless of a change in interest rates. We sometimes use interest rate swaps in our financial investment portfolio.
With respect to our long-term borrowings, we strive to maintain a predominantly floating-rate basis position, but here too, we may change our strategy depending upon
prevailing market conditions. We generally issue debt with a fixed rate, and then use interest rate swaps to convert it into
 floating-rate debt as we deem appropriate in thecircumstances. This effective floating rate debt serves to offset some o
f the interest rate risks associated with our short-term and floating-rate investments.For details about these and other financial instruments, including fair valuation methodologies, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 7A. Financial Instruments: Selected Financial Assets and Liabilities 
. The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, holding all other
assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments, if there were a one hundred basis point increase in
interest rates as of 
December 31, 2016 , the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant. Contingencies
Legal Matters
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other
product-related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications (see Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements— 
Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies). Certain of these contingencies could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, and/or criminal charges, which could be substantial.
We believe that our claims and defenses in these matters are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do no
t believe that anyof these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding
the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on
 our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/orour cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.
We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and,
 therefore,determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range o
f reasonably possible loss inexcess of amounts accrued. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that
 have been deemed reasonable by management, but the assessment processrelies heavily on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause
 us tochange those estimates and assumptions.
Tax Matters
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business for tax matters (see Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements— 
Note 5D. Tax Matters: Tax Contingencies). We account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If our initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of
 a tax benefit, we regularly monitor ourposition and subsequently recognize the tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that
 sufficiently raise the likelihood ofprevailing on the technical merits of the position to “more likely than not”; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable
settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. We regularly re-evaluate our tax positions based on 
the results of audits of federal, state and foreign income tax filings,statute of limitations expirations, changes in tax law or receipt of new information that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to 
the “more-likely-than-not” standard.
Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but
 our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potentialtax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such es
timates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or whenthe statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as
 discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formaladministrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to
 our uncertain tax positions, and suchchanges could be significant.

timates. We also accept responsibility for thepreparation of other financial information that is included in this document.
Report on Internal Control Ove
r Financial ReportingThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded asnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effec
t on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation o
f effectiveness tofuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresmay deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2016 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2016 . The Company’s independent auditors have issued their auditors’ report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. That report appears in our

Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee reviews Pfizer’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements
and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls.
The Committee met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the fair and complete presentation of Pfizer’s
results and the assessment of Pfizer’s internal control over financial reporting. We discussed significant accounting policies applied in Pfizer’s financial statements, as well as,
when applicable, alternative accounting treatments. Management represented to the Committee that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Committee reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management
and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed
under applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards.
In addition, the Committee reviewed and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the auditor’s independence from Pfizer and its management. As part
of that review, we received the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting
firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Committee discussed the independent registered public accounting firm’s independence
from Pfizer.
We also considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm’s provision of non-audit services to Pfizer is compatible with the auditor’s independence. The
Committee concluded that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent from Pfizer and its management.
As part of our responsibilities for oversight of Pfizer’s Enterprise Risk Management process, we reviewed and discussed company policies with respect to risk assessment and
risk management, including discussions of individual risk areas, as well as an annual summary of the overall process.
The Committee discussed with Pfizer’s Internal Audit Department and independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits.
The Committee meets with the Chief Internal Auditor, Chief Compliance and Risk Officer and representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm, in regular
and executive sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of 
Pfizer’s internal controls, and the overall quality of Pfizer’s financial reporting andcompliance programs.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors, and the 
Board has approved, that the auditedfinancial statements be included in Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2016 , for filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Committee has selected, and the Board of Directors has ratified, the selection of 
Pfizer’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2017 .

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on theConsolidated Financial Statements
 
The Board of Directors and Sha
reholders of Pfizer Inc.:We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. and 
Subsidiary Companies as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in 
the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 . These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan andperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. 
An audit includes examining, on a test basis,evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm onInternal Control Over Financial Reporting
 
The Board of Directors and Sha
reholders of Pfizer Inc.:We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies as of December 31, 
2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control 
— Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan andperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
 the assets ofthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
 thecompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation o
f effectiveness tofuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresmay deteriorate.

 2016 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
A. Basis of Presentation
See the Glossary of Defined Terms at the beginning of this 2016 Financial Report for terms used throughout
 the consolidated financial statements and related notes of this2016 Financial Report.
The consolidated financial statements include our parent company and all subsidiaries, and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The decision of
 whether or not to consolidate an entity requires consideration of majority voting interests, as well as effective economicor other control over the entity. Typically, we do not seek control by means other than vo
ting interests. For subsidiaries operating outside the U.S., the financial information isincluded as of and for the year ended November 30 for each year presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S.
 subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended December 31 for eachyear presented. Substantially all unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries are free of legal and contractual restrictions. All significant transactions among our businesses
have been eliminated. Taxes paid on intercompany sales transactions are deferred until recognized upon sale of the asset to a third party.
In the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended
 December 31, 2015 and 2014, we performed reclassifications to conform to the current period presentationthat cash paid by us when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes is presented as cash outflows from financing activities, rather than operating activities in
accordance with the adoption of a new accounting standard. For additional information, see 
Note 1B . In the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, we performed certain reclassifications to conform to the
 current period presentation of Other current assets , Othernoncurrent assets 
, Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt , and in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the  yearsended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we performed certain reclassifications to conform to the current presentation of 
Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures 
, Principal payments on short-term borrowings, and Principal payments on long-term debt, for debt issuance costs in accordance with the adoption of a new accounting standard. For additional information, see 
Note 1B . We manage our commercial operations through 
two distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH), which was previously known asEstablished Products. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, we reorganized our operating segments to reflect 
that we now manage our innovative pharmaceutical andconsumer healthcare operations as one business segment, IH. From the beginning of our fiscal year 2014 until the second quarter of 2016
, these operations were managed astwo 
business segments: the GIP segment and the VOC segment. We have revised prior-period segment information to reflect the reorganization. For additional information,see 
Note 18 . On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion therapy net assets,
 HIS, to ICU Medical, a global device manufacturer, for up to approximately $900 million , composed of cash and contingent cash consideration, ICU Medical common stock and seller financing. HIS includes IV pumps, solutions and devices. We
 have agreed tocertain restrictions on transfer of our ICU Medical shares for 
18 months. Assets and liabilities associated with HIS are presented as held for sale in the consolidated balancesheet as of December 31, 2016. For additional information, see 
Note 2B. On September 28, 2016, we acquired Medivation for 
$81.50 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Medivation was approximately $14.3 billion in cash ( $13.9 billion 
, net of cash acquired). Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets , liabilities, operating results and cash flows ofMedivation, and, in accordance with our domestic reporting periods, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 
2016 reflect approximately three months of legacy Medivation operations. For additional information, see 
Note 2A . On June 24, 2016, we acquired Anacor for 
$99.25 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Anacor was approximately $4.9 billion in cash ( $4.5 billion , net of cash acquired), plus 
$698 million debt assumed. Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Anacor, and, in accordance with our domestic reporting periods, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 
2016 reflect approximately six months of legacy Anacor operations, which were immaterial 
. For additional information, see Note 2A. On April 6, 2016, we announced that the merger agreement between Pfizer and Allergan entered into on
 November 22, 2015 was terminated by mutual agreement of thecompanies. The decision was driven by the actions announced by the U.S. Department of Treasury on April 4, 2016
, which the companies concluded qualified as an “AdverseTax Law Change” under the merger agreement. In connection with the termination of the merger agreement, on April 8, 2016 (which fell into Pfizer’s second fiscal quarter),
Pfizer paid Allergan 
$150 million (pre-tax) for reimbursement of Allergan’s expenses associated with the terminated transaction (see Note 4 ). Pfizer and Allergan also released each other from any and all claims in connection with the merger agreement.
On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira for approximately 
$16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). Commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Hospira. In accordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31,

    B. Adoption of New Acco
unting StandardsIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted a new accoun
ting standard for certain elements of the accounting for share-based payments as of January 1, 2016. Specifically, thenew standard requires excess tax benefits or deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividend equivalents) of shared-based compensation to be recognized as a component of
the 
Provision for taxes on income , whereas excess tax benefits or deficiencies previously were recognized in Additional paid-in capital . The net tax benefit for the Company was 
$89 million for full-year 2016. The standard requires the modified retrospective transition method of adoption, and as such, does not  permit retroactive presentation of thisbenefit to prior fiscal years in the consolidated statements of income. Further, the net
 cumulative effect of excess tax benefits not previously recognized because they had notreduced taxes payable, was 
$13 million and is reflected as an increase to Retained earnings as of January 1, 2016. Another element of the new accounting standard is within our consolidated statements of cash 
flows, which now present excess tax benefits as operating activities. We haveelected to adopt this presentation on a prospective basis as of January 1,
 2016, and, therefore, our consolidated statement of cash flows for fiscal years prior to 2016 have notbeen adjusted for this element. Additionally, cash paid by us when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes is now a cash outflow from financing activities. This
reclassification is required to be adopted retrospectively. As a result, 
$137 million for 2016 is presented as financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows, and cash outflows of 
$189 million for 2015 and $195 million for 2014 were reclassified from operating activities to financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, respectively. We also elected to continue to estimate the impact of expected
 forfeitures of share-based payments when determining the amount of compensation cost to berecognized each period, rather than account for forfeitures as they occur. Finally, in the 2016 diluted net
 earnings per share calculation, when applying the treasury stockmethod for shares that could be repurchased, the assumed proceeds no longer include the amount of excess 
tax benefit.We adopted a new accounting standard as of January 1, 2016 tha
t changed the presentation of debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deductionfrom the carrying value of that associated debt, consistent with the presenta
tion of a debt discount. The update does not impact the measurement or recognition of debtissuance costs. As of 
December 31, 2016 , debt issuance costs were $115 million and are presented as contra-liabilities to Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt 
( $1 million ) and Long-term debt ( $114 million ). In the December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet, we have reclassified debt issuance costs of $79 million ( 
$1 million from Other current assets and $79 million from Other noncurrent assets ) and have presented them as contra-liabilities to Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt 
( $1 million ) and Long-term debt ( $79 million ) to conform to the current period presentation. For additional information, see Note 7A. We adopted a new accounting standard as of January 1, 2016 tha
t requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments made in the measurement period to provisional amounts ofassets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. There was no material impact to our
consolidated financial statements in 2016 from adopting this standard. For additional information, see 
Note 2A. We adopted a new standard as of January 1, 2016 related to 
the accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued or held as investments and there was no material impact toour consolidated financial statements from adopting this standard.
C. Estimates and Assumptions
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions that affec
t reported amounts and disclosures, including amounts recorded anddisclosed in connection with acquisitions. These estimates and underlying assumptions can impact all elements of our financial statements. For example, in the consolidated
statements of income, estimates are used when accounting for deductions from revenues (such as rebates, chargebacks,
 sales allowances and sales returns), determining thecost of inventory that is sold, allocating cost in the form of depreciation and amortization, and
 estimating restructuring charges and the impact of contingencies. On theconsolidated balance sheets, estimates are used in determining the valuation and recoverability of assets, such as accounts receivable, investments, inventories, de
ferred taxassets, fixed assets and intangible assets (including acquired IPR&D assets), and estimates are used in determining the reported amounts of
 liabilities, such as taxes payable,benefit obligations, accruals for contingencies, rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns, and restructuring reserves, all of which also impact the consolidated
statements of income.
Our estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but
 that can be inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If ourestimates and assumptions are not representative of actual outcomes, our results could be materially impacted.
As future events and their effects cannot be
 determined with precision, our estimates and assumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, or unanticipated events andcircumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. We are subject
 to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differfrom estimated amounts, such as changes in the healthcare environment, competition, litigation, legislation and regulations. We regularly evaluate our estimates and
assumptions using historical experience and expectations about the future. We adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts
 and circumstances indicate the need forchange. Those changes generally will be reflected in our financial statements on a prospective basis, unless they are required to be treated retrospectively under relevant
accounting standards. It is possible that others, applying reasonable judgment to the same fac
ts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimatedamounts.
D. Acquisitions
Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. We
 account for acquired businesses using theacquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of 
theacquisition date and that the fair value of acquired IPR&D be recorded on the balance shee
t. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the considerationtransferred over the assigned values of the net
76
 
 2016 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. When we acquire net assets that do not constitute a business,
 as defined in U.S. GAAP, no goodwill is recognized and acquiredIPR&D is expensed.
Contingent consideration in a business combination is included as part of the acquisition cost and is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date
. Fair value is generallyestimated by using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach. Any liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date
until the contingency is resolved. These changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . Amounts recorded in connection with an acquisition can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. E. Fair Value
We are often required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting. For example, we use fair
value extensively in the initial recognition of net assets acquired in a business combination, when measuring certain impairment losses and when accounting for and reporting
of certain financial instruments. We estimate fair value using an exit price approach, which requires, among other things, that we determine the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The determination of an exit price is considered from the perspective of market participants, considering the
highest and best use of non-financial assets and, for liabilities, assuming that the risk of non-performance will be the same before and af
ter the transfer.When estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, we may use one or all of 
the following techniques:•
Income approach, which is based on the present value of a future stream of net cash flows.•
Market approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.•
Cost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets, less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence.For some investments, if certain conditions exist, we may employ a practical expedient wherein we use the NAV per share (or its equivalent), as fair value. When this practical
expedient is used, the NAV is not categorized for disclosure purposes within the fair value hierarchy for types of inputs used
 for valuation.Our fair value methodologies depend on the following types of inputs:
•
Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs).•
Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other thanquoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means
(Level 2 inputs).
•
Unobservable inputs that reflect estimates and assumptions (Level 3 inputs).A single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and
 can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Forinformation about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. F. Foreign Currency Translation
For most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their
U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the
 balance sheet date and we translate functional currency income and expense amounts to their U.S. dollarequivalents at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects 
that arise from changing translation rates are recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss) . The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet da
te, with translation adjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions–– net 
, and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.G. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable
Revenue Recognition 
—We record revenues from product sales when the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer. A t the time of sale, we also record estimates fora variety of revenue deductions, such as chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. When we cannot reasonably estimate 
the amount of future sales returnsand/or other revenue deductions, we record revenues when the risk of product return and/or additional revenue deductions has been substantially eliminated.
Deductions from Revenues–– 
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, that generally are estimated and recorded in the  same period that therevenues are recognized, and primarily represent chargebacks, rebates and sales allowances to wholesalers, and, to a lesser extent, distributors like managed care
organizations, retailers and government agencies with respect to our pharmaceutical products. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such,
knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Specifically:
•
In the U.S., we record provisions for pharmaceutical Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid andactual prescriptions written during prior quarters. We apply the experience ratio to the respective
2016 Financial Report    
 
 77
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    period’s sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trends are as current as
practicable. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare “coverage gap,” also known as the “doughnut hole,”
based on the historical experience of beneficiary prescriptions and consideration of the utilization that is expected to result from the discount in 
the coverage gap. Weevaluate this estimate regularly to ensure that the historical trends and future expectations are as current as practicable. For performance-based contract rebates
, we alsoconsider current contract terms, such as changes in formulary status and rebate rates.
•
Outside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales allowances are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales withineach period, which reduces the risk of variations in the estimation process. In certain European countries, rebates are calculated on the government’s to
tal unbudgetedpharmaceutical spending or on specific product sales thresholds, and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level
of reimbursement. We obtain third-party information that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals.
•
Provisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties) closely approximate actual as wesettle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.
•
Provisions for pharmaceutical sales returns are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices;historical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; es
timated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time betweenshipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate o
f future returns, such as loss of exclusivity, product recalls or a changing competitiveenvironment. Generally, returned products are destroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.
•
We record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered, whichever is later. We estimate thecost of our sales incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.
Our accruals for Medicare rebates, Medicaid and related state program rebates, performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and
cash discounts totaled 
$4.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 , of which approximately $2.8 billion is included in Other current liabilities, $357 million is included in Other noncurrent liabilities 
and approximately $1.2 billion is included against Trade accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts , in our consolidated balance sheet. Our accruals for Medicare rebates, Medicaid and related state program rebates, performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash
discounts totaled 
$3.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 , of which approximately $2.6 billion is included in Other current liabilities, $272 million is included in Other noncurrent liabilities 
and approximately $1.1 billion is included against Trade accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts , in our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can
 rely heavily on estimates andassumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from 
Revenues . Collaborative Arrangements— 
Payments to and from our collaboration partners are presented in our consolidated statements of income based on the nature o f thearrangement (including its contractual terms), the nature of the payments and applicable accounting guidance. Under co-promotion agreements, we record the amounts
received from our collaboration partners as alliance revenues, a component of 
Revenues, when our collaboration partners are the principal in the transaction and we receive a share of their net sales or profits. Alliance revenues are recorded when our collaboration partners ship the product and title passes to their customer. The related expenses 
forselling and marketing these products are included in 
Selling, informational and administrative expenses. In collaborative arrangements where we manufacture a product for our collaboration partners, we record revenues when our collaboration partners sell the product and title passes to their customers. All royalty payments to collaboration partners
are included in 
Cost of sales . Royalty payments received from collaboration partners are included in Other (income)/deductions—net. Trade Accounts Receivable 
—Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance against gross trade accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other
current information. Trade accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been
exhausted.
H. Cost of Sales and Inventories
We carry inventories at the lower of cost or market. The cost of finished goods, work in process and raw materials is determined using average actual cost. We
 regularly reviewour inventories for impairment and reserves are established when necessary.
I. Selling, Informational and Administ
rative ExpensesSelling, informational and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Among other things, these expenses include the internal and external costs of marketing, advertising,
shipping and handling, information technology and legal defense.
Advertising expenses totaled approximately 
$3.2 billion in 2016 , $3.1 billion in 2015 and $3.1 billion in 2014 . Production costs are expensed as incurred and the costs of radio time, television time and space in publications are expensed when the related advertising occurs.
J. Research and Development Expenses
R&D costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary R&D efforts, as well as costs
 incurred in connection with certain licensingarrangements. Before a compound receives regulatory approval, we record upfront and milestone payments made by us
78
 
 2016 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    to third parties under licensing arrangements as expense. Upfront payments are recorded when incurred, and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone
has been achieved. Once a compound receives regulatory approval, we record any milestone payments in 
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization and, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite life, we amortize the payments on a straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product
 lifecycle, whichever is shorter.
R&D expenses related to upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights totaled 
$82 million in 2016 , $429 million in 2015 and $1.4 billion in 2014 . For additional information, see 
Note 2C and Note 2D . K. Amortization of Intangible 
Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets include:
•
Property, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation —These assets are recorded at cost and are increased by the cost of any  significant improvements afterpurchase. Property, plant and equipment assets, other than land and construction in progress, are depreciated on
 a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of theindividual assets. Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax laws.
•
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization —These acquired assets are recorded at cost. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives that are associated with marketed products are not amortized until a useful life can be
determined. Intangible assets associated with IPR&D projects are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the 
EU, or in aseries of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. The useful life of an amortizing asset generally is determined by identifying the
period in which substantially all of the cash flows are expected to be generated.
•
Goodwill —Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired business over the assigned values of its net assets . Goodwill is not amortized.Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds
and intellectual property is included in 
Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to intangible assets that are associated with a single function and depreciation of property, plant and equipment are included in 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses 
and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate. We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least
annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the
amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.
Specifically:
•
For finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairmentindicators are present, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset
, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount tothe carrying amount. If the carrying amount is found to be greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess o
f book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of animpairment review, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.
•
For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as Brands and IPR&D assets, when necessary, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any,for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an
 impairment review other than for IPR&D assets, we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterizethe asset as indefinite-lived is appropriate.
•
For goodwill, when necessary, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare that value to its book value. If the carrying amount is found to be greater, wethen determine the implied fair value of goodwill by subtracting the fair value of all the identifiable net assets other than goodwill from the fair value of 
the reporting unit andrecord an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the book value of goodwill over the implied fair value.
Impairment reviews can involve a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For information about
the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. L. Restructuring Charges and 
Certain Acquisition-Related CostsWe may incur restructuring charges in connection with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations or in connection with our
cost-reduction and productivity initiatives. Included in 
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs are all restructuring charges, as well as certain other costs associated with acquiring and integrating an acquired business. If the restructuring action results in a change in the estimated useful life of
 an asset, that incremental impact isclassified in 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate. Termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable. Transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other costs incurred in connection with a business
acquisition are expensed as incurred 
. Amounts recorded for restructuring charges and other associated costs can result from a complex series of judgments about future events
 and uncertainties and can relyheavily on estimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. 2016 Financial Report

    M. Cash Equivalents and Statement of 
Cash FlowsCash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of three months or less when purchased. 
Ifitems meeting this definition are part of a larger investment pool, we classify them as 
Short-term investments . Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges may be included in operating, investing or financing activities, depending on the
classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified according to the na
ture of thehedge instrument. Cash flows associated with financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are classified according to 
their purpose and accountingnature.
N. Investments and Derivative Financial Inst
rumentsOur investments are comprised of the following: trading funds and securities, available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities (when we have both the positive intent and
ability to hold the investment to maturity) and private equity securities. The classification of an investment can depend on
 the nature of the investment, our intent and ability tohold the investment, and the degree to which we may exercise influence.
•
Trading securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions—net. •
Available-for-sale debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss) until realized. •
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried at amortized cost.•
Private equity securities are carried at equity-method or at cost-method. For equity investments where we have significant influence over the financial and operating policiesof the investee, we use the equity-method of accounting. Under the
 equity-method, we record our share of the investee’s income and expenses in Other (income)/deductions —net 
. The excess of the cost of the  investment over our share of the equity of the investee as of the acquisition date is allocated to the identifiable assets of the investee,with any remaining excess amount allocated to goodwill. Such investments are initially recorded at cost, which typically does not include amounts of contingent
consideration.
Realized gains or losses on sales of investments are determined by using the specific identification cost method.
We regularly evaluate all of our financial assets for impairment. For investments in debt and equity securities, when a decline in fair value, if any, is determined to be other-
than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value in various balance sheet categories (see 
Note 7A ), with changes in fair value reported in Net income or, for derivative financial instruments in certain qualifying hedging relationships, in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) (see Note 7E ). A single estimate of fair value and impairment reviews can involve a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. O. Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies
Current tax assets primarily includes (i) tax effects associated with intercompany transfers of assets within our consolidated group, which are recognized in the consolidated
statement of income when the asset transferred is sold to a third-party or recovered through amortization of the asse
t's remaining economic life; and (ii) income tax receivablesthat are expected to be recovered either as refunds from taxing authorities or as a reduction to
 future tax obligations.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between 
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilitiesusing enacted tax rates and laws. We provide a valuation allowance when we believe that our deferred tax assets are not recoverable based on an
 assessment of estimatedfuture taxable income that incorporates ongoing, prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary, to
 realize the deferred tax assets. Alldeferred tax assets and liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction are presented as a net amount in the noncurrent section of our consolidated balance sheet.
We account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If we consider that a 
tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based solely onthe technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit
 by determining the amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that
 has full knowledge of all relevant information.Under the benefit recognition model, if our initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the
tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of 
theposition to “more likely than not”; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable settlement of tha
t tax year with theappropriate agency. We regularly re-evaluate our tax positions based on the results of audits of federal, state and
 foreign income tax filings, statute of limitations expirations,changes in tax law or receipt of new information that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the more-likely-than-not standard. Liabilities
associated with uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash within the next 12 months
. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded inProvision for taxes on income 
and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related tax liability. Amounts recorded for valuation allowances and income tax contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely
heavily on estimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see

    P. Pension and P
ostretirement Benefit PlansThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have
 both qualified andsupplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees.
We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined bene
fit plans as an asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet. The obligations aregenerally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and
other postretirement obligations may include assumptions such as expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the obligation may also include
assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the
 expected cost of providing medicalinsurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the
 employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are measured at fairvalue. Net periodic benefit costs are recognized, as required, into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses 
, as appropriate. Amounts recorded for pension and postretirement benefit plans can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
 uncertainties and can rely heavily onestimates and assumptions. For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. Q. Legal and Environmental Contingencies
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other
product-related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. We record accruals for
these contingencies to the extent that we conclude tha
t a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimatethan any other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no
 amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount,we accrue the lowest amount in the range. We record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.
Amounts recorded for contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and
 assumptions.For information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. R. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values
are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses

Acquisitions, Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Agreements, Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment
A. Acquisitions
Medivation, Inc.
On September 28, 2016, we acquired Medivation for 
$81.50 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Medivation was approximately $14.3 billion in cash ( $13.9 billion 
, net of cash acquired). Of this consideration, approximately $365 million was not paid as of December 31, 2016, and was recorded in Other current liabilities. Medivation is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Medivation is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small molecules for oncology.
Medivation’s portfolio includes Xtandi (enzalutamide), an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells.
Xtandi is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration between Pfizer and Astellas. Astellas has exclusive commercialization rights for Xtandi outside the U.S.
In addition, Medivation has two development-stage oncology assets in its pipeline: talazoparib, which is currently in a Phase 3 study for the 
treatment of BRCA-mutated breastcancer, and pidilizumab, an immuno-oncology asset being developed for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies. In connection with this acquisition,
we provisionally recorded 
$13.1 billion in Identifiable intangible assets , primarily consisting of $8.7 billion of Developed technology rights with an average useful life of approximately 
12 years and $4.4 billion of IPR&D, and provisionally recorded $5.5 billion of Goodwill, $4.4 billion of net deferred tax liabilities, and $340 million of assumed contingent consideration. We recorded changes in the estimated fair values recognized in the measurement period to better reflect market participant assumptions about fac
tsand circumstances existing as of the acquisition date. The allocation of the consideration transferred to the
 assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has not yet beenfinalized.
Bamboo Therapeutics, Inc.
On August 1, 2016, we acquired all the remaining equity in Bamboo, a privately-held biotechnology company focused on developing gene therapies for the po
tential treatmentof patients with certain rare diseases relating to neuromuscular conditions and those affecting the central nervous system, for 
$150 million , plus potential milestone payments of up to 
$495 million contingent upon the progression of key assets through development, regulatory approval and commercialization. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Bamboo was approximately 
$331 million , including cash of $130 million ( $101 million , net of cash acquired), contingent consideration of $157 million , consisting of milestone payments, and the fair value of Pfizer’s previously held equity interest in Bamboo of 
$44 million . We previously 2016 Financial Report

    purchased a minority stake in Bamboo in the first quarter of 2016 for a payment of approximately 
$43 million . Upon acquiring the remaining interest in Bamboo, we recognized a gain of 
$1 million on our existing investment in Other (income)/deductions––net. This acquisition provides us with several clinical and pre-clinical assets that complement our rare disease portfolio, an advanced recombinant AAV vector design and production technology, and a fully functional Phase
 I/II gene therapy manufacturing facility. Bamboo isnow a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. In connection with this acquisition, we provisionally recorded 
$325 million of Identifiable intangible assets, consisting entirely of IPR&D. 
We also provisionally recorded $133 million of Goodwill and $93 million of net deferred tax liabilities. The allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized.
Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
On June 24, 2016, we acquired Anacor for 
$99.25 per share. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Anacor was approximately $4.9 billion in cash ( $4.5 billion net of cash acquired), plus 
$698 million debt assumed. Anacor is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Anacor is a biopharmaceutical company focused on novel small- molecule therapeutics derived from its boron chemistry platform. Anacor’s crisaborole, a non-steroidal topical PDE-4 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties, was approved
by the FDA on December 14, 2016 under the trade name, Eucrisa. In connec
tion with this acquisition, we recorded $698 million as the fair value of notes payable in cash, and provisionally recorded 
$4.9 billion in Identifiable intangible assets , primarily consisting of $4.8 billion of IPR&D , and provisionally recorded $647 million of Goodwill and $352million 
of net deferred tax liabilities. We recorded changes in the estimated fair values recognized in the measurement period to better reflect market participant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date. We do
 not expect significant adjustments to the allocation of the consideration transferred to the assetsacquired and the liabilities assumed, however the assessment has not yet been finalized.
Hospira, Inc.
On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira, a leading provider of sterile injectable drugs and infusion technologies as well as a provider of biosimilars, for 
$90 per share incash. The total fair value of consideration transferred for Hospira was approximately 
$16.1 billion in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). Hospira is now a subsidiary of Pfizer and its commercial operations are included in the EH segment. The combination of local Pfizer and Hospira entities may be pending in various jurisdictions and
integration is subject to completion of various local legal and regulatory steps.
Hospira’s principal business was the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of generic 
acute-care and oncology injectables, biosimilars and integrated infusion therapy and medication management systems (see 
Note 2B below). Hospira’s broad portfolio of products is used by hospitals and alternate site providers, such as clinics, home healthcare providers and long-term care facilities. We believe our 
acquisition of Hospira has strengthened our EH business, as EH now has a broadened portfolio of generic and branded sterile injectables, marketed biosimilars and biosimilars in development.
The following table summarizes the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, as well as adjustments made in 2016 to the
amounts initially recorded in 2015 (measurement period adjustments) with a corresponding change to goodwill. The measurement period adjustments did not have a material
impact on our earnings in any period. The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has been completed.

    As of the acquisition date, the fair value of accounts
 receivable approximated the book value acquired. The gross contractual amount receivable was $565 million , of which $12 million 
was not expected to be collected. In the ordinary course of business, Hospira incurs liabilities for environmental, legal and tax matters, as well as guarantees and indemnifications. These matters may include
contingencies. Except as specifically excluded by the relevant accounting standard, contingencies are required to be measured at fair value as of
 the acquisition date if theacquisition-date fair value of the asset or liability arising from a contingency can be determined. If the acquisition-date fair value of the asset
 or liability cannot be determined,the asset or liability would be recognized at the acquisition date if both of the following criteria are met: (i) it is probable that an asset
 existed or that a liability had been incurredat the acquisition date, and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated.
•
Environmental Matters —In the ordinary course of business, Hospira incurs liabilities for environmental matters such as remediation work, asset retirement obligations and environmental guarantees and indemnifications. The contingencies for environmental matters are not significant to Pfizer’s financial statements.
•
Legal Matters —Hospira is involved in various legal proceedings, including product liability, patent, commercial, antitrust and environmental matters and government investigations, of a nature considered normal to its business. The contingencies arising from legal matters are not significant to Pfizer’s financial statements.
•
Tax Matters —In the ordinary course of business, Hospira incurs liabilities for income taxes . Income taxes are exceptions to both the recognition and fair valuemeasurement principles associated with the accounting for business combinations. Reserves for income tax contingencies continue to be measured under the benefit
recognition model as previously used by Hospira. Net liabilities for income taxes approximate 
$3.4 billion as of the acquisition date, which includes $109 million for uncertain tax positions. The net tax liability includes the recording of additional adjustments of approximately 
$3.2 billion for the tax impact of fair value adjustments and approximately $719 million 
for income tax matters that we intend to resolve in a manner different from what Hospira had planned or intended. For example, because we plan to repatriatecertain overseas funds, we provided deferred taxes on Hospira’s unremitted earnings for which no taxes have been previously provided by Hospira as it was Hospira’s
intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings.
Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the 
future economic benefits arising from other assetsacquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Hospira includes the following:
•
the expected specific synergies and other benefits that we believe will result from combining the operations of Hospira with the operations of Pfizer;•
any intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, as well as future, as yet unidentified projects and products; and•
the value of the going-concern element of Hospira’s existing businesses (the higher rate of return on the assembled collection of net assets versus if Pfizer had acquired allof the net assets separately).
Goodwill is not amortized and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill related to the acquisition of Hospira is related to our EH segment
 (see Note 10 for additional information).
Actual and Pro Forma Impact of Acquisition

    The unaudited supplemental pro forma consolidated results reflect the historical financial information of Pfizer and Hospira, adjusted to give effect to the
 acquisition of Hospiraas if it had occurred on January 1, 2014, primarily for the following pre-tax adjustments:
•
Elimination of Hospira’s historical intangible asset amortization expense (approximately $33 million in 2015 and $77 million in 2014). •
Additional amortization expense (approximately $342 million in 2015 and $502 million in 2014) related to the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired. •
Additional depreciation expense (approximately $52 million in 2015 and $102 million in 2014) related to the fair value adjustment to PP&E acquired. •
Adjustment related to the non-recurring fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventory estimated to have been sold (the elimination of $364 million of charges in 2015 and the addition of 
$591 million of charges in 2014). •
Adjustment to decrease interest expense (approximately $18 million in 2015 and $42 million in 2014) related to the fair value adjustment of Hospira debt. •
Adjustment for non-recurring acquisition-related costs directly attributable to the acquisition (the elimination of $877 million of charges in 2015, and the addition of $877 million 
of charges in 2014), reflecting non-recurring charges incurred by both Hospira and Pfizer which would have been recorded in 2014 under the pro forma assumption that the Hospira acquisition was completed on January 1, 2014.
The above adjustments were adjusted for the applicable tax impact. The taxes associated with the adjustments
 related to the fair value adjustment for acquired intangibleassets, PP&E, inventory and debt reflect 
the statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions where the adjustments are expected to be incurred. The taxes associated withelimination of Hospira’s historical intangible asset amortization expense and the adjustment for the acquisition-related costs directly attributable to the acquisition were based
on the tax rate in the jurisdiction in which the related deductible costs were incurred.
Marketed Vaccines Business of Baxter International Inc.
On December 1, 2014 (which fell in the first fiscal quarter of 2015 for our international operations), we acquired Baxter 
’ s portfolio of marketed vaccines for a final purchaseprice of 
$648 million . The portfolio that was acquired consists of NeisVac-C and FSME-IMMUN/TicoVac. NeisVac-C is a vaccine that helps protect against meningitis caused by group C meningococcal meningitis and FSME-IMMUN/TicoVac is a vaccine that helps protect against tick-borne encephalitis. In connection with this acquisition, we
recorded 
$376 million in Identifiable intangible assets, primarily consisting of $371 million in Developed technology rights. We also recorded $194 million of Inventories and $12 million 
in Goodwill . The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has been completed. InnoPharma, Inc.
On September 24, 2014, we completed our acquisition of InnoPharma, a privately-held pharmaceutical development company, for an upfront cash payment o
f $225 million and contingent consideration with an estimated acquisition-date fair value of approximately 
$67 million . The contingent consideration consists of up to $135 million in additional milestone payments based on application filing with, and acceptance by, the FDA, or approval of marketing applications related to certain pipeline products by the
FDA. We believe this acquisition represents a potential innovative growth opportunity for our sterile injectables portfolio in areas such as oncology and central nervous
disorders. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded 
$247 million in Identifiable intangible assets consisting of $212 million in IPR&D and $35 million in Developedtechnology rights 
; $81 million in net deferred tax liabilities; and $125 million in Goodwill . The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed has been completed.
B. Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale
On October 6, 2016, we announced that we entered into
 a definitive agreement under which ICU Medical agreed to acquire all of our global infusion therapy net assets, HIS,for approximately 
$1 billion in cash and ICU Medical common stock. HIS includes IV pumps, solutions, and devices. As a result o f recent performance of HIS relative to ICUMedical’s expectations, on January 5, 2017 we entered into a revised agreement with ICU Medical under which ICU Medical would acquire HIS for up to approximately 
$900 million 
, composed of cash and contingent cash consideration, ICU Medical common stock and seller financing. The revised transaction closed on February 3, 2017. At closing, under the terms of the
 revised agreement, we received 3.2 million newly issued shares of ICU Medical common stock (as originally agreed), which we valued at approximately 
$430 million (based upon the closing price of ICU Medical common stock on the closing date less a discount for lack of marketability), a promissory note in the amount of 
$75 million and net cash of approximately $200 million before customary adjustments for net working capital. In addition, we are entitled to receive a contingent amount of up to an additional 
$225 million in cash based on ICU Medical’s achievement of certain cumulative performance targets for the combined company through December 31, 2019. After receipt of ICU Medical shares, we own approximately 
16.4% of ICU Medical as of the closing date. We have agreed to certain restrictions on transfer of our ICU Medical shares for 
18 months. The promissory note from ICU Medical has a term of three years and bears interest at LIBOR plus 
2.25% for the first year and LIBOR plus 2.50% for the second and third years. While we have received the full purchase price excluding the contingent amount as of the February 3, 2017 closing, the sale o
f the HIS net assets was not completed in certainnon-U.S. jurisdictions due to temporary regulatory or operational constraints. In these jurisdictions, which represent a relatively small portion of the HIS net assets, we continue
to operate the net assets for the net
 economic benefit of ICU Medical, and we are indemnified by ICU Medical against any risk associated with such operations during theinterim period. We expect the sale of the HIS net assets in 
these jurisdictions to be completed by the first quarter of 2018. As such, and as we have already received all of thenon-contingent proceeds from the sale and ICU Medical is contractually obligated to complete the transaction, we have treated these jurisdictions as sold for accounting
purposes.
In connection with the sale transaction, we entered into certain transitional agreements designed to facilitate the orderly transition of 
the HIS net assets to ICU Medical. Theseagreements primarily relate to administrative services, which are generally to be provided for a period
84
 
 2016 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    of up to 
24 months. We will also manufacture and supply certain HIS products for ICU Medical and ICU Medical will manufacture and supply certain retained Pfizer products forus after closing, generally for a term of 
five years. These agreements are not material to Pfizer and none confers upon us the ability to influence the operating and/or financialpolicies of ICU Medical subsequent to the sale.
At 
December 31, 2016 , we determined that the carrying value of the HIS net assets  held for sale exceeded their fair value less estimated costs to sell, resulting in a pre-taximpairment charge of 
$1.7 billion , which is included in Other (income)/deductions––net (see Note 4 ). The decline in value resulted from lower expectations as to future cash flows to be generated by HIS, primarily as a result of an increase in competition for customer contracts and pricing factors that
 were not initially anticipated.Assets and liabilities associated with HIS are presented as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of 
December 31, 2016 . The HIS assets held for sale are reported in 
Assets held for sale and HIS liabilities held for sale are reported in Other current liabilities . The amounts associated with HIS, as well as other assets classified as held for sale as of 
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , consisted of the following:

 Other assets held for sale consist primarily of PP&E and other assets.C. Licensing Agreements
Cellectis SA (Cellectis)
In June 2014, we entered into a global arrangement with Cellectis to develop Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell immunotherapies in the field of oncology directed at select
cellular surface antigen targets. In August 2014, in connection with this licensing agreement, we made an upfront payment
 of $80 million to Cellectis, which was recorded in Research and development expenses 
. We will also fund R&D costs associated with up to 15 Pfizer-selected targets and, for the benefit of Cellectis, a portion of the R&D costsassociated with 
four Cellectis-selected targets within the arrangement. Cellectis is eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to$185 million 
per product that results from the Pfizer-selected targets, as well as tiered royalties on net sales of any  products that are commercialized by Pfizer. In addition, inAugust 2014, we acquired approximately 
10% of the capital of Cellectis through the purchase of newly issued shares, for a total investment  of approximately $35 million . As of November 30, 2016 and 2015, Pfizer’s ownership in Cellectis’ outstanding shares was approximately 
8% .Nexium Over-the-Counter Rights
In August 2012, we entered into an agreement with AstraZeneca for 
the exclusive, global, OTC rights for Nexium, a prescription drug approved to treat the symptoms ofgastroesophageal reflux disease. In connection with this Consumer Healthcare licensing agreement, we made an upfront payment of 
$250 million to AstraZeneca, which was recorded in 
Research and development expenses when incurred. On May 27, 2014, we launched Nexium 24HR in the U.S., and on July 11, 2014,  we paid AstraZeneca arelated 
$200 million product launch milestone payment. On August 1, 2014, we launched Nexium Control in Europe, and on Sep tember 15, 2014, we paid AstraZeneca arelated 
$50 million product launch milestone payment. These post-approval milestone payments were recorded in Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization and are being amortized over the estimated useful life of the Nexium brand. Included in 
Other current liabilities at December 31, 2015 are accrued milestone payments to AstraZeneca of 
$93 million , which were subsequently paid to AstraZeneca in April 2016. AstraZeneca is eligible to receive additional milestone payments of approximately $200 million 
, based on the level of worldwide sales as well as quarterly royalty payments based on worldwide sales. 2016 Financial Report

    D. Research and Development and Collabo
rative ArrangementsResearch and Development Arrangement with NovaQuest Co-Investment Fund II, L.P.
On November 1, 2016, we announced the discontinuation of the global clinical development program for bococizumab. During December 2016, 
$31.3 million was refunded to NovaQuest representing amounts NovaQuest prepaid for development costs (under the May 2016 agreement described below) that were not used for program expenses due
to the discontinuation of the development program. No additional payments are expected to be received from or paid to NovaQues
t under this agreement, which was effectivelyterminated on November 18, 2016.
In May 2016, our agreement with NovaQuest became effective, under which NovaQuest agreed to 
fund up to $250 million in development costs related to certain Phase III clinical trials of Pfizer’s bococizumab compound and Pfizer agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for such compound.
NovaQuest’s development funding was expected to cover up to 
40% of the development costs and was to be received over five quarters during 2016 and 2017. As there was asubstantive and genuine transfer of risk to NovaQuest, the development funding applicable to program expenses during 2016 was recognized as a reduction o
f Research and development expenses 
as incurred. The reduction to Research and development expenses for 2016 totaled $180.3 million . Research and Development Arrangement with NovaQuest Co-Investment Fund V, L.P.
In April 2016, Pfizer entered into an agreement with NovaQuest under which NovaQuest will fund up to 
$200 million in development costs related to certain Phase III clinical trials of Pfizer’s rivipansel compound and Pfizer will use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for such compound. NovaQuest’s
development funding is expected to cover up to 
100% of the development costs and will be received over approximately twelve quarters from 2016 to 2019. As there is a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to NovaQuest, the development funding is recognized by us
 as an obligation to perform contractual services and therefore is areduction of 
Research and development expenses as incurred. The reduction to Research and development expenses for 2016 totaled $46.6 million . Following potential regulatory approval, NovaQuest will be eligible to receive a combination of fixed milestone payments of up to approximately 
$267 million in total based on achievement of first commercial sale and certain levels of cumulative net sales, as well as royalties on rivipansel net sales over approximately 
eight years. Fixed sales-based milestone payments will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to 
Amortization of intangible assets over the estimated commercial life of the rivipansel product and royalties on net sales will be recorded as 
Cost of sales when incurred. Research and Development Arrangement with RPI Finance Trust
In January 2016, Pfizer entered into an agreement with RPI, a subsidiary of Royalty Pharma, under which RPI
 will fund up to $300 million in development costs related to certain Phase III clinical trials of Pfizer’s Ibrance (palbociclib) product primarily for adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor positive early breast cancer (the Indication). RPI’s
development funding is expected to cover up to 
100% of the costs primarily for the applicable clinical trials through 2021. As there is a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to RPI, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services and therefore is a
 reduction of Research and development expenses as incurred. The reduction to 
Research and development expenses for 2016 totaled $44.9 million . If successful and upon approval of Ibrance in the U.S . or certain major marketsin the EU for the Indication based on the applicable clinical trials, RPI will be eligible to receive a combination of approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to 
$250 million dependent upon results of the clinical trials and royalties on certain Ibrance sales over approximately 
seven years. Fixed milestone payments due upon approval will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to 
Amortization of intangible assets over the estimated commercial life of the Ibrance product and sales-based royalties will be recorded as 
Cost of sales when incurred. Collaborative Arrangements
In the normal course of business, we enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to in-line medicines, as well as medicines in development that require completion of
research and regulatory approval. Collaborative arrangements are contractual agreements with third parties that involve a joint operating activity, typically a research and/or
commercialization effort, where both we and our partner are active participants in the activity and are exposed to the significant risks and rewards of the ac
tivity. Our rights andobligations under our collaborative arrangements vary. For example, we have agreements to co-promote pharmaceutical products discovered by us or other companies, and
we have agreements where we partner to co-develop and/or participate together in commercializing, marketing, promoting, manufacturing and/or distributing a drug product.
The following table provides the amounts and classification of payments (income/(expense)) between us and our collaboration partners:

    (b)
 
Substantially all relates to amounts earned from our partners under co-promotion agreements. The increase in 2016 reflects an increase in alliance revenues from Eliquis and the inclusion of Xtandi revenuesresulting from the acquisition of M
edivation in September 2016, partially offset by the expiration of the Rebif co-promotion collaboration at the end of 2015. The increase in 2015 reflects an increase in alliancerevenues from Eliquis, partially offset 
by Spiriva (as a result of the expiration of the co-promotion collaboration in the U.S. and certain European countries during 2014).(c) 
 Primarily relates to royalties earned by our partners and cost of sales associated with inventory purchased from our partners.(d) 
 Represents net reimbursements to our partners for selling, informational and administrative expenses incurred.(e)
 
Primarily relates to upfront payments and pre-approval milestone payments earned by our partners as well as net reimbursements. The upfront and milestone payments were as follows: $15 million in 2016 , $310million 
in 2015 (primarily  related to our collaboration with OPKO, see below) and $1.2  billion in 2014 (related  to our collaboration with Merck KGaA, see below). 2016 also includes a $120  million reimbursement related to our collaboratio
n with Lilly (see below).(f) 
 In 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , includes royalties earned o n sales of Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada after October 31, 2013. On that date, the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in the U.S.and Canada expired, and we became
 entitled to royalties for a 36 -month period thereafter until October 31, 2016.The amounts disclosed in the above table do not include transactions with third parties other than our collaboration partners, or other costs associated
 with the products underthe collaborative arrangements.
In addition, in connection with our collaborative arrangements, we paid post-approval milestones to collaboration partners of 
$20 million in 2015 and $80 million in 2014 . These payments were recorded in 
Identifiable intangible assets –– Developed technology rights. We did not pay post-approval milestones to collaboration partners in 2016. We also received upfront and milestone payments from our collaboration partners of 
$200 million in 2015, primarily related to our collaboration with Lilly (see below). This amount was recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue and is being recognized into 
Other (income)/deductions––net over a multi-year period. Collaboration with Eli Lilly & Company
In 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Lilly to jointly develop and globally commercialize Pfizer’s tanezumab, which provides that Pfizer and Lilly will equally
share product-development expenses as well as potential revenues and certain product-related costs. Following the decision by the FDA in March 2015 to lift the partial
clinical hold on the tanezumab development program, we received a 
$200 million upfront payment from Lilly in accordance with the collaboration agreement between Pfizer and Lilly, which is recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet and is being recognized into 
Other (income)/deductions––net over a multi-year period beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Pfizer and Lilly resumed the Phase 3 chronic pain program for tanezumab in July 2015. Under the collaboration agreement with Lilly,
we are eligible to receive additional payments from Lilly upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones.
Collaboration with OPKO Health, Inc.
We entered into a collaborative agreement with OPKO, which closed in January 2015, to develop and commercialize OPKO’s long-acting hGH-CTP for the 
treatment of GHD inadults and children, as well as for the treatment of growth failure in children born SGA who fail to show catch-up growth by 
two years of age. In February 2015, we made anupfront payment of 
$295 million to OPKO, which was recorded in Research and development expenses, and OPKO is eligible to receive up to an additional $275 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. OPKO is also eligible to receive royalty payments associated with the commercialization of hGH-CTP for Adult GHD, which is
subject to regulatory approval. Upon the launch of hGH-CTP for Pediatric GHD, which is subject to regulatory approval, the royalties will transition to tiered gross profit sharing
for both hGH-CTP and our product, Genotropin.
Collaboration with Merck KGaA
In November 2014, we entered into a collaborative arrangement with Merck KGaA, to jointly develop and commercialize avelumab, the proposed international non-proprietary
name for the investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody (MSB0010718C), currently in development as a potential treatment for multiple types of cancer. We and Merck KGa
A areexploring the therapeutic potential of this novel anti-PD-L1 antibody as a single agent as well as in various combinations with our and Merck KGaA’s broad portfolio of
approved and investigational oncology therapies. We and Merck KGaA are also combining resources and expertise to advance our anti-PD-1 antibody into Phase 1 trials.
Under the terms of the agreement, in the fourth quarter of 2014,
 we made an upfront payment of $850 million to Merck KGaA and Merck KGaA is eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to approximately 
$2.0 billion . Both companies will jointly fund all development and commercialization costs, and split equally any profits generated from selling any anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 products from this collaboration. Also, as part of the agreement, we gave Merck KGaA certain co-promotion rights for
Xalkori in the U.S. and several other key markets, and co-promotion activities were initiated in key select markets in 2015. In 2014, we recorded 
$1.2 billion of Research anddevelopment expenses 
associated with this collaborative arrangement, composed of the $850 million upfront cash payment as well as an additional amount of $309 million , reflecting the estimated fair value of the co-promotion rights given to Merck KGaA.
E. Equity-Method Investments
Investment in Hisun Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Company Limited
In September 2012, we and Hisun, a leading pharmaceutical company in China, formed a new company, Hisun Pfizer, to develop, manufacture, market and sell
pharmaceutical products, primarily branded generic products, predominately in China. Hisun Pfizer was established with registered capital of 
$250 million , of which our portion was 
$122.5 million . On January 1, 2013, both parties transferred selected employees to Hisun Pfizer and con tributed, among other things, certain rights to commercializedproducts and products in development, intellectual property rights, and facilities, equipment and distribution/customer contracts. Our contributions in 2013 constituted a
business, as defined by U.S. GAAP, and
 included, among other things, the China rights to certain commercialized products and other products not yet commercialized and allassociated intellectual property rights. As a result of the contributions from both parties, Hisun Pfizer holds a broad portfolio of
 branded generics covering cardiovasculardisease, infectious disease, oncology, mental health and other therapeutic areas.

    We also entered into certain transition agreements designed to ensure and facilitate the orderly transfer of the business operations to
 Hisun Pfizer, primarily the Pfizer ProductsTransition Period Agreement and a related supply and promotional services agreement. These agreements provide for a profit margin on the manufacturing services provided
by Pfizer to Hisun Pfizer and govern the supply, promotion and distribution of Pfizer products until Hisun Pfizer is able to provide for its
 own manufacturing and distribution.While intended to be transitional, these agreements may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties 
for several years and, possibly, indefinitely. These agreements arenot material to Pfizer, and none confers upon us any additional ability to influence the operating and/or 
financial policies of Hisun Pfizer. We are accounting for our interest inHisun Pfizer as an equity-method investment, due to the significant influence we have over the operations of
 Hisun Pfizer through our board representation, minority veto rightsand 
49% voting interest. Our investment in Hisun Pfizer is reported in Long-term investments , and our share of Hisun Pfizer’s net income is recorded in Other (income)/deductions––net.
In 2016, we determined that we had other-than-temporary declines in the value of Hisun Pfizer, and, therefore, we recognized a loss o
f $452 million in Other(income)/deductions––net 
(see Note 4 ), consisting of losses recognized in the first, second and fourth quarters of 2016.  In the first and second quarters of 2016, wedetermined that we had other-than-temporary declines in the value of Hisun Pfizer and, therefore, we recognized a loss of 
$81 million and $130 million , respectively. The declines in value resulted from lower expectations as to the future cash flows to be generated by Hisun Pfizer, primarily as a result of an increase in risk due to
 the continuedslowdown in the Chinese economy and changes in the expected timing and number of new product introductions by Hisun Pfizer. In the 
fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized a loss of 
$241 million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in Hisun Pfizer to approximately $270 million at December 31, 2016. We are continuing to evaluate strategic alternatives with Hisun. These strategic alternatives could impact the value of our investment in Hisun Pfizer in future periods.
In the third quarter of 2015, we determined that we had an other-than-temporary decline in the value of Hisun P
fizer, and, therefore, in 2015, we recognized a loss of $463 million 
in Other (income)/deductions––net (see Note 4 ) . The decline in value resulted from lower expectations as to the future cash flows to be generated by Hisun Pfizer, as aresult of lower than expected recent performance, increased competition, a slowdown in the China economy in relation to their products, as well as certain changes in the
regulatory environment.
In valuing our investment in Hisun Pfizer, we used discounted cash flow techniques, reflecting our best estimate of 
the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows, and anominal terminal year growth factor. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net
cash flows, which include the expected impact of competitive, legal, economic and/or regulatory forces on the products; the
 long-term growth rate, which seeks to project thesustainable growth rate over the long-term; and the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash
 flows, including country risk. As ofDecember 31, 2015 
, the carrying value of our investment in Hisun Pfizer was approximately $ 775 million . Investment in ViiV Healthcare Limited (ViiV)
On January 21, 2014, the European Commission approved Tivicay (dolutegravir), a product for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, developed by
 ViiV, a company formed in 2009by Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline plc to focus solely on research, development and commercialization of HIV medicines and an equity-method investee. This approval, in
accordance with the agreement between GlaxoSmithKline plc and Pfizer, triggered a reduction in our equity interest in ViiV from 
12.6% to 11.7% , effective April 1, 2014. As a result, in 2014, we recognized a loss of approximately 
$30 million in Other (income)/deductions––net . We account for our investment in ViiV under the equity method due tothe significant influence that we continue to have through our board representation and minority veto rights.
Investment in Laboratório Teuto Brasileiro S.A. (Teuto)
We have an option to acquire the remaining 
60% of Teuto, a 40% -owned generics company in Brazil, and Teuto’s shareholders have an option to sell their 60% stake in the company to us. Under the terms of our original agreement with Teuto’s other shareholders, 2016 was the final year in which the call and put options could be exercised. We
and the other Teuto shareholders have agreed to extend the period in which the options could be exercised into 2017
. Our investment in Teuto is accounted for under theequity method due to the significant influence we have over the operations of Teuto
 through our board representation, minority veto rights and 40% voting interest. •
In 2016, we determined that we had an other-than-temporary decline in the value of Teuto, and, therefore, in 2016, we recognized a loss of $50 million in Other(income)/deductions––net 
(see Note 4 ) related to our equity-method investment. The decline in value resulted from lower expectations as to the future cash flows to  begenerated by Teuto, primarily due to a slowdown in Brazilian economic conditions, which have been impacted by political risk, higher inflation, and the depreciation of the
Brazilian Real.
•
In 2014, we recorded income of approximately $55 million in Other (income)/deductions––net, resulting from a decline in the estimated loss from the net call/put option recorded in 2013 and an impairment loss of 
$56 million in Other (income)/deductions––net related to our equity method investment. In valuing our investment in Teuto, we used discounted cash flow techniques, reflecting our best estimate o
f the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows, and anominal terminal year growth factor. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net
cash flows, which include the expected impact of competitive, legal, economic and/or regulatory forces on the products; the
 long-term growth rate, which seeks to project thesustainable growth rate over the long-term; and the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash
 flows, including country risk.F. Cost-Method Investment
AM-Pharma B.V.
In April 2015, we acquired a minority equity interest in AM-Pharma, a privately-held Dutch biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of recAP for inflammatory
diseases, and secured an exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity in the company. The option

    becomes exercisable after completion of a Phase II trial of recAP in the treatment
 of Acute Kidney Injury related to sepsis, which is expected in 2017. Under the terms of theagreement, we paid 
$87.5 million for both the exclusive option and the minority equity interest, which was recorded as a cost-method investment in Long-term investments , and we may make additional payments of up to 
$512.5 million upon exercise of the option and potential launch of any product that  may result from this investment.Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity
Initiatives
We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring, integrating and restructuring businesses and in connection with our global cost-reduction/productivity initiatives. For
example:
•
In connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may includeexpenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees,
assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company); and
•
In connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges associated with site closings and other facility rationalization actions,workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.
All of our businesses and functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and R&D, as well as groups such as
 informationtechnology, shared services and corporate operations.
In connection with our acquisition of Hospira, we are focusing our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. For up
 to a three -year period post-acquisition, we expect to incur costs of approximately 
$1 billion (not including costs of $215 million in 2015 associated with the return of acquired IPR&D rights as described in the 
Current-Period Key Activities section below) associated with the integration of Hospira. In early 2014, we announced that we would incur costs in 2014-2016 related to new programs: our new global commercial structure reorganization and additional cost-
reduction/productivity initiatives. We had the following initiatives associated with these programs:
•
The 2014 global commercial structure reorganization, which primarily includes the streamlining of certain functions, the realignment of regional locations and colleagues tothe support the businesses, as well as implementing the necessary system changes to support different reporting requirements. Through December 31, 2016, we incurred
costs of approximately 
$219 million and have completed this initiative. •
Manufacturing plant network rationalization and optimization, where execution timelines are necessarily long. In connection with our plant network strategy and facilityoptimization of manufacturing operations under the 2014-2016 initiatives, we incurred costs of approximately 
$367 million associated with prior acquisition activity and costs of approximately 
$1.1 billion associated with new non-acquisition-related cost-reduction initiatives. •
Other new cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, primarily related to commercial property rationalization and other consolidation and savings opportunities. In connectionwith these cost-reduction activities, during 2014-2016, we incurred costs of approximately 
$1.4 billion . The costs incurred during 2014-2016, of approximately 
$3.1 billion in total for the above-mentioned programs (but not including expected costs associated with the Hospira integration), include restructuring charges, implementation costs and additional depreciation––asset restructuring. Of this amount, about a quarter of the charges were non-
cash.
Current-Period Key Activities
In 
2016 , we incurred approximately $2.1 billion in cost-reduction and acquisition-related costs (excluding transaction costs) primarily in connection with the integration of Hospira and the aforementioned programs.

In 2016 , Employee terminations represent the expected reduc tion of the workforce by approximately 4,900 employees, mainly in manufacturi ng, sales, research and corporate. Employee termination costs aregenerally recorded when the a
ctions are probable and estimable and include accrued severance benefits, pension and postretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination.The restructuring charges in 
2016 , are associated with  the following:•
IH ( $272 million ); EH ( $158 million ); WRD, GPD and Medical (M) (WRD/GPD/M) ( $169 million ); manufacturing operations ( $368 million ); and Corporate ( $189 million ). The restructuring charges in 
2015 , which include a $39 million charge related to a 36% reduction in our labor force i n Venezuela, are associated with the following:•
IH ( $85 million ); EH ( $402 million ); WRD/GPD/M ( $80 million ); manufacturing operations ( $80 million ); and Corporate ( $164 million ), The restructuring charges in 
2014 are associated with the  following:•
IH ( $63 million ); EH ( $57 million ); WRD/GPD/M ( $37 million ); manufacturing operations ( $97 million ); and Corporate ( $65 million ). as well as $149 million of income related to the parti al reversal of prior-period restructuring charges 
not directly associated with the new individual segments, and primarily reflecting a change in estimate with respect to our sales force restructuring plans.In September 2015, in ord
er to eliminate certain redundancies in Pfizer’s biosimilar drug products pipeline created as a result of the acquisition of Hospira, Pfizer opted to return rights to Celltrion that Hospira hadpreviously acquired to pote
ntial biosimilars to Rituxan® (rituximab) and Herceptin® (trastuzumab). As such, upon return of the acquired rights, in 2015, we incurred charges of $215 million , which are comprised of (i) a write-off of the applicable IPR&D 
assets, totaling $170 million , which is included in Asset impairments ; (ii) a write-off of amounts prepaid t o Celltrion in the amount of $25 million , which is included in Asset impairments 
; and (iii) a payment to Celltrion of $20 million , which is included in Exit costs . (b)
 
Transaction costs represent external costs for banking, legal, accounting and other similar services, most of which in 2016 are directly related to our acquisitions of Medivation and Anacor, and the terminatedtransaction with Allergan. Transactio
n costs in 2015 represent external costs directly related to the acquisition of Hospira and the terminated transaction with Allergan and primarily include expenditures for banking,legal, accounting and other 
similar services.(c)
 
I ntegration costs represent external, incremental costs directly related to integrating acquired businesses, and primarily include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes. In 2016,integration costs primarily relate to 
our acquisition of Hospira and the terminated transaction with Allergan. Integration costs in 2015 represent external incremental costs directly related to our acquisition ofHospira.
(d) 
 Additional depreciation––asset restructuring represents the impact of changes in the estimated useful lives of assets involved in restructuring actions.(e) 
 Implementation costs represent external, incremental costs directly related to implementing our non-acquisition-related cost-reduction/productivity initiatives.90

2015 v. 2014 ––Interest income increased primarily due to higher investment returns. Interest expense decreased, primarily due to the repayment of a portion of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2015 and thebenefit of the effective conversi
on of some fixed-rate liabilities to floating-rate liabilities. Capitalized interest expense totaled $ 61 million in 2016 , $ 32 million in 2015 and $ 41 million in 2014 . (b)
 
In 2015, represents a foreign currency loss related to conditions in Venezuela during 2015, that had us resolve that our Venezuelan bolivar-denominated net monetary assets that are subject to revaluation were nolonger expected to be settl
ed at the Venezuelan government CENCOEX official rate of 6.30 , but rather at the then  SIMADI rate of 200 , the lowest official rate. Those conditions included the inability to obtainsignificant conversions of Venez
uelan bolivars related to intercompany U.S. dollar denominated accounts, an evalua tion of the effects of the implementation of a fourth-quarter 2015 operational restructuring,resulting in a 
36% reduction in our labor fo rce in Venezuela, and our expectation of the changes in Venezuela’s responses to changes in its economy.(c)
 
Royalty-related income decreased in 2016, reflecting lower royalty i ncome for Enbrel of $54 million , resulting from the expiration o n October 31, 2016 of the 36 -month royalty period under the collaborationagreement for Enbrel in the U.S. 
and Canada (the collaboration period under the agreement expired on October 31, 2013), and the expiration of other royalty agreements, partially offset by Xtandi royalty-relatedincome of 
$63 million . (d)
 
In 2016 , primarily includes amounts to resolv e a Multi-District Litigation relating to Celebrex and Bextra pending against the Company in New York federal court for $486 million , partially offset by the reversal of a legal accrual where a loss is no l
onger deemed probable. For additional information, see Note 17A5. In addition, 2016 includes a settlement related t o a patent matter. In 2015 , primarily includes $784.6 million related to an agreement i
n principle reached in February 2016 and finalized in April 2016 to resolve claims alleging that Wyeth's practices relating to the calculation of Medicaid rebates for its drug, Protonix(pantoprazole sodium), betw
een 2001 and 2006, several years before Pfizer acquired Wyeth in 2009, violated the Federal Civil False Claims Act and other laws. For additional information, see Note 17A5 . In 2014, primarily include
s approximately $610 million for Neurontin-related matters (incl uding off-label promotion actions and antitrust actions), $400 million to resolve a securities class action a gainst Pfizer in NewYork federal court, and
 approximately $56 million for an Effexor-related matter, parti ally offset by $130 million of income from the reversal of two legal accruals where a loss is no longer deemed probable.(e)

o. For additional information concerning Hisun Pfizer and Teuto, see Note 2E. The intangible asset impairment c
harge for 2016 for the IPR&D compound for the treatment of anemia acquired in connection with our acquisition of Hospira reflects, among other things, the impact of regulatorydelays, including delays resulti
ng from a recent court ruling, requiring a 180-day waiting period after approval before a biosimilar product can be launched. The intangible asset impairment charges for 2016 for thesterile injectable IPR&D compounds 
acquired in connection with our acquisition of InnoPharma reflect, among other things, the impact of portfolio prioritization decisions and decreased commercial profiles ofcertain compounds. The intan

Reflects intangible assets written down to fair value in 2016 . Fair value was determined using t he income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, also known as the discounted cash flowmethod. We started with a forecast of 
all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset and then applied an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significantestimates and assumptions inh
erent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the productand the impact of technolo
gical risk associated with IPR&D assets; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate thegeographic diversity of the pr
ojected cash flows.92

2016 v. 2015 –– The increase in the domestic loss was primarily due to a charge related to the write-down of HIS net assets to fair value less estimated costs to sell, higher asset impairments, and higherrestructuring charges and cert
ain acquisition-related costs, partially offset by the inclusion of a full year of legacy U.S. Hospira operations as compared to four months of U.S. operations in 2015, and lower chargesfor legal matters. The increase in int
ernational income is primarily due to the non-recurrence of a foreign currency loss related to Venezuela partially offset by a charge related to the write-down of HIS net assets tofair value less estimated costs to sell, a
nd higher restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs.(b)
 
2015 v. 2014 –– The increase in the domestic loss was primarily due to the loss of exclusivity for Celebrex and Zyvox, higher restructuring charges and higher selling, informational and administrative expenses,partially offset by the performanc
e of certain products including Prevnar 13 and Ibrance, and the impact of Hospira operations. The decrease in international income was primarily due to a foreign currency lossrelated to Venezuela, hig
her asset impairments, and the loss of exclusivity for Lyrica in certain developed markets, partially offset by lower R&D costs.The following table provides the components of

  $1,123  $1,990  $3,120 In 
2016 , the Provision for taxes on income was impacted by the following: •
U.S. tax expense of approximately $1.1 billion as a result of providing U.S. deferred income taxes on certain funds earned outside the U.S . that will not be indefinitelyreinvested overseas, virtually all of which were earned in the current year (see 
Note 5C ); •
tax benefits of approximately $460 million , representing tax and interest, resulting from the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years, primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations;
•
benefits related to the final resolution of an agreement in principle reached in February 2016 and finalized in April 2016 to resolve certain claims related to Protonix, whichresulted in the receipt of information that raised our initial assessment in 2015 of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax position;
•
net tax benefits of $89 million , related to the adoption of a new accounting standard in the  fourth quarter of 2016, as of January 1, 2016, requiring excess tax benefits ordeficiencies of share-based compensation to be recognized as a component of the

    In 
2014 , the Provision for taxes on income was impacted by the following: •
U.S. tax expense of approximately $2.2 billion as a result of providing U.S. deferred income taxes on certain funds earned outside the U.S . that will not be indefinitelyreinvested overseas, virtually all of which were earned in 2014 (see 
Note 5C ); •

the non-deductibility of a $362 million fee payable to the federal government as a result of the U.S . Healthcare Legislation.In all years, federal, state and international net tax liabilities assumed or established as part of a business acquisition are not included in 
Provision for taxes on income (see Note 2A 
). B. Tax Rate Reconciliation
The reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our ef
fective tax rate for Income from continuing operations  follows:  
  Year Ended December 31,  
  2016  2015  2014 U.S. statutory income tax rate
  35.0  % 35.0  % 35.0  %Taxation of non-U.S. operations 
(a), (b), (c)  (13.8 )  (9.6 ) (7.4 )Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions 
(d)  (5.5 ) (4.0 ) (2.9 )U.S. Healthcare Legislation 
(d)  1.3  0.9  1.0 U.S. R&D tax credit and manufacturing deduction 
(d)  (1.0 ) (1.0 ) (0.9 )Certain legal settlements and charges 
(d)  (2.9 ) 3.1  — All other, net 
(e)  0.3  (2.1 ) 0.5 Effective tax rate for income from continuing operations
  13.4  % 22.2  % 25.5  %(a)
 
For taxation of non-U.S. operations, this rate impact reflects the income tax rates and relative earnings in the locations where we do business outside the U.S., together with the cost of repatriation decisions, aswell as changes in uncertain t
ax positions not included in the reconciling item called “Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions”. Specifically: (i) the jurisdictional location of earnings is a significantcomponent of our effective tax r
ate each year as tax rates outside the U.S. are generally lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate, and the rate impact of this component is influenced by the specific location ofnon-U.S. earnings and the l
evel of such earnings as compared to our total earnings; (ii) the cost of repatriation decisions, and other U.S. tax implications of our foreign operations, is a significant component of oureffective tax rate each year an
d generally offsets some of the reduction to our effective tax rate each year resulting from the jurisdictional location of earnings; and (iii) the impact of changes in uncertain taxpositions not included in th
e reconciling item called “Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions” is a component of our effective tax rate each year that can result in either an increase or decrease to oureffective tax rate. The jurisdictional mix of 
earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings as well as repatriation costs, can vary as a result of the repatriation decisions, as a result of operatingfluctuations in the normal cours
e of business and as a result of the extent and location of other income and expense items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and gains and losses on strategicbusiness decisions. See also 
Note 5A for the components of pre -tax income and Provision for taxes on income, which is based on the lo cation of the taxing authorities, and for information about settlements andother items impacting 
Provision for taxes on income . (b)
 
In all periods presented, the reduction in our effective tax rate resulting from the jurisdictional location of earnings is largely due to generally lower tax rates, as well as manufacturing and other incentivesassociated with our subsidiaries i
n Puerto Rico, Singapore, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic. We benefit from a Puerto Rican incentive grant that expires in 2029. Under the grant, we are partially exemptfrom income, property and munici
pal taxes. In Singapore, we benefit from incentive tax rates effective through 2031 on income from manufacturing and other operations. Hospira’s infusion technologies businessbenefits from income tax exemptio
ns in Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic through 2028 and 2019, respectively.(c)
 
The favorable rate impact in 2016 also includes the non-recurrence of the non-deductibility of a foreign currency loss related to Venezuela. The rate impact in 2015 also includes the non-deductibility of a foreigncurrency loss related to Venezu
ela. The favorable rate impact in 2014 also includes the decline in the non-tax deductible loss recorded in 2013 related to an option to acquire the remaining interest in Teuto, sincewe expected to retain the inv
estment indefinitely. For additional information, see Note 2E. (d)

    C. Deferred Taxes
Deferred taxes arise as a result of basis differentials between financial statement accounting and tax amounts.
The components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, shown before jurisdictional netting, follow:
 
  2016 Deferred Tax   2015 Deferred Tax (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)
  Assets   (Liabilities)   Assets   (Liabilities) Prepaid/deferred items

 (c)     $(30,099 )     $(26,145 ) (a)
 
The amounts in 2016 and 2015 are reduced for unrecognized tax benefits of $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion , respectively, where we have net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, and/or tax creditcarryforwards that are available, 
under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction, to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position.(b)
 
The decrease in 2016 reflects the reversal of certain prior y ear accruals for earnings outside the U.S. that were not indefinitely reinvested overseas, partially offset by additional accruals for certain funds earnedoutside the U.S. in the current ye
ar that will not be indefinitely reinvested overseas. For additional information, see Note 5A. (c)
In 2016 , Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ( $654 million ), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $30.8 billion ). In 2015 , Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent taxassets 
( $732 million ), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $26.8 billion ). We have carryforwards, primarily related to foreign tax credits, net operating and capital losses and charitable contributions, which are available to reduce future U.S. federal
and state, as well as international, income taxes payable with either an indefinite life or expiring at various times from 
2017 to 2036. Certain of our U.S. net operating losses are subject to limitations under IRC Section 382.
Valuation allowances are provided when we believe that our deferred tax assets are not recoverable based on an assessment of estimated future 
taxable income thatincorporates ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax asse
ts.As of 
December 31, 2016 , we have not made a U.S. tax provision on approximately $86.0 billion of unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. As these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, the determination of a hypothetical unrecognized deferred tax liability as of 
December 31, 2016 , is not practicable. D. Tax Contingencies
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, and a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes. All of our tax
positions are subject to audit by the local taxing authorities in each tax jurisdiction. These tax audits can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments and
 theresolution of matters may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have
 beendeemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax bene
fits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variationfrom such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the sta
tutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discreteitems in the period of resolution.
For a description of our accounting policies associated with accounting for income tax contingencies, see 
Note 1O. For a description of the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. 2016 Financial Report

    Uncertain Tax Positions
As tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of our tax
 positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 
, we had approximately $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion , respectively, in net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest. •
Tax assets associated with uncertain tax positions primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment ofincome taxes in another tax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to
 minimizedouble taxation, commonly referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets,
 which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependentupon the actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, 
the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 
, we had approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively, in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. In 2016 , these amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets 
( $1.0 billion ) and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $201 million ). In 2015 , these amounts were included in 
Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ( $963 million ) and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $179 million ). •
Tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions represent unrecognized tax benefits, which arise when the estimated benefit recorded in our financial statementsdiffers from the amounts taken or expected to be taken in a
 tax return because of the uncertainties described above. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily toissues common among multinational corporations. Substantially all of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate.
The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows:

 In 2016 , included in Income taxes payable ( $14 million ), Current tax assets ( $17 million ), Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ( $184 million ), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $2.8 billion 
) and Other taxes payable ( $2.8 billion ). In 2015 , included in Income taxes payable ( $38 million ), Current tax assets ( $22 million ), Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent taxassets 
( $135 million ), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ( $2.7 billion ) and Other taxes payable ( $3.0 billion ). •
Interest related to our unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction and is recorded in Provision for taxes on income in our consolidated statements of income. In 
2016 , we recorded net interest expense of $72 million . In 2015 , we recorded net interest expense of $71 million ; and in 2014 , we recorded net interest expense of 
$40 million . Gross accrued interest totaled $771 million as of December 31, 2016 (reflecting a decrease of approximately $18 million as a result of cash payments) and gross accrued interest totaled 
$714 million as of December 31, 2015 (reflecting a decrease of approximately $5 million as a result of cash payments). In 
2016 , these amounts were included in Income taxes payable ( $4 million ) Current tax asset s ( $13 million ) and Other taxes payable ( $754 million ). In 2015 
, these amounts were included in Current tax asset s ( $12 million ) and Other taxes payable ( $702 million ). Accrued penalties are not significant. See also Note 5A. Status of Tax Audits and Potential Impact
 on Accruals for Uncertain Tax PositionsThe U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS:
•
With respect to Pfizer, the IRS has issued a Revenue Agent’s Report (RAR) for tax years 2009-2010. We are not in agreement with the RAR and are currently appealingcertain disputed issues. Tax years 2011-2013 are currently under audit. Tax years 2014-2016 are open, but not under audit. 
All other tax years are closed.•
With respect to Hospira, the federal income tax audit of tax years 2010-2011 was effectively settled in the second quarter of 2016. The IRS is currently auditing tax years2012-2013 and 2014 through short-year 2015. All other tax years are closed. The tax years under audit for Hospira are not considered material to P
fizer.•
With respect to Anacor and Medivation, the open tax years are not considered material to Pfizer.In addition to the open audit years in the U.S.,
 we have open audit years in other major tax jurisdictions, such as Canada (2010-2016), Japan (2015-2016), Europe (2011-2016,primarily reflecting Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain and Germany), Latin America (1998-2016, primarily reflecting Brazil) and Puerto Rico (2010-2016).

 2016 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    Any settlements or statutes of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. We estimate 
that it is reasonably possible that withinthe next twelve months, our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, could decrease by
 as much as $100 million , as a result of settlements with taxing authorities or the expiration of the statutes of limitations. Our assessments are based on
 estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but ourestimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not
 be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect ourfinancial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes o
f limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing auditswith the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of
 possible changesrelated to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant.

We use a market approach in valuing financial instruments on a recurring basis. For additional information, see Note 1E. All of our financial assets and lia bilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis useLevel 2 inputs in the calculati
on of fair value, except less than 2% that use Level 1 inputs and money market funds measured at net asset value.(b)
 
As of December 31, 2016 , trading funds and secur ities are composed of $236 million of trading equity funds and $89 million of trading debt funds. As of December 31, 2015 , trading funds and secur ities arecomposed of 
$185 million of trading equity funds and $102 million of trading debt funds. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , trading equity funds of $71 million and $85 million , respectively, are held in trust for benefits attribut
able to the former Pharmacia Savings Plus Plan.(c)
 
Gross unrealized gains and losses related to 2016 are not significant. Unrealized losses related to 2015 available-for-sale debt securities are $593 million and unrealized gains are $44 million . The vast majority of investments related to 2015, i
n an unrealized loss position, relate to the foreign exchange impact on foreign currency denominated securities, which are hedged with foreign currency forward-exchange contractsand cross-currency swaps. We have th
e intent and ability to hold such investments to maturity.(d)
 
Designated as hedging instruments, except for certain contracts used as offsets; namely, foreign currency forward-exchange contracts with fair values of $162 million as of December 31, 2016 ; and foreign currency forward-exchange co
ntracts with fair values of $136 million as of December 31, 2015 . (e)
 
The differences between the estimated fair values and carrying values of held-to-maturity debt securities, private equity securities at cost-method and short-term borrowings not measured at fair value on arecurring basis were no
t significant as of December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015 . The fair value measurements of o ur held-to-maturity debt securities and our short-term borrowings are based on Level 2inputs, using a market appro
ach. The fair value measurements of our private equity securities carried at cost are based on Level 3 inputs. Short-term borrowings include foreign currency short-term borrowings withfair values of 
$547 million as of December 31, 2015, which are used as hedging instruments.(f) 
 Our private equity securities represent investments in the life sciences sector.(g)
 
Designated as hedging instruments, except for certain contracts used as offsets; namely, foreign currency swaps with fair values of $269 million and foreign currency for ward-exchange contracts with fair values of$113 million 
as of December 31, 2016 ; and foreign currency swaps with f air values of $234 million and foreign currency for ward-exchange contracts with fair values of $59 million as of December 31, 2015 . (h)
 
We adopted a new standard as of January 1, 2016 that changed the presentation of debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying value of that associated debt,consistent with the presentatio
n of a debt discount. See Note 1B for additional information.

    (i) 
 The fair value of our long-term debt (not including the current portion of long-term debt) was $34.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $32.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 . The fair value mea surements for ourlong-term debt are based on Le
vel 2 inputs, using a market approach.A single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and
 can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For adescription of our general accounting policies associated with developing fair value estimates, see 
Note 1E. For a description of the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities:
•
Trading equity securities—quoted market prices.•
Trading debt securities—observable market interest rates.•
Available-for-sale debt securities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjustedinterest rate yield curves. Receivable-backed, loan-backed, and mortgage-backed securities are valued by third-party models that use significant inputs derived from
observable market data like prepayment rates, default rates, and recovery rates.
•
Money market funds—observable net asset value prices.•
Available-for-sale equity securities—third-party pricing services that principally use a composite of observable prices.•
Derivative financial instruments (assets and liabilities)—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.Where applicable, these models discount future cash flow amounts using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves, and forward and spot prices
for currencies. The credit risk impact to our derivative financial instruments was not significant.
•
Held-to-maturity debt securities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjustedinterest rate yield curves.
•
Private equity securities, excluding equity-method investments—application of the implied volatility associated with an observable biotech index to the carrying amount ofour portfolio.
•
Short-term borrowings and long-term debt—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and ourown credit rating.
We periodically review the methodologies, inputs and outputs of third-party pricing services for reasonableness. Our procedures can include, for example, referencing other
third-party pricing models, monitoring key observable inputs (like LIBOR interest rates) and selectively performing test-comparisons of values with actual sales of financial
instruments.

    In addition, as of 
December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had long-term receivables where the determination of fair value employs discounted future cash flows, using current interest rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. As of 
December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the differences between the estimated fair values and carrying values of these receivables were not significant.
There were no significant impairments of financial assets recognized in any period presented.

Includes receivable-backed, loan-backed, and mortgage-backed securities, all of which are investment-grade and in senior positions in the capital structure of the security. Receivable-backed securities arecollateralized by credit cards receiv
ables, and loan-backed securities are collateralized by senior secured obligations of a diverse pool of companies or student loans. Mortgage-backed securities are collateralizedby diversified pools of residenti
al and commercial mortgages.C. Short-Term Borrowings
Short-term borrowings include amounts for commercial paper of 
$5.8 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 . The weighted-average effective interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding was approximately 
1.3% as of December 31, 2016 and 1.9% as of December 31, 2015 . On June 24, 2016, we acquired Anacor and assumed its short-term debt with an acquisition date fair value of 
$698 million which was redeemed in the second and third quarters of 2016.
As of December 31, 
2016 , we had access to $7.9 billion of lines of credit, of which $790 million expire within one year . Of these lines of credit, $7.8 billion were unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us 
$7.1 billion at our request. Also, $7.0 billion of our unused lines of credit, all of which expire in 2021, may be used to support our commercial paper borrowings.
D. Long-Term Debt
November 2016 Public Debt Offering
On November 21, 2016, we completed a public offering of 
$6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes: $1.0 billion of notes due 2019; $1.0 billion of notes due 2021; 
$1.75 billion of notes due 2026; $1.0 billion of notes due 2036; and $1.25 billion of notes due 2046, with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 3.10% . The notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time at our option, at a redemption price equal to 
the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at the U.S.
 Treasury rate, plus an incremental spread ranging between 0.10% and 0.20% 
, depending on the maturity; plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. We used a portion of the proceeds from the November 2016 public debt offering of 
$6.0 billion to repurchase a total of $3.4 billion carrying value of outstanding debt before the maturity date at a redemption value of 
$3.7 billion . The debt repurchased included $3.27 billion carrying value of 6.20% senior notes due March 2019. As a result, we recorded a total net loss of approximately 
$312 million upon the early redemption of debt, which includes the related termination of interest rate swaps, and which was recorded in Other (income)/deductions––net 
in the consolidated statement of income (see Note 4 ). 100

    June 2016 Public Debt Offering
On June 3, 2016, we completed a public offering of 
$5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 2.09% . The notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time at our option, at a redemption price equal to 
the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at the U.S.
 Treasury rate, plus an incremental spread ranging between 0.05% and 0.15% 
, depending on the maturity; plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. Acquisition of Hospira Debt
On September 3, 2015, the Hospira acquisition date, our long-term debt increased due to the addition o
f an aggregate principal amount of $1,750 million of legacy Hospira debt, recorded at acquisition-date fair value of 
$1,928 million . In October 2015, Pfizer exchanged 
$1.7 billion debt of its then recently acquired subsidiary, Hospira, for virtually the same amount of Pfizer debt with the same interest  rate andmaturity terms as the Hospira debt, leaving a minor amount of outstanding debt in Hospira’s name that was redeemed during the fourth quarter of 2016
. In connection with theexchange offers, the indenture governing the Hospira notes and the Hospira notes were amended to, among other 
things, eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants.The net income effect of this exchange was immaterial.

    E. Derivative Financial Instruments and 
Hedging ActivitiesForeign Exchange Risk
A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in 
foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreignexchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to
same-currency liabilities. Depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt.
These financial instruments serve to protect net income and net investments against the impact of
 the translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominatedtransactions.
As of 
December 31, 2016 , the aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange derivative financial instruments hedging or offsetting foreign currency exposures was $27.5 billion 
. The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. pound, and Japanese yen. The  maximum length of time over which we arehedging future foreign exchange cash flow relates to our 
$1.9 billion U.K. pound debt maturing in 2038. All derivative contracts used to manage foreign currency risk are measured at fair value and are reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in
fair value are reported in earnings or in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) , depending on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument (offset or hedge  relationship) andthe effectiveness of the hedge relationships, as follows:
•
We record in Other comprehensive income/(loss) the effective portion of the gains or losses on foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges and reclassify those amounts, as appropriate, into earnings in the
 same period or periods during which the hedged transactionaffects earnings.
•
We recognize the gains and losses on foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps that are used to offset the same foreign currency assets orliabilities immediately into earnings along with the earnings impact of the items they generally offset. These contracts essentially take the opposite currency position of that
reflected in the month-end balance sheet to counterbalance the effect o
f any currency movement.•
We recognize the gain and loss impact on foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forward-exchange contracts designated as hedges of our net investments inearnings in three ways: over time—for the periodic net swap payments; immediately—to the extent of any change in the
 difference between the foreign exchange spot rateand forward rate; and upon sale or substantial liquidation of our net investments—to the extent
 of change in the foreign exchange spot rates.•
We record in Other comprehensive income/(loss) the foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign exchange-denominated debt designated as a hedge of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and reclassify those amounts into earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of our net investments.
We designate foreign currency forward-exchange contracts as cash flow hedges of a portion of our forecasted euro, Japanese yen
, U.K. pound, Australian dollar, andCanadian dollar-denominated intercompany inventory sales expected to occur no more than two years from the date of each hedge. As of
 December 31, 2016, the notionalamount of outstanding foreign currency forward-exchange contracts hedging our intercompany forecasted sales was 
$3.1 billion , with a pre-tax gain of $222 million deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
Based on year-end foreign exchange rates that are subject to change, we expect  to reclassify a pre-tax gain of $164 million within the next 12 months into 
Cost of sales. Any ineffectiveness is recognized immediately into earnings. There was no significant ineffectiveness for any period presented.
Interest Rate Risk
Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. We strive to invest and borrow primarily on a floating-rate basis; however, in light of current
market conditions, we currently borrow primarily on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. From time to time, depending on market conditions, we will change the profile of our
outstanding debt by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps. We entered into derivative financial instruments to hedge or offset
 the fixed interestrates on the hedged item, matching the amount and timing of the hedged
 item. As of December 31, 2016 , the aggregate notional amount of interest rate derivative financial instruments was 
$16 billion . The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar and euro fixed-rate debt. All derivative contracts used to manage interest rate risk are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in fair
value are reported in earnings, as follows:
•
We recognize the gains and losses on interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings upon the recognition of the change in fair value of thehedged risk. We recognize the offsetting earnings impact of fixed-rate debt attributable to 
the hedged risk also in earnings.Any ineffectiveness is recognized immediately into earnings. There was no significant ineffectiveness for any period presented.

slation adjustments, net.For information about the fair value of our derivative financial instruments, and the impact on our consolidated balance sheets, see 
Note 7A above . Certain of our derivativeinstruments are covered by associated credit-support agreements that have credit-risk-related contingent features designed to reduce our counterparties’ exposure to our risk
of defaulting on amounts owed. As of 
December 31, 2016 , the aggregate fair value of these derivative instruments that are in a net  liability position was $936 million , for which we have posted collateral of 
$958 million in the normal course of business. If there had been a downgrade to below an A rating by  S&P or the equivalent rating by Moody’s, wewould not have been required to post any additional collateral to our counterparties.
F. Credit Risk
On an ongoing basis, we review the creditworthiness of counterparties to our foreign exchange and interest rate agreements and do not
 expect to incur a significant loss fromfailure of any counterparties to perform under the agreements. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk related to our financial instruments with any individual
counterparty, except for certain significant customers. For additional information, see N 
ote 18C . As of December 31, 2016 , we had $1.2 billion due from a well-diversified, highly rated group (S&P ratings of mostly A or better) of bank counterparties around the world. For details about
 our investments, see Note 7B above . In general, there is no requirement for collateral from customers. However, derivative financial instruments are executed under credit-support agreements that provide for the
ability to request collateral payments, depending on levels of exposure, our credit rating and the credit rating of the counterparty.
 As of December 31, 2016 , we received cash collateral of 
$613 million from various counterparties. The collateral primarily supports the approximate fair value of our derivative contracts. With respect to the collateral received, the obligations are reported in 
Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt. 2016 Financial Report

    Our identifiable intangible assets are associated with the following, as a percentage of total identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization:
 
  December 31, 2016

  73 % 27 % — Brands, indefinite-lived
  71 % 29 % — IPR&D
  92 % 5 % 4 %Developed Technology Rights
Developed technology rights represent the amortized cost associated with developed technology, which has been acquired from third parties and which can include the right to
develop, use, market, sell and/or offer for sale the product, compounds and intellectual property that
 we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processesthat have been completed. We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing the commercialized
products included in our biopharmaceutical businesses. The more significant components of developed technology rights are the following (in order of significance): Xtandi,
Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Enbrel and, to a lesser extent
, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, Pristiq, Tygacil, Refacto AF and Effexor. Also included in this categoryare the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain biopharmaceutical products.
Brands
Brands represent the amortized or unamortized cost associated with tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protec
tion. Most of theseassets are associated with our Consumer Healthcare business unit. The more significant components of indefinite-lived brands are the following (in order of significance): Advil,
Xanax/Xanax XR, Centrum, Caltrate, Medrol and Preparation H. The more significant components of finite-lived brands are the following (in order of significance): Nexium,
Depo-Provera, Zavedos and, to a lesser extent, Advil Cold and Sinus and Idoform Bifiform.
IPR&D
IPR&D assets represent R&D assets that have not yet
 received regulatory approval in a major market. The more significant components of IPR&D are the programs for thetreatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis acquired as part of the Anacor acquisition, the treatment of non-mestastatic and
 mestastatic prostate cancer acquired as part ofthe Medivation acquisition and the program for the treatment of patients with germline breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA mutated advanced breast cancer.
IPR&D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated
 R&D effort. Accordingly, during thedevelopment period after the date of acquisition, these assets will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S.
 or the EU, or in a seriesof other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At tha
t time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the asset out ofIPR&D and begin amortization. If the associated R&D effort is abandoned,
 the related IPR&D assets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty 
that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. The nature of the biopharmaceuticalbusiness is high-risk and, as such, we expect that many of these IPR&D asse
ts will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future.Amortization
The weighted-average life for each of our total finite-lived intangible assets and the largest component, developed technology rights, is approximately 
11 years. Totalamortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was 
$4.1 billion in 2016 , $3.8 billion in 2015 and $4.1 billion in 2014 . The following table provides the annual amortization expense expected for the years 2017 through 2021:

 Primarily reflects the impact of foreign exchange and, with respect to EH, the impact of the reclassification of $119 million to Assets held for sale during 2016 (see Note 2B ). We manage our commercial operations through 
two distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH), which was previously known asEstablished Products. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, we reorganized our operating segments to reflect 
that we now manage our innovative pharmaceutical andconsumer healthcare operations as one business segment, IH. From the beginning of our fiscal year 2014 until the second quarter of 2016
, these operations were managed astwo business segments: the GIP segment and the 
VOC segment. We have retrospectively presented goodwill according to the new operating segment structure. For additionalinformation, see 
Note 18. As a result of this change, our goodwill associated with our former GIP segment was required to be reallocated to new reporting units based on relative fair value.
Note 11. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans
The majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have
 both IRC-qualified andsupplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. A qualified plan meets the requirements of certain sections of the IRC, and, generally,
contributions to qualified plans are tax deductible. A qualified plan typically provides benefits to a broad group of employees with restrictions on discriminating in favor of highly
compensated employees with regard to coverage, benefits and contributions. A supplemental (non-qualified) plan provides additional benefits to certain employees. In addition,
we provide medical insurance benefits to certain retirees and their eligible dependents through our postretirement plans. During 2015, we recorded net pension and
postretirement benefit obligations of approximately 
$115 million as a result of the acquisition of Hospira and an additional $122 million for the decision to terminate Hospira’s U.S. qualified pension plan.

 2016 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    (a)
 
2016 v. 2015 –– The decrease in net periodic benefit costs for our U.S. qualified pension plans was primarily driven by (i) a year-over-year decrease in settlement activity compared to that of 2015 related to thenon-recurring lump-sum settleme
nt option to certain plan participants discussed in the 2015 v. 2014 analysis, below, (ii) lower service costs resulting from a higher discount rate, and (iii) lower interest costsresulting from a lower beginni
ng benefit obligation. The aforementioned decreases were partially offset by (i) a lower expected return on plan assets resulting from both a lower expected rate of return, and a netdecrease of approximately 
$1.1 billion in the asset base, due in p art to lump-sum payments made in 2015 to certain terminated vested colleagues to settle Pfizer’s pension obligation, and (ii) an increase in theamounts amortized for actuarial l
osses, primarily resulting from the remeasurement in 2015 of Hospira’s U.S. qualified pension plan due to its plan termination.2015 v. 2014 
–– The increase in net periodic benefit costs for our U.S. qualified pension plans was primarily driven by (i) a non-recurring charge of $419 million related to the settlemen t of pension obligations inaccordance with an offer to cert
ain terminated employees who are vested in their pension benefits to elect a lump-sum payment to settle Pfizer’s pension obligation with those participants, or an annuity of theirdeferred vested pension 
benefits, and (ii) the increase in the amounts amortized for actuarial losses resulting from the decrease, in 2014, in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation (whichincreased the amount of d
eferred actuarial losses), and, to a lesser extent, a 2014 change in mortality assumptions (reflecting a longer life expectancy for plan participants). The aforementioned increases werepartially offset by (i) a greater exp
ected return on plan assets resulting from an increased plan asset base due to a voluntary contribution of $1.0 billion made at the beginning of Januar y 2015, which in turn waspartially offset by a decrease in t
he expected rate of return on plan assets from 8.5% to 8.3% and (ii) lower interest costs resulting fr om the decrease, in 2014, in the discount rate used to determine the benefitobligation.
(b)
 
2016 v. 2015 –– The decrease in net periodic benefit costs for our U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) pension plans was primarily driven by (i) a decrease in the amounts amortized for actuarial losses resultingfrom the increase in 2015 in t
he discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation, (ii) lower settlement activity, and (iii) lower service costs resulting from a higher discount rate.2015 v. 2014 
–– The increase in net periodic benefit costs for our U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) pension plans was primarily driven by (i) an increase in the amounts amortized for actuarial losses resultingfrom the decrease, in 2014, i
n the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation, and (ii) higher settlement activity.(c)
 
2016 v. 2015 –– The decrease in net periodic benefit costs for our international pension plans was primarily driven by (i) lower service and interest costs, resulting from a change in our approach for measuringservice and interest costs (see (f) bel
ow), (ii) lower settlement activity, and (iii) a decrease in the amounts amortized for actuarial losses resulting from large gains in 2015, which decreased the plan net lossposition. The aforementione
d decreases to our net periodic benefit costs were partially offset by a decrease in the expected return on plan assets due to a lower asset base and a lower expected rate of return onplan assets.
2015 v. 2014 
–– The increase in net periodic benefit costs for our international pension plans was primarily driven by (i) a decrease in the expected return on plan assets due to a lower expected rate of return onplan assets, (ii) an increase in th
e amounts amortized for actuarial losses resulting from the decrease, in 2014, in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation, and (iii) higher settlement charges dueto the settlement of a pensio
n plan in Sweden. The aforementioned increase in net periodic benefit costs was partially offset by the decrease in interest cost resulting from the decrease, in 2014, in the discountrate used to determine the
 benefit obligation.(d)
 
2016 v. 2015 –– The increase in net periodic benefit income for our postretirement plans was primarily driven by (i) an increase in prior service credits due to the postretirement medical plan cap changes during2016 and 2015, (ii) lower i
nterest costs resulting from a lower benefit obligation, (iii) lower service costs resulting from a higher discount rate, and (iv) a decrease in the amounts amortized for actuarial lossesresulting from the increase in 2
015 in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation. The aforementioned changes were partially offset by (i) a decrease in expected return on plan assets, primarilyresulting from a decrease in pl
an assets, reflecting payments by the plan for IRC Section 401(h) reimbursements to Pfizer for eligible 2014 and 2015 prescription drug expenses for certain retirees, and (ii) lowercurtailment gains.
2015 v. 2014 
–– The decrease in net periodic benefit costs for our postretirement plans was primarily driven by (i) the increase in the amounts amortized for prior service credits and (ii) an increase in curtailmentgains resulting from the impleme
ntation of changes to certain retiree medical benefits to adopt programs eligible for the Medicare Part D plan subsidy, as allowed under the EGWP, and another plan change toestablish benefit caps for certai
n plan participants, as well as (iii) a decrease in interest cost resulting from the decrease, in 2014, in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation. The aforementioneddecreases were partially offset by 
an increase in actuarial losses resulting from the decrease, in 2014, in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation.(e) 
 For details of the changes in Other comprehensive loss, see the benefit plan activity in t he consolidated statements of comprehensive income.(f) 
 Effective January 1, 2016, the Company changed the approach used to measure service and interest costs for certain international pension and other postretirement benefit plans. For fiscal 2015 and 2014, theCompany measured service an
d interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the respective plan obligations. For fiscal 2016, we elected tomeasure service and interest costs 
by applying the spot rates along the yield curve for certain international plans to the plans' liability cash flows. The Company believes the new approach provides a more precisemeasurement of service and int
erest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. This change does not affect th e measurement of our planobligations. We have account
ed for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, have accounted for it on a prospective basis. The reduction in expense for 2016 associated with this changein estimate was 
$42 million , primarily related to certain intern ational pension plans, which was recognized evenly over each quarter of the year. The change in approach for the postretirement benefit plans wasnot material to the 2016 co
nsolidated statement of income.The following table provides the amounts in

As discussed above, effective January 1, 2016, the Company changed the approach used to measure service cost and interest costs for certain international pension plans and other postretirement benefits. Inaccordance with this change, t
he effective rate for interest on the benefit obligations and effective rate for service cost, respectively, are reported for international pension plans.The assumptions above are used to develop the benefit obligations at fiscal year-end and to develop the
 net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent fiscal year. Therefore, theassumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for each year are established at the end o
f each previous fiscal year, while the assumptions used to determine benefitobligations are established at each fiscal year-end.
The net periodic benefit cost and the benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on at
 least an annual basis. We revise these assumptions basedon an annual evaluation of long-term trends, as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost
 of providing retirement benefits.The weighted-average discount rate for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined annually and evaluated and modified to reflect at year-end the
 prevailing market rate of aportfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better that reflect
 the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For our internationalplans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA/
Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield curveapproach. These rate determinations are made consistent with local requirements. Overall, the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at year-end 
2016 resulted in lower discount rates as compared to the prior year.
The following table provides the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions for our U.S. postretirement benefit plans:

The favorable change in the funded status of our U.S. qualified plans was primarily due to an increase in the actual return on assets, partially offset by plan losses resulting from the decrease in the discount rateat the end of 2016.
(b)
 
Our U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) plans are generally not funded and these obligations, which are substantially greater than the annual cash outlay for these liabilities, will be paid from cash generated fromoperations. The increase in th
e benefit obligation is primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate.(c)
 
The unfavorable change in the international plans’ funded status was primarily due to plan losses related to a decrease in the discount rate (reflecting lower interest rates), partially offset by an increase in theactual return on plan assets.
(d)
 
The favorable change in the funded status of our postretirement plans was primarily due to plan amendments for certain U.S. and Puerto Rico postretirement plans. The U.S. plan change applied a fixed cap oncosts for certain groups within the 
plan. The Puerto Rico plan change includes: (i) a cap on costs for certain groups within the plan, and (ii) the adoption of the EGWP. The changes resulted in reductions to theplan liabilities of 
$82 million for the U.S. postre tirement plan and $95 million for the Puerto Rico po stretirement plan.(e)
 
For the U.S. and international pension plans, the benefit obligation is the PBO. For the postretirement plans, the benefit obligation is the ABO. The ABO for all of our U.S. qualified pension plans was $15.4 billion in 2016 
and $14.8 billion in 2015 . The ABO for our  U.S. supplemental (non-qualified) pension plans was $1.4 billion in 2016 and $1.3 billion in 2015 . The ABO for our international pe nsion plans was $9.3 billion in 2016 
and $8.8 billion in 2015 . 2016 Financial Report

We adopted a new accounting standard as of January 1, 2016 whereby certain investments in 2016 and 2015 that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient havenot been classified as Level 
1, 2 or 3 in the above fair value hierarchy table, but are included in the total. As a result, a reclassification has been made to the prior year's plan asset classification table to conform tothe current year's pre
sentation.A single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and
 can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For adescription of our general accounting policies associated with developing fair value estimates, see 
Note 1E. For a description of the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see 
Note 1C. Equity securities, Fixed income securities and Other investments may each be combined into commingled funds. Most commingled funds are valued to reflect the interest in
the fund based on the reported year-end NAV. Partnership and Other investments
 are valued based on year-end reported NAV (or its equivalent), with adjustments asappropriate for lagged reporting of up to 3 months.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of our pension and postretirement plans’ assets:
•
Cash and cash equivalents: Level 1 investments may include cash, cash equivalents and foreign currency valued using exchange rates. Level 2 investments may includeshort-term investment funds which are commingled funds priced at a stable NAV by the administrator of the funds.
•
Equity securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they aretraded. Level 1 and Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on quoted prices on an exchange or a published
NAV derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. Level 3 investments may include individual securities that are unlisted, delisted,
suspended, or illiquid and are typically valued using their last available price.
•
Fixed income securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which theyare traded. Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on observable prices of the underlying securities. Level 2
investments may include corporate bonds, government and government agency obligations and other fixed income securities valued using bid evaluation pricing models or
quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Level 3 investments may include securities that are valued using alternative pricing sources, such as investment
managers or brokers, which use proprietary pricing models that incorporate unobservable inputs.
•
Other investments: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they aretraded. Level 2 investments may include Insurance contracts which invest in interest bearing cash, U.S. government securities and corporate debt instruments.
Certain investments are authorized to include derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards for managing risks and exposures.

Actual percentage of plan assets in Other investments for 2016 includes $235 million (this amount was $259 million in 2015) related to a gro up fixed annuity insurance contract that was executed by legacy Wyethfor certain members of its defined 
benefit plans prior to Pfizer acquiring the company in 2009, and $144 million (this amount was $129 million in 2015) related to an inve stment in a partnership whose primaryholdings are public equity
 securities. Global plan assets are managed with the objective of generating returns that will enable the plans to meet their future obligations, while seeking to minimize net periodic benefit
costs and cash contributions over the long-term. We utilize long-term asset allocation ranges in the management of our plans’ invested assets. Our long-term return
expectations are developed based on a diversified, global investment strategy that takes into account
 historical experience, as well as the impact of portfolio diversification,active portfolio management, and our view of current and future economic and financial market conditions. As market conditions and other factors change
, we may adjust ourtargets accordingly and our asset allocations may vary from the target allocations.
Our long-term asset allocation ranges reflect our asset class return expectations and tolerance for investment risk within the context of 
the respective plans’ long-term benefitobligations. These ranges are supported by analysis that incorporates historical and expected returns by asset class, as well as volatilities and correlations across asset
classes and our liability profile.
Each pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall investment of the pension plan assets. 
In determining investment policies andassociated target allocations, each committee or board considers a wide variety of factors. As such, the
 target asset allocation for each of our international pension plans is seton a standalone basis by the relevant board or committee. The target asset allocation ranges shown for the
 international pension plans seek to reflect the combined targetallocations across all such plans, while also showing the range within which the target allocations for each plan typically falls.
The investment managers of certain commingled funds and private equity funds may be permitted to use derivative securities as described in each respective investment
management, subscription, partnership or other governing agreement.
E. Cash Flows
It is our practice to fund amounts for our qualified pension plans that are at least
 sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws andlocal tax laws.

For the U.S. qualified plans, the $1.0 billion voluntary contribution, which was c onsidered pre-funding for future anticipated mandatory contributions and is also expected to reduce Pension Benefit GuarantyCorporation variable rate
 premiums, was paid in January 2017.The table reflects the total U.S. and international plan benefits projected to
 be paid from the plans or from our general assets under the current actuarial assumptions used forthe calculation of the benefit obligation and, therefore, actual benefit payments
 may differ from projected benefit payments.F. Defined Contribution Plans
We have defined contribution plans in the U.S. and several other countries. For the majority of the
 U.S. defined contribution plans, employees may contribute a portion of theirsalaries and bonuses to the plans, and we match, in cash, a portion of 
the employee contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2011, for newly hired non-union employees, rehiresand transfers to the U.S. or Puerto Rico, we no longer offer a
 defined benefit pension plan and, instead, offer a Retirement Savings Contribution (RSC) in the definedcontribution plan. The RSC is an annual non-contributory employer contribution (that is, not dependent upon the participant making a contribution) determined based on each
employee’s eligible compensation, age and years of service. Beginning on January 1, 2018, all non-union employees in those U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit plans will
receive the RSC in the defined contribution plans. We recorded charges related to the employer contributions to global defined contribution plans of 
$317 million in 2016 , $287million 
in 2015 and $278 million in 2014 . Note 12. Equity
A. Common Stock
We purchase our common stock through privately negotiated transactions or in open market purchases as circumstances and prices warrant. Purchased shares under each of
the share-purchase plans, which are authorized by our Board of Directors, are available for general corporate purposes. On June 27, 2013, we announced that 
the Board ofDirectors had authorized a 
$10 billion share-purchase plan, which was exhausted in the first quarter of 2015. On October 23, 2014 , we announced that the Board of Directorshad authorized an additional 
$11 billion share-purchase plan (the October 2014 Stock Purchase Plan), and share purchases commenced thereunder in January 2015. In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a new 
$11 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time. On March 8, 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co. to repurchase 
$5 billion of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on March 10, 2016, we paid 
$5 billion to GS&Co. and received an initial delivery of approximately 136 million shares of our common stock from GS&Co. based on a price of 
$29.36 per share, which represented, based on the closing share price of our common stock on the NYSE on March 8,  2016, approximately 80% of the notional amount of the accelerated share repurchase agreement. On June 20, 2016, the
 accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co. was completed, which, per the terms ofthe agreement, resulted in GS&Co. owing us a certain number of shares of Pfizer common stock.
 Pursuant to the agreement’s settlement terms, we received an additional 18 million 
shares of our common stock from GS&Co. on June 20, 2016. The  average price paid for all of the shares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreementwas 
$32.38 per share. The common stock received is included in Treasury stock . This agreement was entered into pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization.
On February 9, 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co. to repurchase shares of
 our common stock. This agreement was entered intounder our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on February 11, 2015,
 we paid $5 billion to GS&Co. and received approximately 
151 million shares of our common stock from GS&Co. On July 2, 2015, the accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co. was completed, which, perthe terms of the agreement, resulted in us owing GS&Co. a certain number of shares o
f Pfizer common stock or its equivalent dollar value. Pursuant to the agreement’ssettlement terms, we elected to settle this amount in cash and paid an additional 
$160 million to GS&Co. on July 13, 2015, resulting in a total o f approximately $5.2 billion paid to GS&Co. The final average price paid for the shares delivered under the accelerated share repurchase agreement was 
$34.13 per share. 114

Represents shares purchased pursuant to and received upon settlement of the accelerated share repurchase agreement entered into on March 8, 2016. See above for additional information.(b)
 
Includes approximately 151 million shares purchased for $5.2 billion pursuant to the accelerated share repurchase  agreement entered into on February 9, 2015 (see above for additionalinformation), as well as other share repurchases 
through year-end 2015.At 
December 31, 2016 , our remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately $11.4 billion . On February 2, 2017, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Citibank to repurchase 
$5 billion of our common stock. This agreement was entered into pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization. For additional information, see 
Note 19. B. Preferred Stock
The Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock is held by an employee stock ownership plan (Preferred ESOP) Trust and provides dividends at the rate of 
6.25% , which are accumulated and paid quarterly. The per-share stated value is 
$40,300 and the preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock as to dividends and liquidation rights. Each share is convertible, at the holder’s option, into 
2,574.87 shares of our common stock with equal voting rights. The conversion option is indexed to our common stock and requires share settlement, and, therefore, is reported at the fair value at the da
te of issuance. We may redeem the preferred stock at any time or upon termination of thePreferred ESOP, at our option, in cash, in shares of
 common stock, or a combination of both at a price of $40,300 per share. C. Employee Stock Ownership Plans
We have 
two employee stock ownership plans (collectively, the ESOPs), the Preferred ESOP and another that holds common stock of the Company (Common ESOP).Allocated shares held by the Common ESOP, including reinvested dividends, are considered outstanding for EPS calculations and the
 eventual conversion of allocatedpreferred shares held by the Preferred ESOP are assumed in the diluted EPS calculation. 
As of December 31, 2016 , the Preferred ESOP held preferred shares convertible into approximately 
1 million shares of our common stock, and the Common ESOP held approximately 55 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016 , all shares of preferred and common stock held by the ESOPs have been allocated 
to the Pfizer U.S. defined contribution plan participants. The compensation cost related to thecommon ESOPs was 
$9 million in 2016 , $8 million in 2015 and $133 million in 2014 . Prior to 2015, Pfizer matching contributions were primarily invested in the Common ESOP. Beginning in January 2015, Pfizer matching contributions are being invested based on the
 investment direction of the employees’ own contributions. As a result, thecompensation cost related to the Common ESOP was significantly lower in 2015 and 2016.
Note 13. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payments. The award value is determined by reference to the fair value of share-based awards to similar employees in
competitive survey data or industry peer groups used for compensation purposes; and is allocated between different long term incentive vehicles, in the form of RSUs,
 PPSs,TSRUs, stock options, PSAs and PTUs, as de
termined by the Compensation Committee.The 2014 Stock Plan (2014 Plan) replaced and superseded the 2004 Plan, as amended and resta
ted. The 2014 Plan provides for 520 million shares to be authorized for grants, plus any shares remaining available for grant under the 2004 Plan as of April 24, 2014 (the carryforward shares). In addition, the 2014 
Plan provides that the number ofstock options, Stock Appreciation Rights (known as TSRUs), RSUs, or other performance-based awards that may be granted to any
 one individual during any 36 -month periodis limited to 
20 million shares, and that RSUs, PPSs and PS As count as three shares, while TSRUs and stock options count as one share, toward the maximum sharesavailable under the 2014 plan. The 2004 Plan provided that the number of stock options,
 TSRUs or other performance-based awards granted to any one individual during any36 
-month period was limited to 8 million shares, and that RSUs, PPSs and PS As counted against the maximum available shares as two shares, while stock options andTSRUs counted as 
one share. As of December 31, 2016 , 391 million shares were available for award. Although not required to do so, we have used authorized and unissued shares and, to
 a lesser extent, treasury stock to satisfy our obligations under these programs.We adopted a new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2016,
 as of January 1, 2016. For additional information, see Note 1B . 2016 Financial Report

B. Restricted Stock Units
RSUs are awarded to select employees and, when vested, entitle the holder to receive a specified number of shares of 
Pfizer common stock, including shares resulting fromdividend equivalents paid on such RSUs. For RSUs granted during the periods presented, in virtually all instances, the units vest after 
three years of continuous service from the grant date.
We measure the value of RSU grants as of the grant date using 
the closing price of Pfizer common stock. The values determined through this fair value methodology generallyare amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses , and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate.

  1.7  1.8  1.8 C. Stock Options
Stock options are awarded to select employees and, when vested, entitle the holder to
 purchase a specified number of shares of Pfizer common stock at a price per shareequal to the closing market price of Pfizer common stock on the date of grant.
Beginning in 2016, only a limited set of overseas employees received stock option grants. No stock options were awarded to senior and other key management in any
 periodpresented; however, stock options were awarded to certain other employees. In virtually all instances, stock options granted since 2005 vest
 after three years of continuous service from the grant date and have a contractual term of 
ten years. In most cases, stock options must be held for at least one year from the grant date before any vestingmay occur. In the event of a sale of business or plant closing or restructuring, options held by
 employees are immediately vested and are exercisable for a period from three months to their remaining term, depending on various conditions.
We measure the value of stock option grants as of the grant
 date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The values determined through this fair valuemethodology generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses , and/or Research and development expenses 
, as appropriate. 116

PPSs are awards granted to select employees which, when vested, entitle the holder to receive, a
t the end of the performance period, a number of shares within a possiblerange of shares of Pfizer common stock, including shares resulting from dividend equivalents paid on such shares. For PPSs granted during the period presented, 
the awardsvest after 
three years of continuous service from the grant date and the number of shares paid, if any , depends on the achievement of predetermined goals related to Pfizer’slong-term product portfolio during a 
five -year performance period from the year of the grant date. The number of shares that may be earned over the performance periodranges from 
0% to 200% of the initial award. We measure the value of PPS grants as of the
 grant date using the intrinsic value method, for which we use the closing price of Pfizer common stock. The values areamortized on a straight-line basis over the probable vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses, 
as appropriate, and adjusted each reporting period, as necessary, to reflect changes in the price of P fizer’s common stock, changes in the number of shares that areprobable of being earned and changes in management’s assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and/or changes in
management’s
assessment of the probable vesting term.

er Return UnitsTSRUs are awarded to senior and other key management, and, beginning in 2016, to certain other employees. TSRUs entitle the holders to
 receive a number of shares of ourcommon stock with a value equal to the difference between the defined settlement price and 
the grant price, plus the dividends accumulated during the five -year or seven - year term, if and to the extent the to
tal value is positive. The settlement price is the average closing price of Pfizer common stock during the 20 trading days ending on the fifthor seventh anniversary of the grant, as applicable; the grant price is the closing price of Pfizer common stock on 
the date of the grant. The TSRUs are automatically settled onthe fifth or seventh anniversary of the grant but vest
 on the third anniversary of the grant, after which time there is no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture.On October 26, 2016, the Compensation Committee approved the modification of current outstanding grants
 of TSRU awards, effective November 1, 2016, to permit a holderwho is "retiree eligible" (at least age 
55 with at least 10 years of service), to elect to exercise and convert his/her TSRUs when vested, into PTUs. The value received upon theelection and conversion is calculated by taking the change in stock price ( 
20 trading day average ending on the exercise date (Election Price) less the grant price) plusaccumulated dividends from the grant date, times the number of TSRUs exercised. This value is divided by the Election Price to de
termine the number of PTUs. The PTUs willbe entitled to earn Dividend Equivalent Units (DEUs), and the PTUs and DEUs will be settled in Pfizer common stock on the TSRUs original settlement date (i.e.
, the fifth orseventh anniversary of grant), and will be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the original grant including forfeiture provisions. This modification applies to approximately
2,900 
employees, including members of senior management. There was no incremental compensation cost resulting from the modification.We measure the value of TSRU grants as of the grant date using a
 Monte Carlo simulation model. The values determined through this fair value methodology generally areamortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses , and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate.

 after three years of continuous service from the grant date. The number of shares paid, if any,  includingshares resulting from dividend equivalents, for awards granted in 
2016 and 2015, depends upon the achievement of predetermined goals related to two measures: (i) operatingincome over 
three one -year periods; and (ii) TSR as compared to the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index (DRG Index) over the three -year performance period. The number of shares paid from awards granted in 2014 depends upon the achievement of predetermined goals related to Pfizer's TSR as compared to an
 industry peer group, for thethree 
-year performance period from the year of the grant date. The number of shares that are earned over the  performance period ranges from 0% to 200% of the initial award.
We measure the value of PSA grants as of the

We lease properties and equipment for use in our operations. In addition to rent, the leases may require us to pay
 directly for taxes, insurance, maintenance and otheroperating expenses or to pay higher rent when operating expenses increase. Rental expense, net of sublease income, was 
$292 million in 2016 , $243 million in 2015 and $216 million 
in 2014 . The future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases follow:

Our insurance coverage reflects market conditions (including cost and availability) existing at the time it is written, and our decision to obtain insurance coverage or to self-
insure varies accordingly. Depending upon the cost and availability of insurance and the nature of the risk involved, the amount of self-insurance may be significant. The cost
and availability of coverage have resulted in self-insuring certain exposures, including product liability. If we incur substantial liabilities that are not covered by insurance or
substantially exceed insurance coverage and that are in excess of existing accruals, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash
 flows or results of operations in theperiod in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued (see 
Note 17 ). 120

    Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see 
Note 5D. A. Legal Proceedings
Our non-tax contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. We are the plaintiff in thevast majority of these actions. An adverse outcome in actions in which we are the plaintiff could result in loss of
 patent protection for a drug, a significant loss of revenuesfrom that drug or impairment of the value of associated assets.
•
Product liability and other product-related litigation, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims,among others, often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual,
provable injury and other matters.
•
Commercial and other matters, which can include merger-related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, can involve complexities that willvary from matter to matter.
•
Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S.and in other countries. 
Certain of these contingencies could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, and/or criminal charges, which could be substantial.
We believe that our claims and defenses in these matters are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do no
t believe that anyof these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding
the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on
 our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/orour cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.
We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and,
 therefore,determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range o
f reasonably possible loss inexcess of amounts accrued. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that
 have been deemed reasonable by management, but the assessment processrelies heavily on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause
 us tochange those estimates and assumptions.
Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on
estimates and assumptions.
The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and
qualitative factors in order to assess materiality, such as, among other things, the amount of
 damages and the nature of any other relief sought in the proceeding, if suchdamages and other relief are specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength o
f our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, ifnot certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; any experience that we or,
 to our knowledge,other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure
might change a reader’s judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; 
the potential impact of the proceeding on ourreputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter.
 In addition, with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financialsignificance of the product protected by the patent. 
As a result of considering qualitative factors in our determination of principal matters, there are some matters discussedbelow with respect to which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.

Like other pharmaceutical companies, we are involved in numerous suits relating to our patents, including but not limited to, those discussed below. Most of the suits
 involveclaims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of 
the generic drugmanufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts 
to enforce, patent rights with respect tocertain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the
 challenges to the U.S. patents on a number of our products that are discussedbelow, patent rights to certain of our products are being challenged in various other countries. We are also party to other pa
tent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuantto which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry. Additionally, our licensing and
collaboration partners face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering several of their products that may impact our licenses or co-promotion rights to such
products. We are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seeks damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate 
for alleged infringement ofits patents by our commercial or other activities. For example, our subsidiary, Hospira, is involved in patent and patent-related disputes over its attempts to bring generic
pharmaceutical and biosimilar products to market. If one of our marketed products is found to infringe valid patent rights of a 
third party, such third party may be awardedsignificant damages, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be
 enhanced as much as three-fold in the event that we or one of oursubsidiaries, like Hospira, is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.

    A2. Legal Proceedings––Product Litigation
Like other pharmaceutical companies, we are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other
products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.
Asbestos
Between 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation, which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety clothing. In
connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other
claims. As of 
December 31, 2016 , approximately 56,200 claims naming American Optical and numerous other defendants were pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.
Numerous lawsuits are pending against Pfizer in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing
asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.
There also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned
by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.
Effexor
•
Personal Injury ActionsA number of individual lawsuits and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against us and/or our subsidiaries in various federal and state courts alleging personal injury as a
result of the purported ingestion of Effexor. Among other types
 of actions, the Effexor personal injury litigation includes actions alleging a variety of birth defects as a result ofthe purported ingestion of Effexor by women during pregnancy. Plaintiffs in these birth-defect actions seek
 compensatory and punitive damages. In August 2013, the federalbirth-defect cases were transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation ( 
In re Effexor ( Venlafaxine Hydrochloride) Products Liability LitigationMDL-2458 
) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Almost all plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their actions. The Multi-District Litigation, as well as the coordinated state court proceedings in California, have been administratively stayed.
•
Antitrust ActionsBeginning in May 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions,
 affiliates of Wyeth andcertain other defendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Ef
fexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a classconsisting of all persons in the U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Ef
fexor XRfrom any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the
 time the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch ofgeneric Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in certain o
f the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws ofcertain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing certain patents for Ef
fexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XRand entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each
 of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in theindividual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor 
XR in the U.S. and itsterritories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S
. District Court for the District of New Jersey.In October 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs’ claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the o
ther directpurchaser plaintiff claims. In January 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct
purchasers and end-payer plaintiffs, which plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Third Circuit. Motions to dismiss remain pending as to the end-payerplaintiffs’ remaining claims.
Zoloft
A number of individual lawsuits and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against us and/or our subsidiaries in various federal and state courts alleging personal injury as a
result of the purported ingestion of Zoloft. Among other types o
f actions, the Zoloft personal injury litigation includes actions alleging a variety of birth defects as a result of thepurported ingestion of Zoloft by women during pregnancy. Plaintiffs in these birth-defect actions seek compensatory and punitive damages and 
the disgorgement of profitsresulting from the sale of Zoloft. In April 2012, the federal birth-defect cases were transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation ( 
In re Zoloft Products Liability Litigation MDL-2342 
) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. A number of  plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their actions.

most of the actions, Ranbaxy, Inc. (Ranbaxy) and certain affiliates of Ranbaxy.
 The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewideclasses consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic
Lipitor) from any of the defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of the de
fendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in thelaunch of generic Lipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/or state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant
to which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor, and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates, and (ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of certain patents
 forLipitor. Each of the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages on behalf
 of the putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions,generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition, individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that
 assert claimsand seek relief for the plaintiffs that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class ac
tions described above. These various actionshave been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation ( 
In re Lipitor Antitrust Litigation MDL-2332 ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims by direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court dismissed with
prejudice the claims of all other Multi-District Litigation plaintiffs. All plaintiffs have appealed the District Court’s orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and 
for leave to amend theircomplaint to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
Also, in January 2013, the State of West
 Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief onbehalf of the State of West 
Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions describedabove.
•
Personal Injury ActionsA number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against us in various federal and state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed type 2 diabetes
 as a resultof the purported ingestion of Lipitor. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.
In February 2014, the federal actions were transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation ( 
In re Lipitor (Atorvastatin Calcium) Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation (No. II) MDL-2502 
) in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. In 2016, certain cases  in the Multi-District Litigationwere remanded to federal courts in California and certain state courts.  In January 2017, the District Court granted our motion for summary judgment, dismissing substantially
all of the remaining cases pending in the Multi-District Litigation. In January 2017, the plaintiffs appealed the District Court's decision to the U.S.
 Court of Appeals for the FourthCircuit.
Viagra
A number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against us in various federal and state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed melanoma and/or the
exacerbation of melanoma as a result of the purported ingestion of Viagra. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.
In April 2016, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation ( 
In Re: Viagra (Sildenafil Citrate) Products Liability Litigation, MDL-2691 
) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Chantix/Champix
Beginning in December 2008, purported class actions were filed against us in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Toronto Region), the Superior Court of Quebec (District of
Montreal), the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta, Judicial District of Calgary, and the Superior Court of British Columbia (Vancouver Registry) on behalf of all individuals and
third-party payers in Canada who have purchased and ingested Champix or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Champix. Each of these actions asserts claims under
Canadian product liability law, including with respect to the safety and efficacy of Champix, and, on behalf of 
the putative class, seeks monetary relief, including punitivedamages. In June 2012, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice certified the 
Ontario proceeding as a class action, defining the class as consisting of the following: (i) all personsin Canada who ingested Champix during the period from April 2, 2007 to May 31, 2010 and who experienced at least one of a number of
 specified neuropsychiatric adverseevents; (ii) all persons who are entitled to assert claims in respect of Champix pursuant to Canadian legislation as the result of their relationship with a class member; and (iii)
all health insurers who are entitled to assert claims in respect of Champix pursuant to Canadian legislation. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice certified the class against
Pfizer Canada Inc. only and ruled that the action against Pfizer should be s
tayed until after the trial of the issues that are common to the class members. The actions inQuebec, Alberta and British Columbia have been stayed in favor of the Ontario action,
 which is proceeding on a national basis.Celebrex
Beginning in July 2014, purported class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Pfizer and certain subsidiaries of P
fizer relating toCelebrex. The plaintiffs seek to represent U.S. nationwide or multi-state classes consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased from the defendants,
 or indirectlypurchased or reimbursed patients for some or all of the purchase price of, Celebrex or generic Celebrex from May 31, 2014 until the cessation of the defendants’ allegedly
unlawful conduct. The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of generic Celebrex in violation of federal antitrust laws or certain state antitrust, consumer protection and various
other laws as a result of Pfizer fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing a patent on Celebrex, engaging in sham litigation and prolonging the impact of sham litigation
through settlement activity that further delayed generic entry. Each of 
the actions seeks treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges forCelebrex since May 31, 2014. In December 2014, the District Court granted the parties’ joint motions to consolidate the direct purchaser and end-payer cases, and all such
cases were consolidated as of March 2015. In October 2014 and March 2015, we filed motions to dismiss the direct purchasers’ and end-payers’ amended complaints,
respectively. In November 2015, the District Court denied in part and granted in part our motion to dismiss the direct purchasers’ amended complaint. In February 2016, the
District Court denied in part and granted in part our motion to dismiss the end-payers’ amended complaint, and in August 2016, the District Court dismissed substantially all of
the end-payer’s remaining claims.

    the time the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct ceases. Plaintiffs allege that the de
fendants’ conduct restricts output and artificially fixes, raises, maintains and/or stabilizesthe prices of intravenous saline solution sold throughout the U.S. in violation of federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs
 seek treble damages (for themselves and on behalf of theputative classes) and an injunction against defendants for alleged price overcharges for intravenous saline solution in the U.S. since January 1, 2013.

) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. A3. Legal Proceedings––Commercial and O
ther MattersAverage Wholesale Price Litigation
Pfizer, certain of its subsidiaries and other pharmaceutical manufacturers were sued in various state courts by a number of states alleging that the
 defendants providedaverage wholesale price (AWP) information for certain of their products that was higher than the actual average prices at which those products were sold. The AW
P is used todetermine reimbursement levels under Medicare Part B and Medicaid and in many private-sector insurance policies and medical plans. All but 
one of those actions have beenresolved through settlement, dismissal or final judgment. The plaintiff state, Illinois, 
in the one remaining action claims that the alleged spread between the AWPs at whichpurchasers were reimbursed and the actual sale prices was promoted by the defendants as an incentive to purchase certain of their products. The ac
tion alleges, among other things, fraud 
and violation of the state’s unfair trade practices and consumer protection statutes and seeks monetary and other relief, including civil penalties and treble damages.
Monsanto-Related Matters
In 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and
spun off the shares of Solutia. In 2000,
 Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then transferred its agricultural operationsto a newly created subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by
Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
In connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to
 indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacia’s formeragricultural business. New Monsanto is defending and indemnifying Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural
business.
In connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses. As the result of
its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia’s indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses are limited to sites
that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spinoff
 that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for,any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutia’s and New Monsanto’s
assumption of, and agreement to, indemnify Pharmacia for these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to
 Former Monsanto’s chemical businessesin which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls.
Solutia and New Monsanto are defending and indemnifying Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsanto’s chemical
businesses.
Environmental Matters
In 2009, we submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) a corrective measures study report with regard to Pharmacia’s discontinued industrial chemicalfacility in North Haven, Connecticut and a revised site-wide feasibility study with regard to Wyeth Holdings Corporation’s discontinued industrial chemical facility in Bound
Brook, New Jersey. In September 2010, our corrective measures study report with regard to the North Haven facility was approved by the 
EPA, and we commencedconstruction of the site remedy in late 2011 under an Updated Administrative Order on Consent with the E
PA. In July 2011, Wyeth Holdings Corporation finalized anAdministrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for Removal Action (the 2011 Administrative Settlement Agreement) with the 
EPA with regard to the Bound Brookfacility. In May 2012, we completed construction of an interim remedy to address the discharge of impacted groundwater from that 
facility to the Raritan River. In September2012, the EPA issued a final remediation plan for the Bound Brook 
facility’s main plant area, which is generally in accordance with one of the remedies evaluated in our revisedsite-wide feasibility study. In March 2013, Wyeth Holdings Corporation (now Wyeth Holdings LLC) entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent
with the EPA to allow us

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    to undertake detailed engineering design of the remedy for the main plant area and to perform a focused feasibility study 
for two adjacent lagoons. In September 2015, theU.S., on behalf of the EPA
, lodged a complaint and consent decree with the federal District Court for the District of New Jersey that will allow Wyeth Holdings LLC to completethe design and to implement the remedy for the main plant area. In December 2015, the consent
 decree (which supersedes the 2011 Administrative Settlement Agreement)was entered by the District Court. We have accrued for the estimated costs of
 the site remedy for the North Haven facility and the site remediation for the Bound Brook facility.We are a party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as
 amended, and otherstate, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.
A4. Legal Proceedings––Government Investigations
Like other pharmaceutical companies, we are subject to investigations and extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple
emerging markets in which we operate. As a result, we have interactions with government agencies on an ongoing basis. Criminal charges, and substantial fines and/or civil
penalties, as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from government investigations. Among the investigations by
government agencies are the matters discussed below.
Phenytoin Sodium Capsules
In 2012, Pfizer sold the U.K. Marketing Authorisation for phenytoin sodium capsules to a
 third party, but retained the right to supply the finished product to that third party. InMay 2013, the U.K. Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) informed us that it had launched an
 investigation into the supply of phenytoin sodium capsules in the U.K. market.In August 2015, the CMA issued a Statement
 of Objections alleging that Pfizer and Pfizer Limited, a U.K. subsidiary, engaged in conduct that violates U.K. and EU antitrustlaws. In December 2016, the CMA imposed a 
£ 84 million fine on Pfizer and Pfizer Limited. Pfizer appealed the CMA Decision to The Competition Appeal Tribunal in February 2017 
. Civil Investigative Demand relating to Pharmacy Benefit Managers
In March 2016, Pfizer received a Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for 
the Southern District of New York related to Pfizer’s contractual relationshipswith pharmacy benefit managers with respect to certain pharmaceutical products over the period from January 1, 2006 to the present. We have
 been providing information tothe government in response to this Civil Investigative Demand.
Subpoenas relating to Copayment Assistance Organizations
In December 2015 and July 2016, Pfizer received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney’s O
ffice for the District of Massachusetts requesting documents related to the PatientAccess Network Foundation and other 501(c)(3)  organizations that provide  financial assistance to Medicare patients. We have been providing information to the government
in response to these subpoenas.
A5. Legal Proceedings––Matters Resolved 
During 2016During 
2016 , certain matters, including the matters discussed below, were resolved or were the subject of definitive settlement agreements or settlement agreements-in- principle.
Sutent (sunitinib malate)
In May 2010, Mylan Pharmaceuticals notified us that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application with the FDA seeking approval to market a
 generic version of Sutent andchallenging on various grounds the Sutent composition-of-matter patent, which expires in 2021, and two other patents tha
t expire in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In June 2010,we filed suit against Mylan Pharmaceuticals in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting the infringement of those 
three patents. The patent expiring in 2020 was dismissed from the case prior to trial. In October 2014, the court held that 
the two patents expiring in 2021 were valid and infringed. In October 2014, MylanPharmaceuticals appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In January 2016
, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed theDistrict Court’s decision upholding the validity and infringement of the 
two patents expiring in 2021.Protonix
In 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil complaint in intervention in 
two qui tam actions that had been filed under seal in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint alleged that Wyeth’s practices relating to the pricing for Protonix for Medicaid rebate purposes between 2001 and
 2006, prior to Wyeth’sacquisition by Pfizer, violated the Federal Civil False Claims Act and federal common law. The 
two qui tam actions have been unsealed, and the complaints included substantially similar allegations. In addition, in 2009, several states and the District of Columbia filed a complaint under the same docket number in the U.S. District Court for
the District of Massachusetts asserting violations of various state laws based on allegations substantially similar to those set forth in the
 civil complaint filed by the DOJ. OnFebruary 12, 2016, Wyeth and the DOJ reached an agreement in principle to resolve the actions pending in the U.
S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts for $784.6 million 
, which was recorded in Other (income)/deductions––net for the year ended December 31, 2015 and paid on April 29, 2016. In April 2016, the agreement was finalized. The final agreement does not include an admission of liability by Wyeth. In August 2016, the
 Court entered an Order of Dismissal.Effexor XR (venlafaxine HCl)
In 2006, Wyeth and Wyeth Canada Limited (the Wyeth companies) filed an action in the Federal Court in Canada against Ratiopharm Inc.
 (Ratiopharm) seeking to preventRatiopharm from obtaining approval in Canada for its generic version of Effexor XR prior to the expiration of 
one of the Wyeth companies’ patents. As a result of that action,Ratiopharm was enjoined from obtaining regulatory approval for its generic product. However, in August 2007, the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada ruled that the patent at
issue could not be asserted against Ratiopharm under the applicable Canadian regulations governing approvals, and it dismissed the Wyeth companies’ action.
Following the dismissal, in 2007, Ratiopharm filed an action in the Federal Court in Canada seeking damages from the Wyeth companies for preventing Ratiopharm from
marketing its generic version of Effexor XR in Canada from January 2006 through August 2007. The Federal Court dismissed Ratiopharm’s action in 2011, but the Federal
Court of Appeal reinstated it in 2012. In 2011 and 2012, 
Pfizer made payments to Teva Canada Limited, which had acquired Ratiopharm, totaling Canadian dollars 52.5 million in partial settlement of this action.
2016 Financial Report

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    The trial in this action was held in January 2014, and the Federal Court issued various findings in March 2014. On June 30, 2014, 
the Federal Court issued a judgment basedon those findings, awarding Teva Canada Limited damages of approximately Canadian dollars 
125 million , consisting of compensatory damages, pre-judgment interest and legal costs. This judgment was satisfied by Pfizer Canada Inc., as successor to the
 Wyeth companies, in July 2014. In September 2014, Pfizer Canada Inc. appealed thejudgment and, in May 2016, the Federal Court of Appeal vacated the lower court’s decision and remanded the case to
 the lower court for further proceedings. The lower courtwill determine whether to affirm, decrease or raise this amount. Ratiopharm has sought leave from the Canada Supreme Court to review the decision of the Court of Appeal.
Lipitor Whistleblower Action
In 2004, a former employee filed a “whistleblower” action against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The complaint remained under seal until
September 2007, at which time the U.S. Attorney for 
the Eastern District of New York declined to intervene in the case. We were served with the complaint in December 2007.Plaintiff alleges off-label promotion of Lipitor in violation of the Federal Civil False Claims Act and the false claims acts of certain states, and plaintiff seeks 
treble damages andcivil penalties on behalf of the federal government and the specified states as the result o
f their purchase, or reimbursement of patients for the purchase, of Lipitor allegedly forsuch off-label uses. Plaintiff also seeks compensation as a whistleblower under those federal and state statutes
. In addition, plaintiff alleges that he was wrongfully terminated,in violation of the anti-retaliation provisions of applicable federal and New York law, and plaintiff seeks damages and the reinstatement of his employment. In 2009, 
the DistrictCourt dismissed without prejudice the off-label promotion claims and, in 2010, plaintiff filed an amended complaint containing off-label promotion allegations that are
substantially similar to the allegations in the original complaint. In November 2012, the District Court dismissed the amended complaint. In December 2012, plaintiff appealed
the District Court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Second Circuit. In August 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed the appeal for lackof jurisdiction and sent the case back to the District Court for clarification of its ruling regarding the plaintiff's employment claims. In November 2014, the District Court granted
plaintiff’s motion for a partial final judgment certifying the dismissal of the false claims counts, and plaintiff appealed the order dismissing those claims to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit. In May 2016, the U.S.
 Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of the false claims counts, and itsubsequently denied a petition for panel rehearing. The plaintiff’s time to file a petition for certiorari requesting a review by the U.S. Supreme Court expired in January 2017. In
November 2016, the District Court administratively closed plaintiff’s employment law claims, subject to Plaintiff requesting to reopen them by January 2017. In December 2016,
plaintiff’s request to reopen the case to consider his employment law claims was granted. We expect to resolve plaintiff’s employment claims on terms not material to Pfizer. 
Celebrex and Bextra
Beginning in late 2004, several purported class actions were filed in federal and state courts alleging that Pfizer and certain of our current and 
former officers violated federalsecurities laws by misrepresenting the safety of Celebrex and Bextra. In June 2005, the federal actions were transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District
Litigation ( 
In re Pfizer Inc. Securities, Derivative and “ERISA” Litigation MDL-1688 ) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In March 2012,  the court inthe Multi-District Litigation certified a class consisting of all persons who purchased or acquired Pfizer stock between October 31, 2000 and October 19, 2005
. In May 2014, thecourt in the Multi-District Litigation granted Pfizer’s motion to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs’ loss causation and damages expert. We
 subsequently filed a motion forsummary judgment seeking dismissal of the litigation, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to submit an amended report by their expert. In July 2014
, the court denied theplaintiffs’ motion for leave to submit an amended report and granted our motion for summary judgment, dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims in their entirety. In August 2014, the
plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Second Circuit. In April 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed theDistrict Court’s decision and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. In July 2016, the parties reached an agreement in principle to resolve this matter
for all defendants for  
$486 million , which was recorded in Other (income)/deductions––net for the year ended December 31, 2016, and was paid in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement. In December 2016, the District Court approved the set
tlement agreement.B. Guarantees and Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses,
 we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise inconnection with the transaction or related to activities prior to the transaction. These indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related
matters and patent-infringement claims. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of 
the indemnification, we would be required toreimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not
paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of 
December 31, 2016 , recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications were not significant. Pfizer Inc. has also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that it acquired and 
that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer.C. Purchase Commitments
As of 
December 31, 2016 , we had agreements totaling $4.7 billion to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and include amounts relating to advertising, information technology services, employee benefit administration services, and potential milestone payments deemed reasonably likely to occur.
Note 18. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information
A. Segment Information
We manage our commercial operations through 
two distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH), which was previously known asEstablished Products. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, we reorganized our operating segments to reflect 
that we now manage our innovative pharmaceutical andconsumer healthcare operations as one business segment, IH. From the
128
 
 2016 Financial Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
 
    beginning of our fiscal year 2014 until the second quarter of 2016, these operations were managed as two business segments:
 the GIP segment and the VOC segment. Wehave revised prior-period information (Revenues and Earnings, as defined by management) to reflect the reorganization. The IH and EH operating segments are each led by a
single manager. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional
indications for in-line products that generally have achieved proof-of-concept. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets.
We regularly review our segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources.
Operating Segments
Some additional information about our business segments follows:
IH Segment
  EH Segment IH focuses on developing and commercializing novel, value-creating medicines and
vaccines that significantly improve patients’ lives, as well as products for consumer
healthcare.
Key therapeutic areas include internal medicine, vaccines, oncology, inflammation &
immunology, rare diseases and consumer healthcare.
  EH includes legacy brands that have lost or will soon lose market exclusivity in bothdeveloped and emerging markets, branded generics, generic sterile injectable
products, biosimilars and, through February 2, 2017, infusion systems. EH also
includes an R&D organization, as well as our contract manufacturing business.
Leading brands include:
- 
Prevnar 13- 
Xeljanz- 
Eliquis- 
Lyrica  (U.S., Japan and certain other markets) - 
Enbrel (outside the U.S. and Canada) - 
Viagra  (U.S. and Canada) - 
Ibrance- 
Xtandi- Several OTC consumer products (e.g., 
Advil  and  Centrum )   Leading brands include:- 
Lipitor- Premarin 
family - Norvasc
- Lyrica 
(Europe, Russia, Turkey, Israel and Central Asia countries) - 
Celebrex- Pristiq
- 
Several sterile injectable productsThe following change in 2016 impacted IH:
•
In connection with the formation in early 2016 of the GPD organization, a new unified center for late-stage development for our innovative products, which is generallyresponsible for the clinical development of assets that are in clinical trials for our WRD and Innovative portfolios, effective in the second quarter of 2016
, certaindevelopment-related functions transferred from IH to GPD.
The following changes in 2016 impacted EH:
•
Beginning in 2016, our contract manufacturing business, Pfizer CentreOne, is part of EH. Pfizer CentreOne consists of (i) the revenues and expenses of legacy Pfizer'scontract manufacturing and active pharmaceutical ingredient sales operation (previously known as Pfizer CentreSource or PCS), including the revenues and expenses
related to our manufacturing and supply agreements with Zoetis, which prior to 2016 was managed outside EH as part of PG
S and previously reported in “OtherUnallocated” costs; and (ii) the revenues and expenses of legacy Hospira's One-2-One sterile injectables contract manufacturing operation, which has been included in EH
since we acquired Hospira on September 3, 2015.
•
In connection with the formation of a new EH R&D organization effective in the first quarter of 2016, certain functions transferred from Pfizer’s WRD organization to the newEH R&D organization. The new R&D organization within EH expects to develop potential new sterile injectable drugs and therapeutic solutions, as well as biosimilars.
Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the 
two operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation.Other Costs and Business Activities
Certain costs are not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with the
 following:•
WRD, which is generally responsible for research projects for our IH business until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the IH segmentvia the newly formed GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual
property rights. The WRD organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide technical expertise and
other services to the various R&D projects, including EH R&D projects. WRD is also responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory
agencies, including all safety-event activities.
•
GPD, which is generally responsible for the clinical development of assets that are in clinical trials for our WRD and Innovative portfolios. GPD also provides technicalsupport and other services to Pfizer R&D projects. In connection with the formation of 
the GPD organization, effective in the second quarter of 2016, certain development-related functions transferred from WRD and IH to GPD. We have reclassified approximately 
$78 million of costs in the first quarter of 2016, $341 million of costs in 2015, and 
$343 million of costs in 2014 from WRD to GPD as well as $76 million of costs in the first quarter of 2016, $318 million of costs in 2015 and $271 million of costs in 2014 from IH to GPD to conform to the presentation as
 part of GPD in 2016.•
Pfizer Medical, which is responsible for the provision of medical information to healthcare providers, patients and other parties, transparency and disclosure activities,clinical trial results publication, grants for healthcare quality improvement and medical education, and partnerships with global public health and medical associations. In
2015 and 2014, Medical was also responsible for regulatory inspection readiness reviews, internal audits of Pfizer-sponsored clinical trials and internal regulatory
compliance processes, which are now part of the compliance function within Corporate.

    •
Corporate, representing platform functions (such as worldwide technology, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs,compliance and worldwide procurement) and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments.
•
Other unallocated costs, representing overhead expenses associated with our manufacturing and commercial operations that are not directly assessed to an operatingsegment as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs (which include manufacturing variances associated with production). The increase in 
Cost of sales 
in 2016 reflects, among other items, the change in manufacturing variances driven by demand decreases versus plan for certain legacy Hospira and legacy Pfizer products.
•
Certain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments toinventory, intangible assets and PP&E; (ii) acquisition-related costs, where we incur costs for executing the transaction, integrating the
 acquired operations andrestructuring the combined company; and (iii) certain significant items, which are substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items that are evaluated on an
individual basis by management and which include non-acquisition-related restructuring costs, as well as costs incurred for legal settlements, asset impairments and
disposals of assets or businesses, including, as applicable, any associated transition activities.
Segment Assets
We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as
 many of our operating assets are shared (such as our plant network assets) or commingled(such as accounts receivable, as many of our customers are served by multiple operating segments). Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review
any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total asse
ts were approximately $172 billion as of December 31, 2016 
and approximately $167 billion as of December 31, 2015 . Selected Income Statement Information

$31.73 per share, which represented, based on the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on February 2,  2017, approximately 80% of the notional amount of the accelerated share repurchase agreement. As of February 6, 2017, the common stock received is included in 
Treasury Stock . At settlement of the agreement, which is expected to occur during or prior to the third quarter of 2017, Citibank may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to us, or,
 under certain circumstances, wemay be required to deliver shares of our common stock or may elect to make a cash payment to Citibank, with the number of shares 
to be delivered or the amount of suchpayment, as well as the final average price per share, based on the difference between the volume-weighted average price, less a discount, of
 Pfizer’s common stock duringthe term of the transaction. This agreement was entered into pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization. A
