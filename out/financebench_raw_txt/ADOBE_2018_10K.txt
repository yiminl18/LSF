PART I
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Founded in 1982, Adobe Inc. (formerly Adobe Systems Incorporated) is one of the largest and most diversified software 
companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, 
students, application developers, enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging 
and transacting with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market our products 
and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users 
through app stores and our own website at www .adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) 
model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription 
and pay-per -use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers 
(“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original 
equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and 
service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on personal and server -based computers, as well as on 
smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and 
Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia-Pacific (“AP AC”). 
 Adobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997. Our 
executive offices and principal facilities are located at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704. Our telephone number

BUSINESS OVER VIEW
 
 For over 35 years, Adobe’ s innovations have transformed how individuals, teams, businesses and governments interact. 
We help our customers create and deliver the most compelling experiences in a streamlined workflow and optimize those 
experiences for greater return on investment. Our solutions turn ordinary interactions into valuable digital experiences, across 
media and devices, anytime, anywhere.
 While we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products, services, and solutions, we focus our investments in two strategic 
growth areas:
 Digital Media—providing products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish 
and promote their content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, web designers, app developers, enthusiasts, and 
digital media professionals, as well as management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our 
customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate on and distribute documents. This is the core of what we have 
delivered for over 25 years, and we have evolved our business model to provide our customers with a range of flexible solutions 
that allow them to reach their full creative potential anytime, anywhere, on any device on projects of all types. 
 Digital Experience—providing enterprises and brands a comprehensive and integrated suite of products, services and 
solutions for creating, managing, executing, measuring and optimizing customer experiences that span from advertising to 
Table of Contents
4commerce. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, merchandisers, merchants, web analysts, data 
scientists, developers, marketing executives, information management executives, product development executives, and sales and 
support executives.  Our robust Adobe Experience Platform provides enterprises and brands a profile that enables deep customer 
insights and personalized digital experiences delivered with our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions. By combining the creativity 
of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience offerings, we help our customers more efficiently and 
effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across channels and devices with an end-to-end workflow and 
feedback loop.
 We believe we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both the Digital Media and Digital Experience markets, where our 
mission is to change the world through digital experiences. By integrating products from each of these areas, our customers are 
able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other company currently offers. In addition, our ability to 
deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, management, delivery , 
measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue investing in engaging 
their constituents digitally .
SEGMENTS
 Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing. These segments 
provide Adobe’ s senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around 
our two strategic growth opportunities described above, placing our Publishing business in a third segment that contains some of 
our mature products and solutions.
MARKET  OVER VIEW
 This overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2019 and beyond 
for each of our segments. See “Results of Operations” within Part II, Item 7 titled “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further segment information.
Digital Media
Digital Media Opportunity
 Recent technology trends in digital communications continue to provide a significant market opportunity for Adobe in 
digital media. In today’ s world where the velocity of creation and consumption of digital content is ever increasing, customers are 
looking for a way to meet demand with engaging online experiences. Adobe is in a strong position to capitalize on this opportunity 
by driving modernization and innovation that will accelerate the creative process across all platforms and devices, deepen 
engagement with communities, and accelerate long-term revenue growth by focusing on cloud-based offerings, which are licensed 
on a subscription basis.
 The flagship of our Digital Media business is Adobe Creative Cloud—a subscription service that allows members to use 
Adobe’ s creative products integrated with cloud-delivered services across desktop, web and mobile devices.  Creative Cloud 
members can download and access the latest versions of our creative products such as Photoshop, Illustrator , Premiere Pro, 
Lightroom CC, InDesign, Adobe XD and many more creative applications.  To expand our reach and improve the way we serve 
the needs of our customers, we create different combinations of these services, including our launch of a mobile photography 
offering that has brought new customers into our franchise and grown the amount of our photography subscriptions.  In addition, 
members can access built-in templates to jumpstart designs and step-by-step tutorials to sharpen skills and get up to speed quickly . 
Through Creative Cloud, members can access online services to sync, store, and share files across users’  machines, access 
marketplace, social and community-based features within our Adobe Stock and Behance services, and create apps and websites, 
all at affordable subscription pricing for cost-sensitive customers. 
 Adobe continues to redefine the creative process with Adobe Creative Cloud so that our customers can obtain everything 
they need to create, collaborate and be inspired. A core part of our strategy is Adobe Sensei, a proprietary framework and set of 
intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei leverages Adobe’ s 
massive content and data assets, as well as its deep domain expertise in the creative, marketing and document segments, within a 
unified artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning framework to help customers discover hidden opportunities, reduce 
tedious processes, and offer relevant experiences to every customer .
 Adobe Creative Cloud addresses the needs of creative professionals such as artists, designers, developers, students and 
administrators. They rely on our products for publishing, web design and development, video and animation production, mobile 
Table of Contents
5app and gaming development, and document creation and collaboration. End users of our creative products work in businesses 
ranging from large publishers, media companies and global enterprises, to smaller design agencies, and individual freelancers. 
Moreover , our creative products are used to create much of the printed and online information people see, read and interact with 
every day, including video, animation, mobile and advertising content. Knowledge workers, educators, hobbyists and consumers 
also use our products to create and deliver content. We have introduced new products, features and services to address emer ging 
categories of content creation, such as voice-based prototyping, refined content creation tools, 3D, augmented reality , virtual reality 
and user experience design. New projects announced and solutions offered include Project Gemini, a mobile drawing and painting 
application, featuring live brushes that mimic natural media like oil paint and watercolors in amazingly lifelike ways; Adobe 
Premiere Rush, an easy-to-use video editing app that simplifies video creation and sharing on platforms including YouTube and 
Instagram, while delivering professional quality video results for social media marketers, video bloggers and video enthusiasts; 
and Photoshop on iPad to enable a seamless experience across devices, and attract a new, mobile-centric audience.
 Adobe’ s Digital Media segment includes our Adobe Document Cloud business, built around our Acrobat family of products, 
including Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Reader , and a set of integrated, cloud-based document services, including Adobe 
Sign and Adobe Scan.  Tens of millions of knowledge workers worldwide interact with documents daily .  For over 25 years, 
Acrobat has provided for the reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source 
type. Users can collaborate on documents with electronic comments and tailor the security of a file in order to distribute reliable 
Adobe PDF documents that can be viewed, printed or filled out utilizing our free Acrobat Reader on any device. Acrobat provides 
essential electronic document capabilities and services to help knowledge workers accomplish a wide variety of tasks ranging 
from simple publications and forms to mission-critical engineering documentation and architectural plans. With our Acrobat 
product and its innovative cloud services, we have extended the capabilities of our solutions. Users can turn slow, manual signing 
processes into automated experiences and collect signatures with Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign.  In addition, we have mobile apps 
such as Adobe Scan that allows any user to create a PDF with the camera on their phone.
Digital Media Strategy
 Our goal is to be the leading platform for creativity where we offer a range of products and services that allow individuals, 
teams and enterprises, both professionals and enthusiasts, to design and deliver amazing digital content.
 We believe there is significant opportunity for growth across all customer segments and expect Adobe Creative Cloud will 
drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users in North 
America and international markets, especially in emer ging markets where there is an opportunity to target new creative professionals 
and enthusiasts entering the market, and drive conversion of non-genuine Adobe users. Enabling students to create and tell their 
stories is another opportunity where Adobe Spark uniquely positions us to deliver on the needs of educators and students in and 
outside of classrooms.
   We will continue to deepen our relationship with existing users through meeting their needs holistically and delivering 
additional features and value, including data-driven customer engagement, AI and machine learning through Adobe Sensei, and 
new design categories.  As appropriate, we plan to optimize our pricing strategy and move our customers to higher priced and 
better value offerings and continue to employ targeted promotions that attract past customers and potential users to try out and 
ultimately subscribe to Adobe Creative Cloud. To target new customers and better address the needs of our existing customers, 
we will continue to invest in driving innovation to maintain the leadership position that we have established. We offer a marketplace 
for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our 
strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow 
a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably .
 As part of our Adobe Creative Cloud strategy , we utilize a data-driven operating model and our Adobe Experience Cloud 
solutions to drive customer awareness and licensing of our creative products and services through our website and across other 
channels. Adobe.com is increasingly becoming the destination site where we engage individual and small business customers to 
sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. We offer free apps and trials to attract new customers and through a data-
driven model, we optimize conversion of these trialists to paid subscribers. We utilize channel partners to target mid-size creative 
customers with our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest 
customers and driving adoption of our Creative Cloud for enterprise offering.
 We offer many of the products included in Adobe Creative Cloud on a standalone basis, including subscriptions to the 
Creative Cloud version of certain point products. We also offer a range of other creative tools and services, including our hobbyist 
products such as Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements, Adobe Fonts (formerly Typekit) and mobile apps such as Photoshop 
Mix, Photoshop Sketch, Photoshop Fix, Adobe Capture, and Adobe Spark. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are 
included below under “Principal Products and Services.”
Table of Contents
6 In our Adobe Document Cloud business, Adobe Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption and a leadership position in 
document-intensive industries such as government, financial services, pharmaceutical, legal, aerospace, insurance and technical 
publishing. We believe  there remain tens of millions of users - both individuals and enterprises - who need the capabilities provided 
by Acrobat and the service capabilities found in Document Cloud. We plan to build out a data driven operating model to market 
the benefits of our Document Cloud solutions, combined with the low entry point of subscription-based pricing, to individuals as 
well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world. We intend to continue 
promoting the capabilities of our cloud-based document solutions and Adobe Sensei features to millions of Acrobat users and 
hundreds of millions of Acrobat Reader users.  We aim to increase our seat penetration in our key markets through the utilization 
of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in 
targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into 
emer ging markets. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive the enterprise business, including our 
partnership with Microsoft. Our Adobe Sign service provides a green alternative to costly paper -based solutions, and is a more 
modern and convenient way for customers to digitally manage their documents, processes, and contract workflows. The Adobe 
Scan app for mobile devices can be used to capture paper documents as images and transform them into full-featured PDFs via 
Document Cloud services that can be shared immediately , essentially putting scanning capabilities in the pocket of every person. 
We believe that by growing the awareness of electronic signatures in the broader contract delivery and signing market, utilizing 
Adobe Sensei to enhance customer experiences through machine learning and AI, and continuing to add new capabilities to our 
Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign offerings, we can help our customers migrate away from paper -based express mailing and adopt our 
solution to modernize and digitize document experiences, growing our revenue with this business in the process.
Digital Experience
Digital Experience Opportunity
 Consumers today increasingly demand compelling experiences in their digital interactions, that are seamless across channels 
and devices.  Enterprises and brands recognize that customers have more choices and lower switching costs than ever before.  In 
this new hyper -connected digital environment, it is the customer experience that differentiates brands and ultimately determines 
customer loyalty .  As a result, businesses must determine how to best attract, engage, acquire and retain customers in a digital 
world where the reach and quality of experiences directly impact success. Delivering the best experience to a consumer at a given 
moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content. Executives are increasingly demanding solutions that optimize 
their consumers’  experiences and deliver the greatest return on marketing and IT spend so they can demonstrate the business impact 
of their programs using objective metrics.
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to address these challenges and help customers transform their businesses. The 
world’ s leading brands are increasingly steering their marketing, advertising, and development budgets toward digital experiences.  
As enterprises make this move to digital, our opportunity is accelerating as brands seek vendors to help them navigate this transition. 
Enterprises have a mandate to deliver meaningful experiences to their consumers across digital channels and in areas such as sales, 
support, and product interactions where consumers expect experiences to be consistent and personalized.
 Our Adobe Experience Cloud business targets this large and growing opportunity by providing comprehensive solutions 
that include analytics, targeting, advertising optimization, digital experience management, marketing automation and engagement, 
cross-channel campaign management, content management, asset management, audience management, premium video delivery , 
digital commerce enablement, order management, predictive intelligence and monetization. These comprehensive solutions enable 
marketers to measure, personalize and optimize digital experiences across channels for optimal performance. 
 We believe the market for Adobe Experience Cloud is large and rapidly growing as more businesses and enterprises invest 
in solutions that aid their goals to transform how they engage with their customers and constituents digitally . 
Digital Experience Strategy
 Our goal is to be the leading provider of solutions that enable our customers to provide exceptional digital experiences and 
enable digital transformation.  Our integrated cloud-based solutions enable enterprises to build personalized campaigns, offer 
shoppable experiences, manage advertising, and gain deep intelligence about their customers.  Our content and data platform 
provides differentiation and competitive advantage. 
 Adobe Experience Cloud consists of the following cloud offerings:
• Adobe Advertising Cloud—delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and 
digital formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens; uses 
Adobe Sensei to enable machine learning and predictive intelligence, automates digital media buying to traditional 
TV advertising; automates ad creation and integrates with Adobe Creative Cloud products; and combines capabilities 
Table of Contents
7from the Adobe Advertising Cloud Demand-Side Platform, Adobe Advertising Cloud Search, Adobe Advertising 
Cloud TV,  and Adobe Advertising Cloud Creative offerings.
• Adobe Analytics Cloud—enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating 
audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all Adobe clouds through 
the capture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating 
that data into singular customer profiles; includes Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager . 
• Adobe Marketing Cloud—provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and 
engage their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys 
across business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) use cases; includes Adobe Experience 
Manager (“AEM”),  Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target, Marketo Engagement Platform, and Adobe Primetime.
• Magento Commerce Cloud—of fers digital commerce enablement and order orchestration for both physical and 
digital goods across a range of industries, including consumer packaged goods, retail, wholesale, manufacturing and 
the public sector , and brings together digital commerce, order management and predictive intelligence to enable 
shopping experiences that scale from mid-market to enterprise businesses.
 Adobe acquired Magento on June 18, 2018 and integrated it into the Adobe Experience Cloud as the Magento Commerce 
Cloud.  Adobe acquired Marketo on October 31, 2018 and began integrating it into the Adobe Marketing Cloud as the Marketo 
Engagement Platform.  Marketo Engagement Platform is a cloud platform for global business-to-business marketers driving new 
business growth by personalizing complex buyer journeys and empowering go-to-market teams to optimize the enterprise buyer 
experience.  As part of the Adobe Marketing Cloud, the Marketo Engagement Platform simplifies how companies plan, orchestrate 
and measure engagement with prospects and customers at every stage of their experience through both lead and account-based 
marketing strategies, while uniquely aligning marketing and sales teams across every channel through a single, enterprise-grade 
platform.
 We believe the AI and machine learning framework enabled by our strategy with Adobe Sensei enhances the delivery of 
digital experiences.  By building on existing features such as Enhanced Anomaly Detection, Auto-T arget, and other capabilities, 
we believe Adobe Sensei will increase the value we provide our customers and create a competitive differentiation in the market.
 To drive growth of Adobe Experience Cloud, we also intend to focus on customer engagement, growing within existing 
customer accounts, and product differentiation. We are also investing in the Adobe Experience Platform, which is powered by 
Adobe Sensei to help users weave all their data together so they can better understand customer behavior and deliver the best 
experiences in real time. Our Open Data Initiative is an open alliance among Adobe, Microsoft and SAP, that enables a seamless 
flow of customer data within the Adobe Experience Platform. We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Experience 
Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, SIs and ISVs that help license and 
deploy our solutions to their customers. Strategic partnerships, such as the one we have formed with Microsoft , continue to increase 
our market reach. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and believe 
these investments will result in continued growth in revenue in our Digital Experience segment in fiscal 2019 and beyond.
Publishing
 Our Publishing segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities including eLearning 
solutions, technical document publishing, web conferencing, document and forms platform, web application development and 
high-end printing. Graphics professionals and professional publishers continue to require quality , reliability and efficiency in 
production printing, and our Adobe PostScript and Adobe PDF printing technologies provide advanced functionality to meet the 
sophisticated requirements of this marketplace. As high-end printing systems evolve and transition to fully digital, composite 
workflows, we believe we are well positioned to be a supplier of software and technology based on the Adobe PostScript and 
Adobe PDF standards for use by this industry .
 We generate revenue by licensing our technology to OEMs that manufacture workflow software, printers and other output 
devices. In fiscal 2018, we maintained a relatively consistent quarterly revenue run-rate with the mature products we market and 
license in our Publishing business.

8COMPETITION
 The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving 
distribution models, disruptive technology developments, frequent product introductions, short product life cycles, price cutting 
with resulting downward pressure on gross margins and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. Our future success will depend 
on our ability to enhance and better integrate our existing products, introduce new products on a timely and cost-ef fective basis, 
meet changing customer needs, provide best-in-class information security to build customer confidence and combat cyber -attacks, 
extend our core technology into new applications and anticipate emer ging standards, business models, software delivery methods 
and other technological changes.
Digital Media
 No single company has offerings that match the capabilities of our Adobe Creative Cloud products and services, but we 
face collective competition from a variety of point offerings, free products and downloadable apps. Our competition includes 
offerings from companies such as Apple, Autodesk, Avid, Corel, Microsoft, Affinity , Quark and others, as well as from many 
lower -end offerings. We believe our greatest advantage in this space is the performance and scope of our integrated solutions, 
which work together as part of Creative Cloud. With Creative Cloud, we compete favorably on the basis of features and functionality , 
ease of use, product reliability , value and performance characteristics.
 Professional digital imaging, drawing and illustration products are characterized by feature-rich competition, brand 
awareness and price sensitivity . Competition in this space is also emer ging with drawing and illustration applications on tablet 
and smartphone platforms. The demand for professional web page layout and professional web content creation tools is constantly 
evolving and highly volatile. In this area, we face direct and indirect competition from desktop software companies and various 
proprietary and open source web-authoring tools.
 We face competition from device, hardware and camera manufacturers as they try to differentiate their offerings by bundling, 
for free, their own digital imaging software or those of our competitors. Similarly , we face potential competition from operating 
system manufacturers as they integrate or offer hobbyist-level digital imaging and image management features with their operating 
systems. We also face competition from smartphone and tablet manufacturers that integrate imaging and video software into their 
devices to work with cameras that come as part of their smartphone and tablet offerings. In addition, social networking platforms 
such as Facebook (including Instagram), Snapchat, Twitter and Pinterest, as well as portal sites such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! 
are becoming a direct means to post, edit and share images, bypassing the step of using image editing and sharing software. Online 
storage and synchronization are becoming free and ubiquitous. Consumers will be encouraged to use the image and video editing 
software offered by those storage products, thus competing with our software.
 In addition, the needs of digital imaging and video editing software users are constantly evolving due to rapid technology 
and hardware advancements in digital cameras, digital video cameras, printers, personal computers, tablets, smartphones and other 
new devices. Our imaging and video offerings, including Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects, Premiere Pro, and Premiere Rush, 
face competition from established and emer ging companies offering similar products.
 New image editing applications for mobile devices and tablets with features that compete with our professional tools are 
also emer ging as adoption of these devices grows. Our consumer digital imaging and video editing offerings are subject to intense 
competition, including customer price sensitivity and competitor brand awareness. We face direct and indirect competition in the 
consumer digital imaging space from a number of companies whose market software competes with our offerings.
 The stock content marketplace has significant competition, especially in the microstock segment, where Adobe primarily 
operates today with our Adobe Stock offering. Key competitors in this segment include Shutterstock, Getty Images and a number 
of smaller companies.  Deep product integration with Adobe Creative Cloud and superior reach and relationships with creative 
professionals around the world differentiate our Adobe Stock offerings.
 The nature of traditional digital document creation, storage, and collaboration has been rapidly evolving as knowledge 
workers and consumers shift their behavior increasingly to non-desktop workflows. Competitors like Microsoft, Google, Box and 
Dropbox all offer competitive alternatives to our Adobe Document Cloud business for creating and managing PDFs. In addition, 
other PDF creation solutions can be found at a low cost or for free on the web or via mobile applications. To address these 
competitive threats, we are working to ensure our Document Cloud applications stay at the forefront of innovation in emer ging 
opportunities such as PDF document generation, document collaboration and document security , document workflow management, 
easeful software integrations, enablement of paper to digital transformations, and accessibility and usability on multiple devices,

9 E-signatures have quickly become a core element of digital documents and are inherently part of a company’ s digital 
document transformation efforts. Partnerships and integrations between these companies and third-parties create an increasingly 
competitive landscape in this space.  Competitors to Adobe Sign include DocuSign. 
Digital Experience
 The markets in which our Digital Experience business unit competes are growing rapidly and characterized by intense 
competition. Our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions face competition from large companies such as Google, IBM, Oracle, 
salesforce.com, SAP, SAS, Teradata, Shopify and others, in addition to point product solutions and focused competitors. 
Additionally , new competitors are constantly entering these markets. Some of these competitors provide SaaS solutions to 
customers, generally through a web browser , while others provide software that is installed by customers directly on their servers. 
In addition, we compete at times with our customers’  or potential customers’  internally developed applications. Of the competitors 
listed above, no single company has products identical to our Adobe Experience Cloud offerings. Adobe Experience Cloud competes 
in a variety of areas, including: reporting and analytics; cross-channel marketing and optimization; online marketing; audience 
management; advertising and real-time bidding technology; video delivery and monetization; marketing automation; digital 
commerce enablement; order management; web experience management and others.
 Large software, internet and database management companies have expanded their offerings in the digital experience area, 
either by developing competing services or by acquiring existing competitors or strategic partners of ours. We believe competitive 
factors in our markets include the proven performance, security , scalability , flexibility and reliability of services; the strategic 
relationships and integration with third-party applications; the intuitiveness and visual appeal of user interfaces; demonstrable 
cost-ef fective benefits to customers; pricing; the flexibility of services to match changing business demands; enterprise-level 
customer service and training; perceived market leadership; the usability of services; real-time data and reporting; independence 
from portals and search engines; the ability to deploy the services globally; and success in educating customers in how to utilize 
services effectively . We believe we compete favorably with both the enterprise and low-cost alternatives based on many of these 
competitive factors including our strong feature set, the breadth of our offerings, our focus on global, multi-brand companies, our 
superior user experience, tools for building multi-screen, cross-channel applications, standards-based architecture, scalability and 
performance and leadership in industry standards efforts.
 Creative and digital agencies, as well as SIs, are increasingly investing in acquiring their own digital experience technology 
to complement their creative services offerings. Adobe may face competition from these agencies and SIs as they come to market 
with best-of-breed offerings in one or more digital experience capabilities, or if agencies attempt to create a more complete 
technology platform offering. We believe our creative tools heritage differentiates us from our competitors. We have worked 
closely with marketing and creative customers for over 30 years. We also believe we have leadership in this space, with current 
customers representing leading global brands. Our comprehensive solutions extend more broadly than any other company in 
serving the needs of marketers and addressing this market opportunity; we integrate content and data, analytics, personalization, 
digital experience management, marketing automation, cross-channel campaign management, digital commerce, audience 
management, video delivery and monetization and social capabilities in our Adobe Experience Cloud. Most importantly , we provide 
a vision for our digital experience customers as we engage with them across the important aspects of their business, extending 
from their use of Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud to how they manage, deliver , measure and monetize their 
content, participate in digital commerce, and create highly personalized and engaging shoppable experiences with our Experience 
Cloud.
Publishing
 Our Publishing product offerings face competition from large-scale publishing systems, XML-based publishing companies, 
as well as lower -end desktop publishing products. Similarly , our web conferencing product faces competition from a number of 
established products from other companies, including Cisco, Citrix and Microsoft. Competition involves a number of factors, 
including: product features, ease-of-use, printer service support, the level of customization and integration with other publishing 
system components, the number of hardware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete 
based upon the quality and features of our products, our strong brand among users, the widespread adoption of our products among 
printer service bureaus, and our extensive application programming interfaces.
 In printing technologies, we believe the principal competitive factors for OEMs in selecting a page description language 
or a printing technology are product capabilities, market leadership, reliability , price, support and engineering development 
assistance. We believe that our competitive advantages include our technology competency , OEM customer relationships and our 
intellectual property portfolio.

use our desktop software and mobile apps.  We license our desktop software to users under ‘click through’  or signed license 
agreements containing restrictions on duplication, disclosure, and transfer . Similarly , cloud products and services are provided to 
users under ‘click through’  or signed agreements containing restrictions on access and use.
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may 
attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our application. Policing 
unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our transition from perpetual-use 
software licenses to a subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing has and 
may continue to improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.

20ITEM 1A.  RISK FACT ORS
As previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Below we discuss 
some of the factors that could cause these differences. These and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect 
our operations, performance and financial condition.
Our competitive position and results of operations could be harmed if we do not compete effectively .
The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving 
distribution models, limited barriers to entry , disruptive technology developments, short product life cycles, customer price 
sensitivity and frequent product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower costs or free of 
charge). Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal 
and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our future success will depend on our continued 
ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-
effective manner , meet changing customer expectations and needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate 
emer ging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. Furthermore, some of 
our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and 
other resources, broader brand awareness, and access to larger customer bases. As a result of these advantages, potential and current 
customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of our market share. In addition, consolidation 
has occurred among some of our competitors. Further consolidations in these markets may subject us to increased competitive 
pressures and may harm our results of operations.
For additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive envir onment in which we 
operate, see the section entitled “Competition” contained in Part I. Item 1 of this report.
If we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products 
and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.
The process of developing and acquiring new technology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex, 
costly and uncertain. If we fail to anticipate customers’  rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emer ging technological 
trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments, develop, acquire or obtain 
appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect 
customer demand for our products and services. If we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new products and services may 
not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed. Additionally , any delay in the development, acquisition, marketing or 
launch of a new offering or enhancement to an existing offering could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract 
new customers, causing a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position. 
We offer our products on a variety of hardware platforms. Consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet 
and mobile devices. If we cannot continue adapting our products to tablet and mobile devices, or if our competitors can adapt their 
products more quickly than us, our business could be harmed. Releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more 
difficult for our products to perform or may require significant costs in order for us to adapt our solutions to such devices or 
operating systems. These potential costs and delays could harm our business.
Introduction of new technology could harm our business and results of operations.
The expectations and needs of technology consumers are constantly evolving.  Our future success depends on a variety of 
factors, including our continued ability to innovate, introduce new products and services efficiently , enhance and integrate our 
products and services in a timely and cost-ef fective manner , extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate 
emer ging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. Integration of our products 
and services with one another and other companies’  offerings creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is partly reliant on 
third parties. If any disruptive technology , or competing products, services or operating systems that are not compatible with our 
solutions, achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer and our business could be harmed. 
The introduction of certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products. For example, some of our products 
rely on third-party cookies, which are placed on individual browsers when consumers visit websites that contain advertisements. 
We use these cookies to help our customers more effectively advertise, gauge the performance of their advertisements, and detect 
and prevent fraudulent activity . Consumers can block or delete cookies through their browsers or “ad-blocking” software or 
applications. The most common Internet browsers allow consumers to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being 
accepted by their browsers, or are set to block third-party cookies by default. Increased use of methods, software or applications 
that block cookies could harm our business.

21Security breaches in data centers we manage, or third parties manage on our behalf, may compromise the confidentiality , 
integrity , or availability of employee and customer data, which could expose us to liability and adversely affect our reputation 
and business.
We process and store significant amounts of employee and customer data, most of which is hosted by third-party service 
providers. A security incident impacting our own data centers or those controlled by our service providers may compromise the 
confidentiality , integrity or availability of this data. Unauthorized access to or loss or disclosure of data stored by Adobe or our 
service providers may occur through break-ins, breaches of a secure network by an unauthorized party , software vulnerabilities 
or coding errors, employee theft or misuse or other misconduct. It is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of 
customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers or employees. Accounts created with 
weak or recycled passwords could allow cyber -attackers to gain access to customer data. Additionally , failure by customers to 
remove accounts of their own employees, or the granting of accounts by the customer in an uncontrolled manner , may allow for 
access by former or unauthorized customer representatives. If there were an inadvertent disclosure of customer data, or if a third 
party were to gain unauthorized access to the data we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our 
reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to claims or other liabilities, regulatory investigations, or fines. In addition, 
such perceived or actual unauthorized loss or disclosure of the information we collect or breach of our security could damage our 
reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our business.
We rely on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host and deliver our services, as well as access, collect, 
use, transmit, and store data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, or failures in data collection or transmission 
could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation.
Much of our business relies on hardware and services that are hosted, managed, and controlled directly by Adobe or third-
party service providers, including our online store at adobe.com, Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud solutions. 
We do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our 
disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. If our business relationship with a third-party provider of hosting 
or content delivery services is negatively affected, or if one of our content delivery suppliers were to terminate its agreement with 
us, without adequate notice, we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offerings to our customers, which could 
subject us to reputational harm, costly and time intensive notification requirements, and cause us to lose customers and future 
business. Occasionally , we migrate data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments. If a transition among data 
centers or to third-party service providers encounters unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity , or unplanned disruptions 
despite precautions undertaken during the process, this may impair our delivery of products and services to customers and result 
in increased costs and liabilities, which may harm our operating results and our business.
It is also possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) 
could result in data loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect or maintain to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies 
that our customers regard as significant, or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels or comply with regulatory notification 
requirements. Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including 
access to the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic 
on customer websites. In addition, computer viruses, worms, or other malware may harm our systems, causing us to lose data, and 
the transmission of computer viruses or other malware could expose us to litigation or regulatory investigation, and costly and 
time intensive notification requirements. 
We may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real time because of a 
number of factors, including significant spikes in customer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software, or the 
failure of our third-party service providers’  network or software. If we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand 
it proportionally with the needs of our customer base, and we experience a rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our 
data centers or those of third parties, service outages could occur , and our customers could suffer impaired performance of our 
services. Such a strain on our infrastructure capacity could subject us to regulatory notification requirements, violations of service 
level agreement commitments, financial liabilities, result in customer dissatisfaction, or harm our business. If we supply inaccurate 
information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store and supply information in near real time or at all, our 
reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers as a result, or we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses.  
Increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws could impact our business models and expose us to increased 
liability .
As a global company , Adobe is subject to global privacy and data security laws, regulations, and codes of conduct that apply 
to our various business units.  These laws and regulations may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and 
differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations.  Government regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are 
Table of Contents
22increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. This increased scrutiny may 
result in new interpretations of existing laws, thereby further impacting Adobe’ s business. Globally , new and emer ging laws, such 
as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in Europe, state laws in the U.S. on privacy , data and related technologies, 
such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, as well as industry self-regulatory codes create new compliance obligations and 
expand the scope of potential liability , either jointly or severally with our customers and suppliers.   While we have invested in 
readiness to comply with applicable requirements, these new and emer ging laws, regulations and codes may affect our ability (and 
our enterprise customers’  ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to both enterprise and individual customer 
requests under the laws (such as individual rights of access, correction, and deletion of their personal information), and to implement 
our business models effectively . These new laws may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and 
emer ging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning). These requirements, among others, may impact demand 
for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts. Any perception of our practices, 
products or services as a violation of individual privacy rights may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational 
harm, or investigations or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and 
expose us to increased liability . Additionally , we collect and store information on behalf of our business customers and if our 
customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws, it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us.
Transferring personal information across international borders is becoming increasingly complex. For example, European 
data transfers outside the European Economic Area are highly regulated. The mechanisms that we and many other companies rely 
upon for European data transfers (e.g. Privacy Shield and Model Clauses) are being contested in the European court system. We 
are closely monitoring developments related to requirements for transferring personal data outside the EU and other countries that 
have similar trans-border data flow requirements. These requirements may result in an increase in the obligations required to 
provide our services in the EU or in sanctions and fines for non-compliance. Several other countries, including Australia and Japan, 
have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information. Other countries, such as India, 
are considering requirements for data localization (e.g. where personal data must remain in the country).  If the mechanisms for 
transferring personal information from certain countries or areas, including Europe to the United States should be found invalid 
or if other countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border data transfers (or not permit data to leave the country 
of origin), such developments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Security vulnerabilities in our products and systems could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims.
Maintaining the security of our products, computers and networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. Security 
researchers, criminal hackers and other third parties regularly develop new techniques to penetrate computer and network security 
measures and, as we have previously disclosed, certain parties have in the past managed to breach and misuse some of our systems 
and software in order to access our end users’  authentication and payment information. In addition, cyber -attackers also develop 
and deploy viruses, worms, credential stuffing attack tools, and other malicious software programs, some of which may be 
specifically designed to attack our products, systems, computers or networks. Sophisticated hardware and operating system 
applications that we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs, 
vulnerabilities and other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair a customer ’s ability 
to operate or use our products. The costs to prevent, eliminate, notify affected parties of, or alleviate cyber - or other security 
problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities are significant, and our efforts to address 
these problems may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of 
existing or potential customers. It is impossible to predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us.
Outside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products 
or services to disclose sensitive information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. Unauthorized parties may 
also attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems or attempt to gain logical access 
to our products, services, or information systems for the purpose of exfiltrating content and data. These actual and potential breaches 
of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information 
or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees, our customers or their end users, including the potential loss 
or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our 
employees, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. This may result in litigation 
and liability or fines, our compliance with costly and time intensive notice requirements, governmental inquiry or oversight or a 
loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, possibly impeding our 
present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers and thereby requiring time and resources to repair our brand 
and reputation. These risks will likely increase as we expand our hosted offerings, integrate our products and services, and store 
and process more data, including personal information.
These problems affect our products and services in particular because cyber -attackers tend to focus their efforts on popular 
offerings with a large user base, and we expect them to continue to do so. Critical vulnerabilities may be identified in some of our 
Table of Contents
23applications and services and those of our third-party service providers. These vulnerabilities could cause such applications and 
services to crash and could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system, which could result in liability to us or limit 
our ability to conduct our business and deliver our products and services to customers. We devote significant resources to address 
security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and 
systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities, reviewing 
our service providers’  security controls, and improving our incident response time, but these security vulnerabilities cannot be 
totally eliminated. The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins, and we may be unable to implement these measures 
quickly enough to prevent cyber -attackers from gaining unauthorized access into our systems and products. Despite our preventative 
efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims against 
us (and have in the past led to such claims), and could lead some customers to stop using certain products or services, to reduce 
or delay future purchases of products or services, or to use competing products or services. If we do not make the appropriate level 
of investment in our technology systems or if our systems become out-of-date or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality 
of data security customers require, our business could be adversely affected. Customers may also adopt security measures designed 
to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Further , if we or our 
customers are subject to a future attack, or our technology is used in a third-party attack, we could be subject to costly and time 
intensive notice requirements, and it may be necessary for us to take additional extraordinary measures and make additional 
expenditures to take appropriate responsive and preventative steps. Any of these events could adversely affect our revenue or 
margins. Moreover , delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from disruptions caused by cyber -attacks or 
preventative measures could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
Some of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which can make our sales cycles unpredictable.
Sales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and ETLAs in our Digital 
Media business, are multi-phased and complex. The complexity in these sales cycles is due to several factors, including:
• the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of large-scale deployments of our 
products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings and return on investment;
• the desire of organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements 
prior to making information technology expenditures;
 
• the need for our representatives to spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and 
evaluation of our products and services;
• intensifying competition within the industry; 
• the negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts;
• the need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations due 
to the complexity of our solutions touching multiple departments within customers’  organizations; and
• customer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.
We spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without assurance that potential customers will ultimately 
purchase our solutions.  As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and 
could have a greater impact on our results of operations.  Additionally , our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, 
where a higher percentage of a quarter ’s total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter , which is common in our industry .  
Our extended sales cycle for these products and services makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.
Subscription offerings could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.  
We generally recognize revenue from subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which 
range from 1 to 36 months. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription 
agreements entered into during previous quarters. Any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may not be reflected 
in our revenue results until a later quarter .  Declines in new or renewed subscriptions may decrease our revenue in future quarters.  
Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services, and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our 
results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue 
from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized 
over the applicable subscription term. 
Table of Contents
24Additionally , in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers and our use of ETLAs, a number of factors could 
affect our revenue, including longer -than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue due to multiple-
element revenue arrangements and alternative licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our 
subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated.
If our customers fail to renew subscriptions in accordance with our expectations, our future revenue and operating results 
could suffer.
Our Adobe Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Document Cloud offerings typically involve subscription-based offerings 
pursuant to product and service agreements. Revenue from our subscription customers is generally recognized ratably over the 
term of their agreements, which typically range from 1 to 36 months.  Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions 
for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, and customers may not renew their subscriptions at the 
same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats or for the same duration of time, if at all. Moreover , under certain 
circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their agreements prior to the expiration of the terms. Our varied 
customer base combined with the flexibility we offer in the length of our subscription-based agreements complicates our ability 
to precisely forecast renewal rates. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer 
renewal rates.
Our customers’  renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction 
with our services, our ability to continue enhancing features and functionality , the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription 
offerings, the prices of offerings and those offered by our competitors, the actual or perceived information security of our systems 
and services, decreases in the size of our customer base, reductions in our customers’  spending levels or declines in customer 
activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions 
or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.
We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments or acquisitions, and integration of acquisitions may 
disrupt our business and management.
We may not realize the anticipated benefits of an investment or acquisition of a company , division, product or technology , 
each of which involves numerous risks. These risks include:
• inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;
• difficulty in, and the cost of, ef fectively integrating the operations, technologies, products or services, and personnel 
of the acquired business;
• entry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger 
market positions;
• disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other employees from other opportunities 
and challenges;
• inability to retain personnel of the acquired business;
• inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;
• inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits;
• incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating 
results;
• elevated delinquency or bad debt write-of fs related to receivables of the acquired business we assume;
• increased accounts receivables collection times and working capital requirements associated with acquired business 
models;
• additional costs of bringing acquired companies into compliance with laws and regulations applicable to a multinational 
corporation;
• difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;
Table of Contents
25• impairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners, distributors or third-party providers of our 
technologies, products or services;
• failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired 
company or technology;
• exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an 
acquisition, such as claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;
• incurring significant exit char ges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;
• inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are ef fective;
• inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner , approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent 
such acquisitions; 
• the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections;
• delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service 
offerings; and
• incompatibility of business cultures.
Mergers and acquisitions of technology companies are inherently risky . If we do not complete an announced acquisition 
transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner , we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition 
to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position.
Our business could be harmed if we fail to ef fectively manage critical strategic third-party business relationships.
As our offerings expand and our customer base grows, our relationships with strategic partners become increasingly valuable.  
If our contractual relationships with these third parties were to terminate, or if we were unable to renew on favorable terms, our 
business could be harmed.  This is especially the case when the third party’ s offerings are integrated with our products and services, 
or where the third party’ s offerings are difficult to substitute or replace.  Alternative arrangements for such products and services 
may not be available to us, or on commercially reasonable terms, and we may experience business interruptions upon a transition 
to an alternative partner .  The failure of third parties to provide acceptable products and services or to update their technology may 
result in a disruption to our business operations and those of our customers, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause us 
to lose customers and damage our reputation.
We face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation.
As a global business that generates approximately 43% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the Americas, 
we are subject to a number of risks, including:
• foreign currency fluctuations and controls;
• international and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns abroad;
• tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries);
• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
• changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;
• changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;
• failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately;
• inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;
Table of Contents
26• delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology , tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers;
• the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand 
our business;
• costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages;
• operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and
• other factors beyond our control, such as terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics.
Some of our third-party business partners have international operations and are also subject to these risks and if our third-
party business partners are unable to appropriately manage these risks, our business may be harmed.  If sales to any of our customers 
outside of the Americas are reduced, delayed or canceled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may decline.
We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally , which may harm our business.
We are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally . 
These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, 
data and transaction processing security , payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated 
content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency , corporate governance, anti-trust and competition, 
employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, gift policies, conflicts of interest, securities regulations and other regulatory 
requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and 
may at times conflict. For example, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to 
engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
We cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, and business partners will not take actions in violation of 
our internal policies or U.S. laws. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes 
in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability . Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, 
criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our 
reputation. 
In addition, approximately 49% of our employees are located outside the United States. Accordingly , we are exposed to 
changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations 
regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy , unemployment tax rates, workers’  compensation 
rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. 
Changes in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and 
results of operations.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America (“GAAP”). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and 
create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles, how the principles are interpreted, or the adoption of new 
accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results, and could even retroactively affect previously reported 
transactions, and may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.
Changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we 
change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls. For additional 
information regarding these new standards, see the section titled “Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective” within 
Part II. Item 8, Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Such changes in accounting principles may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and income, or cause 
an adverse deviation from our revenue and profitability targets, which may negatively impact our financial results. 
Changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our effective tax rates.
We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. The Tax 
Act, enacted into law on December 22, 2017, changes existing U.S. tax law applicable to us and includes adoption of a territorial 
tax system requiring us to incur a transition tax on previously untaxed earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries.  A significant 
portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. As part of the adoption of a territorial 
Table of Contents
27tax system, the Tax Act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made 
after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. In addition, certain international provisions introduced 
in the Tax Act will be effective for us in fiscal 2019. These provisions and changes that we may make to our corporate tax structure 
could adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years.
Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to 
discrete items and to tax on earnings from foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 
of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our 
income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by 
unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by unexpected negative changes in 
business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and 
liabilities.
In addition, in the United States, the European Commission, countries in the European Union and other countries where 
we do business, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, 
including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries and other governmental bodies 
have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way 
in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in 
such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to 
these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations 
and financial results.
 Moreover , we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service 
(“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer 
pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to 
determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. 
We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our 
operating results and financial position.
Uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any 
of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results.
As our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in economic 
and political conditions, both domestically and globally . Uncertainty about the effects of current and future economic and political 
conditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions 
about future investments. If economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology 
purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, more 
extended sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Among our customers are government 
entities, including the U.S. federal government, and our revenue could decline if spending cuts impact the government’ s ability 
to purchase our products and services. Deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could 
also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
A disruption in financial markets could impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management and 
affect our derivative counterparties. Any of these events would likely harm our business, financial condition, and results of 
operations.
Political instability or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business 
would also likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
The success of some of our product and service of ferings depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers 
of and contributors to our online marketplaces for creative content.
The success of some of our product and service offerings, such as Adobe Stock, depends on our ability to continue to attract 
new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content, as well as our ability to continue to retain existing 
customers and contributors. An increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from contributors, which 
increases the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customers. We rely on the functionality and features of our 
online marketplaces, the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts to attract new customers 
and contributors and retain existing ones. New technologies may render the features of our online marketplaces obsolete, our 
Table of Contents
28collection may fail to grow as anticipated or our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful, any of which may adversely affect our 
results of operations.
Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including 
our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.
Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset. Infringement or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks, trade 
secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights could result in lost revenues and ultimately reduce their value. Preventing 
unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. We actively combat software piracy as 
we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. If piracy 
activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further harm our business. We apply for patents in the U.S. and 
internationally to protect our newly created technology and if we are unable to obtain patent protection for the technology described 
in our pending patent, or if the patent is not obtained timely , this could result in revenue loss, adverse effects on operations, and 
harm to our business.   We offer our products and services in foreign countries and we may seek intellectual property protection 
from those foreign legal systems.  Some of those foreign countries may not have as robust or comprehensive of intellectual property 
protection laws and schemes as those offered in the U.S.  In some foreign countries, the mechanisms to enforce intellectual property 
rights may be inadequate to protect our technology , which could harm our business.  
If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber -attack or otherwise, we could lose 
future trade secret protection for that source code. The loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties 
to compete with our products by copying functionality , which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our 
revenue and operating margins. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-
disclosure agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. However , there is a risk that our confidential 
information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations, enforcing our rights 
may be difficult or costly .
We may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights.
We have been, are currently , and may in the future be, subject to claims, negotiations and complex, protracted litigation 
relating to disputes regarding the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. 
Intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the 
attention of management and key personnel. We may not prevail in every lawsuit or dispute. Third-party intellectual property 
disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into 
royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of 
our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the 
markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual 
provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements. In addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring 
the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with 
our customers. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.
We may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.
Our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global scope of our business. 
Global economic events, including trade disputes, economic sanctions and emer ging market volatility , and associated uncertainty 
may cause currencies to fluctuate. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging based on our 
judgment of the appropriate trade-of fs among risk, opportunity and expense. We regularly review our program to partially hedge 
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and make adjustments as necessary . Our hedging activities may not offset more than 
a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could 
adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
Failure of our third-party customer service and technical support providers to adequately address customers’  requests could 
harm our business and adversely affect our financial results.
Our customers rely on our customer service support organization to resolve issues with our products and services. We 
outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to third-party service providers. We depend 
heavily on these third-party customer service and technical support representatives working on our behalf, and we expect to 
continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This strategy presents risks to our business due to the fact that we may not 
be able to influence the quality of support as directly as we would be able to do if our own employees performed these activities. 
Our customers may react negatively to providing information to, and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially 
if these third-party organizations are based overseas. If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical 
Table of Contents
29support providers, our reputation may be harmed, our ability to sell our offerings could be adversely affected, and we could lose 
customers and associated revenue.
Revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to 
decline.
In the past, the market price for our common stock experienced significant fluctuations and it may do so in the future. A 
number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, such as:
• shortfalls in, or changes in expectations about our revenue, margins, earnings, Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”), 
sales of our Adobe Experience Cloud offerings, or other key performance metrics;
• changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;
• whether our results meet analysts’  expectations;
• compression or expansion of multiples used by investors and analysts to value high technology SaaS companies;
• the announcement of new products or services, product enhancements, service introductions, strategic alliances or 
significant agreements by us or our competitors;
• the loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain customers or attract new 
customers;
• recruitment or departure of key personnel;
• variations in our or our competitors’  results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and 
developments in our industry; 
• general socio-economic, political or market conditions; and
• unusual events such as significant acquisitions by us or our competitors, divestitures, litigation, regulatory actions and 
other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance. 
In addition, the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general may experience uneven investor confidence, 
which may cause the market price for our common stock to decline for reasons unrelated to our operating performance. Volatility 
in the market price of a company’ s securities for a period of time may increase the company’ s susceptibility to securities class 
action litigation. Oftentimes, this type of litigation is expensive and diverts management’ s attention and resources which may 
adversely affect our business. 
Contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process. 
We provide products and services, directly and indirectly , to a variety of government entities, both domestically and 
internationally . Risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include more extended 
sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and 
other government-specific contractual requirements. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government 
contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination 
of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation 
and financial results.
If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed.
Much of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management. 
These individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Adobe. The loss of any of these individuals could 
harm our business, especially if we have not been successful in developing adequate succession plans. Our business is also dependent 
on our ability to retain, hire and motivate talented, highly skilled personnel across all levels of our organization. Experienced 
personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in many areas 
where our employees are located. We may experience higher compensation costs to retain senior management and experienced 
personnel that may not be offset by improved productivity or increased sales. If we are unable to continue to successfully attract 
and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed. 
Table of Contents
30We continue to hire personnel in countries where exceptional technical knowledge and other expertise are offered at lower 
costs, which increases the efficiency of our global workforce structure and reduces our personnel related expenditures.  Nonetheless, 
as globalization continues, competition for these employees in these countries has increased, which may impact our ability to 
retain these employees and increase our expenses resulting from competitive compensation. We may continue to expand our 
international operations and international sales and marketing activities, which would require significant management attention 
and resources. We may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our 
revenue may not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, causing our results to suffer.  
We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster 
innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. As we grow , including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired 
in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, 
which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.
Failure to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm to our business.
We contract with a number of software distributors and other strategic partners, none of which is individually responsible 
for a material amount of our total net revenue for any recent period. Nonetheless, if any single agreement with one of our distributors 
were terminated, any prolonged delay in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
Successfully managing our indirect distribution channel efforts to reach various customer segments for our products and 
services is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business. Our distributors 
and other channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. Notwithstanding the independence of our channel 
partners, we face legal risk and potential reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited to, 
export control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive behavior . 
We cannot be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or sell our products and services effectively . If 
our distribution channel is not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenue. Our distributors also sell our 
competitors’  products and services, and if they favor our competitors’  products or services for any reason, they may fail to market 
our products or services effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, which would cause our results to 
suffer. We also distribute some products and services through our OEM channel, and if our OEMs decide not to bundle our 
applications on their devices, our results could suffer. In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing 
relationships with them are important to our success. Some of these distributors may be unable to withstand adverse changes in 
economic conditions, which could result in insolvency , the inability of such distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of 
our products and services, or a delay in paying their obligations to us.
We also sell some of our products and services through our direct sales force. Risks associated with this sales channel 
include more extended sales and collection cycles associated with direct sales efforts, challenges related to hiring, retaining and 
motivating our direct sales force, and substantial amounts of ongoing training for sales representatives. Moreover , recent hires 
may not become as productive as we would like, as in most cases it takes a significant period of time before they achieve full 
productivity . Our business could be seriously harmed if our expansion efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase 
in revenue and we are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate. In addition, the loss of key sales employees could impact 
our customer relationships and future ability to sell to certain accounts covered by such employees.
If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, then we could be required to record a significant charge to 
earnings.
GAAP  requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually . In addition, we review our goodwill and amortizable 
intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible 
assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows, and slower growth rates in our 
industry . Depending on the results of our review , we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial 
statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively 
impacting our results of operations.
We have issued $1.9 billion of notes in debt offerings and have a $2.25 billion term loan, and may incur other debt in the future, 
which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results. 
We have $1.9 billion in senior unsecured notes and a $2.25 billion senior unsecured term loan outstanding. We also have a 
$1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is currently undrawn. This debt may adversely affect our financial 
condition and future financial results by, among other things: 
Table of Contents
31• increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions;
• requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby 
reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; 
and
• limiting our flexibility in planning for , or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry .
Our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreements impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain 
compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. 
If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure 
periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.
In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our 
debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Under certain circumstances, if 
our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility 
and term loan could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such financing and restrict our 
ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
We are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology 
systems and website for our development, marketing, operations, support, hosted services and sales activities. In addition, some 
of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving 
our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability . A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or 
third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, 
telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics, cyber -attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic 
event that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of 
intellectual property , delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss 
of critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’  orders or could negatively impact a country 
or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country’ s or region’ s demand for our products. Our 
corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and certain 
other critical business operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and additional facilities where we conduct significant 
operations are located in the Salt Lake Valley Area, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results 
in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely 
affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected.
Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.
 While we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize 
that there are inherent risks wherever business is conducted.  Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where 
we conduct our business, whether for our offices or for our vendors, is a priority .  Our major sites in California, Utah and India 
are vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. In the event of a natural disaster that disrupts business due to limited 
access to these resources, we have the potential to experience losses to our business, and added costs to resume operations. To 
accurately assess and take potential proactive action as appropriate, Adobe is aligned with the guidelines of the Financial Stability 
Board’ s (“FSB”)  Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations.
Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.
Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of November 30, 2018 consisted of corporate debt securities, 
foreign government securities and U.S. Treasury securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities, time deposits and 
asset-backed securities. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure 
to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer , as well as 
our maximum exposure to various asset classes.
Should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising 
from market liquidity and credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and 
expense to vary from expectations. As of November 30, 2018, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-
term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we

portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.

33ITEM 3.  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS  
In connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, 
including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted 
litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by 
diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or 
resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual 
property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable 
terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our 
sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy 
indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service 
agreements.
In addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary 
course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal 
proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a 
quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP  and, based on known facts, assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably 
possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue 
for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of the 
Board of Directors and our independent registered public accounting firm.
We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss 
can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, 
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise 
specifically disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, we have determined that no provision for liability 
or disclosure is required related to any claim against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding 
amounts already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss 
cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is immaterial.
All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However , we 
believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our 
consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of 
one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.
In connection with our piracy conversion efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business 
Software Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to 
counter -claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to 
such counter -claims; however , it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be 
negatively affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter -claims.

36ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESUL TS OF 
OPERA TIONS  
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.
ACQUISITIONS 
During fiscal 2018, we completed our acquisitions of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company , for 
$4.74 billion  and Magento, a privately held commerce platform company , for $1.64 billion . As of the end of fiscal 2018, we are 
continuing to integrate Marketo and Magento into our Digital Experience reportable segment.
During fiscal 2017, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company , for 
$560.8 million . As of the end of fiscal 2018, we have integrated TubeMogul into our Digital Experience reportable segment. 
We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. 
See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for pro forma financial information related to the Marketo 
acquisition. Pro forma information has not been presented for our other acquisitions during the fiscal years presented as the impact 
to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.
Subsequent to November 30, 2018 , we acquired the remaining interest in Allegorithmic SAS (“Allegorithmic”), a privately 
held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, for approximately  $105.0 million  in cash 
consideration. Allegorithmic will be integrated into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the 
first quarter of fiscal 2019.
See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. 
CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMA TES
In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP  and pursuant to the rules and regulations of 
the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, 
and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical 
experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially 
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and 
estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for business combinations and income 
taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results 
of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical 
accounting policies. Historically , our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not 
differed materially from actual results.
Business Combinations
We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make 
significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations.  Although we believe the 
assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and 
information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates 
in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:
• future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and 
acquired developed technologies and patents;
• historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;
• the acquired company’ s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired 
trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’ s product portfolio;
• the expected use of the acquired assets; and 
• discount rates.
Table of Contents
37In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue 
obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-
up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. 
Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates 
or actual results.
Accounting for  Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized 
for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates 
to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax 
laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic 
tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could 
be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. 
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We expect future examinations to focus on our 
intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from 
these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that 
may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however , the final determination of any of these 
examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements 
that are of significance, or potential significance to us. 
RESUL TS OF  OPERA TIONS
Overview of 2018
For fiscal 2018, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our 
two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Experience (formerly Digital Marketing), while continuing to market and 
license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.
In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides 
desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich and immersive content. Creative 
Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-based services 
including storage and syncing of files across users’  machines, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with 
our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team 
collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.
We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained 
long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users on account of low cost of 
entry and delivery of additional features and value to Creative Cloud, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest 
release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content 
in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, 
attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably .
We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our 
Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop 
and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and 
ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License 
Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.
We are also a market leader with our Adobe Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, 
including Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe Sign. Acrobat 
provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Document 
Table of Contents
38Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes 
Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review , approve, sign and track 
documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through 
subscription and perpetual licenses.
Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health 
and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and 
unbilled deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust 
our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2018 are 
based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2018 and held constant throughout the year. We calculate ARR as follows:
Creative ARRAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services
+ 
Annual Digital Publishing Suite Contract Value 
+ 
Annual Creative ETLA  Contract Value 
Document Cloud ARRAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services 
+
Annual Document Cloud ETLA  Contract Value
Digital Media ARRCreative ARR
+ 
Document Cloud ARR
Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2018  was $6.03 billion , up from $4.77 billion  at the end of fiscal 2017 . Document Cloud ARR 
exiting fiscal 2018  was $801 million , up from $614 million  at the end of fiscal 2017 . Total Digital Media ARR grew to $6.83 
billion  at the end of fiscal 2018 , up from $5.39 billion  at the end of fiscal 2017 . Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2018  using 
currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2019 , our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2018  would be $6.71 billion  or 
approximately $123 million  lower  than the ARR reported above.
Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2018  was 
$5.34 billion , up from $4.17 billion  in fiscal 2017  and representing 28% year-over -year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 
2018  was $981.8 million , up from $836.7 million  in fiscal 2017  and representing 17% year-over -year revenue growth as we 
continue to transition Document Cloud to a subscription-based model. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $6.33 billion
in fiscal 2018 , up from $5.01 billion  in fiscal 2017  and representing 26% year-over -year growth. 
We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. Our Digital Experience 
business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital 
experience management, cross-channel campaign management, marketing automation, audience management, commerce, 
premium video delivery and monetization. These comprehensive solutions enable marketers to measure, personalize and optimize 
marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance.
Our hierarchy of solutions in the Digital Experience segment, available in our Adobe Experience Cloud, consists of the 
following cloud offerings:
• Adobe Advertising Cloud—delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital 
formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens.
• Adobe Analytics Cloud—enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating 
audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all Adobe clouds through the 
Table of Contents
39capture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating that data 
into singular customer profiles; includes Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager .
• Adobe Marketing Cloud—provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage 
their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys; includes 
Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”), Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target, Marketo Engagement Platform and Adobe 
Primetime.
• Magento Commerce Cloud—provides digital commerce, order management and predictive intelligence based on a unified 
commerce platform enabling shopping experiences across a wide array of industries. This cloud offering was integrated 
into the Adobe Experience Cloud after our acquisition of privately held Magento in June 2018.
In addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital marketers, users of our Adobe Experience Cloud 
solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, digital marketers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers 
and marketing executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital 
Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience business, 
we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel 
with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.
In October 2018, we acquired privately held marketing cloud platform company Marketo. We began integrating Magento, 
as discussed above, and Marketo into our Digital Experience business in the second half of fiscal 2018.
We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem 
of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our 
solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, 
and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. 
We achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $2.44 billion  in fiscal 2018 , up from $2.03 billion in fiscal 2017 
which represents 20% year-over -year growth. Driving the increase in Adobe Experience Cloud revenue was the increase in 
subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $1.95 billion  in fiscal  2018  from  $1.55 billion  in fiscal  2017 , 
representing  26% year -over -year growth. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue, to a lesser 
extent, was revenue associated with Magento’ s commerce platform offerings and Marketo’ s marketing cloud platform offerings. 
We expect that the addition of Marketo and Magento, and continued demand across our portfolio of Adobe Experience Cloud 
solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.
Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2018
• Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $6.83 billion  as of November 30, 2018  increased  by $1.44 billion , or 27%,

Digital Media
Revenue from Digital Media increased  $1.31 billion  during fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017 , primarily driven by 
increases in revenue associated with our Creative offerings. 
Revenue associated with our Creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetually licensed Creative and stock 
photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2018 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue across 
all of our Creative Cloud offerings driven by the increase in net new subscriptions. 
Adobe Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service, increased during 
fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to increases in subscriptions revenue driven by strong adoption of our  
Document Cloud.
Digital Experience
Revenue from Digital Experience increased  $413.4 million  during fiscal 2018 , as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due 
to subscription revenue growth associated with our Adobe Experience Cloud offerings. The increase in subscription revenue was 
primarily driven by continued adoption of our AEM offerings which is part of our Marketing Cloud and growth in revenue associated 
with our Analytics Cloud.  Also contributing to the increase in subscription revenue, but to a lesser extent, was revenue associated 
with our Magento Commerce Cloud and Advertising Cloud.

Fiscal 2018  Revenue by Geography Compar ed to Fiscal 2017  Revenue by Geography
Overall revenue during fiscal 2018  increased in all geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to increases 
in Digital Media and Digital Experience revenue. Within each geographic region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment 
were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. Further , the overall increase in EMEA  revenue during 
fiscal 2018 was positively impacted by the relative weakening of the U.S. Dollar against EMEA  currencies as discussed below .
Fiscal 2017  Revenue by Geography Compar ed to Fiscal 2016  Revenue by Geography
Overall revenue during fiscal 2017 increased in all geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases

During fiscal 2017, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the British Pound, which negatively impacted revenue in EMEA  
measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents. The net foreign currency impact to revenue was offset in part by hedging gains from our 
EMEA  and Japanese Yen currencies hedging programs during fiscal 2017.

Backlog
Deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue 
recognition for our products and solutions and does not represent the total contract value of existing annual or multi-year , non-
cancellable commercial subscription, SaaS and managed services agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. 
Unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings that are contractually committed under our existing subscription, 
SaaS and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial 
statements. Our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry . As of 
November 30, 2018 , we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog, including that of our fiscal 2018 acquisitions, of approximately 
$5.05 billion  of which approximately 40% to 50% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2019 . Comparatively , we 
had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.94 billion  as of December 1, 2017 , of which approximately 40% to 
50% was not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2018 . 
We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, 
including the timing and duration of large customer subscriptions, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles 
of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes 
in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally , the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for 
multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior 
to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly , fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog 
may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.

Cost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, 
including depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and 
related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of 
certain intangible assets and allocated overhead. We enter into contracts with third parties for hosting services and use of data 
center facilities. Our data center costs largely consist of the amounts we pay to these third parties for rack space, power and similar 
items. Cost of subscription revenue also includes media costs related to impressions purchased from third-party ad inventory

marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public 
relations and other market development programs.

Amortization of Pur chased Intangibles
During the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. As a result of 
these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to 
fourteen  years.
Amortization expense increased during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to 
amortization of intangible assets purchased through our acquisitions of Magento and Marketo in the third and fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2018, respectively , and partially offset by certain fully amortized acquired intangible assets from previous acquisitions. We 
expect that intangible assets purchased through our acquisitions of Magento and Marketo will continue to increase our amortization 
expense in future periods.
Amortization expense remained relatively consistent during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.  The decreases associated 
with certain fully amortized acquired intangible assets from previous acquisitions were offset by increases associated with intangible 
assets purchased through our acquisition of TubeMogul in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed 
income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and 
foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.
Interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 due to higher average invested 
balances and interest rates and a decline in foreign exchange hedging costs. 
Inter est Expense
Interest expense primarily represents interest associated with our term loan, senior notes and interest rate swaps.  In October 
2018, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $2.25 billion  senior unsecured term loan for the purpose of partially 
funding the purchase price for our acquisition of Marketo. Interest on our Term Loan is payable periodically at the end of each 
interest period, whereas interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually , in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating 
interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly . The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-
annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments.  See Notes 5 and 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
for further details regarding our interest rate swaps and debt, respectively . 
Interest expense increased  during fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to higher short-term floating interest 
rates on interest rate swaps and higher average debt balances.
Investment Gains (Losses), Net
Investment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred

Percentage of total revenue 2% 6% 5%   
Effective tax rate 7% 21% 19%   
Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately 14 percentage points during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.  The 
lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the effects of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017 and a change to our corporate 
tax structure from which we serve our foreign customers that provided us the ability to deduct more expenses against our earnings 
in the U.S.
Our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.  
The increase was partially related to a one-time tax cost associated with licensing acquired company assets to our trading 
subsidiaries, offset in part by the recognition of excess tax benefits due to our adoption of new accounting guidance related to 
Table of Contents
48stock-based compensation and the completion of certain income tax examinations. In addition to the above noted items, the effective 
tax rate for fiscal 2016 included tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations, and to 
a lesser extent, a one-time tax benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of the fiscal 2015 U.S. Research and Development 
credit.
The above noted Tax Act transitions the U.S. tax system to a new territorial system and lowers the statutory corporate tax 
rate from 35% to 21%. Reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 21% became effective on January 1, 2018. In fiscal 
2018, our statutory federal corporate tax rate is a blended rate of 22.2%, which will be reduced to 21% in fiscal 2019 and thereafter . 
During fiscal 2018, we recorded tax charges for the impact of the Tax Act effects using the current available information 
and technical guidance on the interpretations of the Tax Act. As permitted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, Income Tax 
Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we recorded provisional estimates and have subsequently finalized our 
accounting analysis based on the guidance, interpretations, and data available as of November 30, 2018. Adjustments made in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 upon finalization of our accounting analysis were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
As a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, we remeasured our deferred taxes and recorded a tax charge 
of $10 million based on the tax rate that is expected to apply when such deferred taxes are settled or realized in future periods. To 
calculate the remeasurement of deferred taxes, we estimated when the existing deferred taxes will be settled or realized.
As part of the adoption of a new territorial tax system we recorded a transition tax expense of $176 million on deferred 
foreign earnings, long-term income taxes payable of $504 million, other tax liabilities of $19 million, and a reduction in our 
deferred tax liabilities of $347 million.  We intend to elect to pay the federal transition tax over a period of eight years as permitted 
by the Tax Act. As a result, we reclassified $40 million from long-term income taxes payable to short-term income taxes payable 
for the first installment payment due in fiscal 2019. 
We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant 
portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. As part of the adoption of a territorial 
tax system, the Tax Act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made 
after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. As we repatriate the undistributed earnings of our 
foreign subsidiaries for use in the U.S., the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax.
See Note 9 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
The gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $196.2 million , $172.9 million and 
$178.4 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively . If the total unrecognized tax benefits at November 30, 2018, December 
1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 were recognized, $145.2 million , $135.0 million and $144.5 million would decrease the respective 
effective tax rates, which were net of estimated $51.0 million , $37.9 million, and $33.9 million federal benefits related to deducting 
certain payments on future federal and state tax returns for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively .
The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately 
$24.6 million  and $23.6 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively . These amounts were included in long-term income taxes 
payable in their respective years.
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments 
that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of short-term and long-
term assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either 
certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the 
uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential effect in underlying unrecognized tax benefits 
ranging from $0 to approximately $45 million .

general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other uses of cash include business 
acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. 
Cash Flows fr om Operating Activities
For fiscal 2018 , net cash provided by operating activities of $4.03 billion  was primarily comprised of net income plus the 
net effect of non-cash items, including adjustments to deferred income taxes related to the Tax Act. The primary working capital 
sources of cash were net income coupled with increases to taxes payable and deferred revenue. The increase in income taxes 
payable was primarily driven by the one-time transition tax recorded pursuant to the Tax Act. The increase in deferred revenue 
was principally due to increases in Digital Media site and term licenses and from our acquisition of Magento and Marketo in the 
third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018, respectively . The primary working capital use of cash was the increase in prepaid expenses 
driven by the timing of billings and payments of maintenance and support services associated with our licensed technologies and 
increases in prepaid insurance.
For fiscal 2017 , net cash provided by operating activities of $2.91 billion  was primarily comprised of net income plus the 
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred 
revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative 
Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Experience hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the 
increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by headcount growth, and increased accrued media costs 
associated with our Advertising Cloud offerings, including TubeMogul. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases 
in trade receivables, payments of trade payables assumed as part of the TubeMogul acquisition, and a decrease in income taxes 
payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to revenue linearity , higher revenue levels, and increased media receivables 
attributable to TubeMogul. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to taxes paid in excess of the tax provision increase. 
For fiscal 2016 , net cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion  was primarily comprised of net income plus the 
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred 
revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative 
Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Experience hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the 
increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by the increase in headcount. The primary working 
capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a decrease in income taxes 
payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to higher revenue levels. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased 
primarily due to advanced tax payments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due 
to the completion of certain income tax audits in fiscal 2016, offset in part by increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid.

50Cash Flows from Investing Activities
For fiscal 2018 , net cash used for investing activities of $4.69 billion  was primarily due to our acquisitions of Magento and 
Marketo during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively . Other uses of cash included purchases of property and 
equipment and short-term investments. These cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-
term investments.
For fiscal 2017 , net cash used for investing activities of $442.9 million  was primarily due to purchases of short-term 
investments and our acquisition of TubeMogul. Other uses of cash included purchases of property and equipment, including the 
Almaden Tower and long-term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of 
short-term investments.  
For fiscal 2016 , net cash used for investing activities of $960.0 million  was primarily due to purchases of short-term 
investments. Other uses of cash represented purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other 
assets, and an immaterial acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments. 
See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
For fiscal 2018, net cash used for financing activities was $5.6 million . Primary uses of cash were payments made for our 
treasury stock repurchases and taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.  These were offset by the proceeds of our  
$2.25 billion  senior unsecured term loan (the “Term Loan”) which partially funded our acquisition of Marketo.  Funds were received 
net of issuance costs on October 31, 2018 upon closing of the acquisition. The Term Loan will mature 18 months following the 
initial funding date. 
For fiscal 2017 , net cash used for financing activities of $1.18 billion  was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock 
repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock.
For fiscal 2016 , net cash used for financing activities of $1.09 billion  was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock 
repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock 
and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions.
See the section titled “Stock Repur chase Program” discussed below .
We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities 
expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and 
administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to 
strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. 
Other  Liquidity and Capital Resour ces Considerations
Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2019  due to changes in our planned 
cash outlay , including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. 
Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed 
in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” However , based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our 
existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility 
will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. 
On October 17, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, 
providing for a five-year $1 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility , which replaces our previous five-year $1 billion  
senior unsecured revolving credit agreement dated as of March 2, 2012. The new credit agreement continues to provide for loans 
to us and certain of our subsidiaries through October 17, 2023.  As of November 30, 2018 , there were no outstanding borrowings 
under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. 
As of November 30, 2018 , we have a $2.25 billion  Term Loan outstanding due April 30, 2020. As of November 30, 2018 , 
the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion , consisting of $900 million  of 4.75% senior notes due February 
1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $1 billion  of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes,” and together with the 
2020 Notes, the “Notes”).  The Notes and Term Loan rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

51Subsequent to November 30, 2018 , we acquired the remaining interest in Allegorithmic for approximately  $105.0 million  in 
cash consideration. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our 
acquisition of Allegorithmic.
Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate debt securities, U.S. Treasury securities, foreign 
government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities. We use professional investment management firms to 
manage a large portion of our invested cash.
Stock Repur chase Program
To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock 
issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In 
January 2017, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 billion
in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. In May 2018, our Board of Directors granted us additional authority to repurchase 
up to $8.0 billion  in common stock through the end of fiscal 2021.
During fiscal 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial 
institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $2.05 billion , $1.10 billion , and $1.08 billion , respectively . 
We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted 
Average Price (“VW AP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the 
discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial 
institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there 
is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used 
to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the 
contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon 
discount. 
The following is a summary of our stock repurchases executed with large financial institutions during fiscal 2018, 2017 
and 2016 (in thousands, except average per share amounts) :

Total cost $2,001,500 $1,098,595 $1,013,131
For fiscal 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at 
the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 30, 2018 , December 1, 2017  and December 2, 2016
were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 30, 2018 , $150.0 million  of prepayments from our 
May 2018 authority remained under the agreement. 
Subsequent to November 30, 2018 , as part of the $8 billion  stock repurchase authority , we entered into a structured stock 
repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $500 million . This 
amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $500 million  stock 
repurchase agreement, $7.35 billion  remains under our May 2018 authority . As of November 30, 2018, there is no remaining 
balance under our January 2017 authority .  
See Item 5, Market for Registrant’ s Common Equity , Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 30, 2018.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggr egate Contractual Obligations
 Our principal commitments as of November 30, 2018  consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements 
and various service agreements. See Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding 
our contractual commitments.
Table of Contents
52Transition Taxes Liability
As a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, all historical undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings were 
subject to a mandatory one-time transition tax. During fiscal 2018, we recorded a transition tax liability of $504 million and other 
tax liabilities, including state, of $6 million. Under an election of the Tax Act, the transition tax is payable over eight years beginning 
in fiscal 2019, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. As we 
repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the U.S., the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries will 
generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax. We continuously evaluate the future cash needs of our global operations to determine 
the amount of foreign earnings that is not necessary to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 30, 2018  (in millions):
    Payment Due by Period

Notes and Term Loan, including interest $4,538.5 $ 153.3 $ 3,271.2 $ 65.0 $ 1,049.0

Total $5,938.8 $ 579.0 $ 3,762.6 $ 232.3 $ 1,364.9
Term Loan
As of November 30, 2018, our Term Loan’ s carrying value was $2.25 billion . At our election, the Term Loan will bear 
interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500%
to 1.000%  or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040%  to 0.110%. Interest is payable periodically , 
in arrears, at the end of each interest period we elect. Based on the LIBOR rate at November 30, 2018, our estimated maximum 
commitment for interest payments was $112.8 million  for the remaining duration of the Term Loan.
Senior Notes
As of November 30, 2018 , our outstanding Notes payable consist of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes with a total carrying 
value of $1.88 billion .  Interest on our Notes is payable semi-annually , in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At November 30, 
2018 , our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $275.4 million  for the remaining duration of our 
Notes. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a 
floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020.
Covenants
Our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement contain similar financial covenants requiring us not to exceed a maximum 
leverage ratio. As of November 30, 2018 , we were in compliance with the covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact 
our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any 
financial covenants. 
Under the terms of our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends 
unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the 
foreseeable future.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
See Results of Operations - Provision for Income Taxes above for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income 
taxes.
Royalties
We have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is 
generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold, or a percentage of the underlying revenue.
Table of Contents
53Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual 
property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of  our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims 
by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically , costs related to these indemnification provisions have not 
been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future 
results of operations.
To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for 
certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity . The indemnification 
period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director ’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of 
future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however , we have director 
and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. 
ITEM 7A.  QUANTIT ATIVE AND QUALIT ATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT  MARKET  RISK
All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.
Foreign Curr ency Risk
Foreign Curr ency Exposur es and Hedging Instruments
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us 
to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge 
our foreign currency revenue. Additionally , we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign 
exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected 
by changes in exchange rates. 
Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2018 , 2017  and 2016  were as follows (in millions, except 
Japanese Yen):
Fiscal
2018Fiscal
2017Fiscal
2016
Euro € 1,309.9 € 1,044.7 € 825.6
Japanese Yen (in billions) ¥ 60.8 ¥ 51.0 ¥ 38.7
British Pounds £ 423.1 £ 338.4 £ 263.5
As of November 30, 2018 , the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and 
forwards, was $1.55 billion , which included the notional equivalent of $805.0 million  in Euros, $275.3 million  in British Pounds, 
$331.8 million  in Japanese Yen and $140.3 million  in other foreign currencies. As of November 30, 2018 , all contracts were set 
to expire at various dates through June 2019. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses 
that would be largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the 
net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting 
arrangements that have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement 
transactions.
A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 30, 2018 . This sensitivity 
analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. 
Dollar . For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and 
a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our 
financial hedging instruments by $48.2 million . Conversely , a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a 
decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $60.7 million .
As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in 
countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the 
local currency denominated operating expenses. 
We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar 
functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 30, 2018  and December 1, 2017 , this long-term investment exposure 
Table of Contents
54totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $292.3 million  and $190.5 million , respectively , with the year-over -year increase primarily 
driven by earnings growth. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.
We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure 
in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and 
assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.
Cash Flow Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Curr ency Revenue 
We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in 
Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen.  We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows 
will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities 
between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course 
of business and accordingly , they are not speculative in nature.
We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until 
the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow 
hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur , or it becomes probable that it will not occur , 
we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and 
other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018 , there 
were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur .
Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Curr ency Assets and Liabilities
We hedge exposures related to our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward 
contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, 
net. These foreign exchange contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because 
gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 30, 
2018 , the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.
See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.
Inter est Rate Risk
Short-T erm Investments and Fixed Income Securities
At November 30, 2018 , we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.59 billion . Changes in interest 
rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated 
maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions):
Due within one year $ 612.1
Due between one and two years 564.2
Due between two and three years 282.2
Due after three years 127.7
Total $ 1,586.2
A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 30, 2018 . The analysis is based on an 
estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield 
curve of various magnitudes.
Table of Contents
55The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming 
immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS.  The analysis is shown as of 
November 30, 2018  and December 1, 2017  (dollars in millions):
-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPSFair Value
11/30/18 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS
$ 1,617.5 $ 1,607.1 $ 1,596.6 $ 1,586.2 $ 1,575.7 $ 1,565.3 $ 1,554.8
-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPSFair Value
12/1/17 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS
$ 3,595.2 $ 3,568.1 $ 3,540.9 $ 3,513.7 $ 3,486.5 $ 3,459.3 $ 3,432.1
Term Loan 
As of November 30, 2018 , our Term Loan’ s carrying value was $2.25 billion . At our election, the Term Loan will bear 
interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500%  to 1.000%  or (ii) a base rate plus a 
margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040%  to 0.110%. Interest is payable periodically , in arrears, at the end of each 
interest period we elect.  An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have 
a significant impact on our results of operations.
Senior Notes
As of November 30, 2018 , the amount outstanding under our Notes was $1.9 billion . In June 2014, we entered into interest 
rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a 
fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly , our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is on the 
hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million . An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates 
would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.
As of November 30, 2018 , the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.88 billion  and the related fair value based on  
observable market prices in less active markets was $1.89 billion .
Other  Market Risk
Privately Held Long-T erm Investments
The privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are 
inherently risky . The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may 
never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of 
privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure 
regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy 
of the data received from these companies. We have immaterial exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies 
as these investments were not significant as of November 30, 2018  and December 1, 2017 .

NOTE 1.  BASIS OF  PRESENT ATION AND SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Operations
Founded in 1982, Adobe Inc. is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of 
products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, enterprises and 
consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and experiences across 
personal computers, devices and media. We market and license our products and services directly to enterprise customers through 
our sales force and to end users through app stores and our own website at www .adobe.com. We offer many of our products via 
a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as a hosted or cloud-based) 
as well as through term subscription and pay-per -use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network 
of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers, 
software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to hardware 
manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on personal 
and server -based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations 
in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“AP AC”). 
Basis of Pr esentation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all 
intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations 
of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Use of Estimates
In preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP  and pursuant to the rules 
and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stock-
based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, excess inventory and purchase 
commitments, facilities lease losses, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, litigation, income taxes and investments. Actual 
results may differ materially from these estimates.
Fiscal Y ear
Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Our financial results for fiscal 
2016 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to our 52/53-week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2016 
was a 53-week fiscal year compared with fiscal 2018  and 2017 which were 52-week fiscal years.
Reclassifications
Certain immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows. 
Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue is derived from subscription offerings, non-software related hosted services, term-based and perpetual licensing 
of software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training, and technical support. 
Most of our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with 
post-contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer . 
We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. 
Table of Contents
ADOBE INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
63Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have 
a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. 
Multiple Element Arrangements
We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, 
maintenance and support, hosted services, and consulting.
For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered 
products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor -specific objective evidence (“VSOE”); 
and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the 
undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, 
revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements 
of the arrangement have been delivered. However , if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire 
arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements 
in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
We determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate 
for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling 
prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, 
consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses. 
For multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each 
element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, 
third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total 
price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.
For multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software 
or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy . We determine 
the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE 
of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP . Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, 
we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition 
criteria are met for each element.
We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP . BESP  is generally 
used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP  
for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to major product groupings, geographies, market 
conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into 
consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate 
certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make 
reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly , our assumptions and judgments 
regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially 
impacting our financial position and results of operations.
Subscription and Services and Support Revenue
We recognize revenue for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions, ratably beginning 
on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through 
the end of the contractual service term. Over -usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which 
we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced 
in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether all revenue recognition criteria have been met.

ADOBE INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
64Our services and support revenue is composed of consulting, training, and maintenance and support, primarily related to 
the licensing of our enterprise, mobile and device products and solutions. Our support revenue also includes technical support and 
developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products.
Our consulting revenue is recognized using a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, 
such as hours incurred to date, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones when applicable. 
Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements on a when 
and if available basis or technical support, depending on the offering, are recognized ratably over the performance period of the 
arrangement.
Our software subscription offerings, which may include product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available 
basis, hosted services, and online storage, are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize 
revenue associated with these arrangements ratably over the subscription period.
Product Revenue
We recognize our product revenue upon shipment, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our desktop 
application product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return, rebates and price protection. 
Our direct sales and OEM sales are also subject to limited rights of return. Accordingly , we reduce revenue recognized for estimated 
future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. The estimates for returns are adjusted 
periodically based upon historical rates of returns, inventory levels in the distribution channel and other related factors.
We recognize OEM licensing revenue, primarily royalties, when OEMs ship products incorporating our software, provided 
collection of such revenue is deemed probable. For certain OEM customers, we must estimate royalty revenue due to the timing 
of securing customer information. This estimate is based on a combination of our generated forecasts and actual historical reporting 
by our OEM customers. To substantiate our ability to estimate revenue, we review license royalty revenue reports ultimately 
received from our significant OEM customers in comparison to the amounts estimated in the prior period.
Our product-related deferred revenue includes maintenance upgrade revenue and customer advances under OEM license 
agreements. Our maintenance upgrade revenue for our desktop application products is included in our product revenue line item 
as the maintenance primarily entitles customers to receive product upgrades. In cases where we provide a specified free upgrade 
to an existing product, we defer the fair value for the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the 
right to the specified free upgrade expires.
Rights of Return, Rebates and Price Pr otection
As discussed above, we offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies 
and programs with our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. We estimate and record reserves for these programs as 
an offset to revenue and accounts receivable. Below is a summary of each of the general provisions in our contracts:
• Distributors are allowed limited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter . In addition, distributors 
are allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and products that are being 
replaced by new versions.
• We offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end user customers. The amount of revenue that is reduced for 
distributor and reseller rebates is based on actual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting 
period (volume, timely reporting, etc.). If mail-in or other promotional rebates are offered, the amount of revenue reduced 
is based on the dollar amount of the rebate, taking into consideration an estimated redemption rate calculated using 
historical trends.
• From time to time, we may offer price protection to our distributors that allow for the right to a credit if we permanently 
reduce the price of a software product. The amount of revenue that is reduced for price protection is calculated as the 
difference between the old and new price of a software product on inventory held by the distributor immediately prior to 
the effective date of the decrease.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
65Although our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to cancel 
their contracts by providing prior written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term. In the event a 
customer cancels its contract, they are not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them.
On a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved for future returns is calculated based on our historical trends 
and data specific to each reporting period. We review the actual returns evidenced in prior quarters as a percent of revenue to 
determine a historical returns rate. We then apply the historical rate to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future 
returns. When necessary , we also provide a specific returns reserve for product in the distribution channel in excess of estimated 
requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product 
plans and other factors.

Deferr ed Revenue
 Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and solutions 
described above. We recognize deferred revenue as revenue only when the revenue recognition criteria are met.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables. 
The allowance is based on both specific and general reserves. We regularly review our trade receivables allowances by considering 
such factors as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances and current economic conditions 
that may affect a customer ’s ability to pay and we specifically reserve for those deemed uncollectible.

Property and Equipment
We record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are 
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 5 years for computers and equipment 
as well as server hardware under capital leases, 1 to 6 years for furniture and fixtures, 5 to 20 years for building improvements 
and up to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the 
remaining respective lease term or estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 15 years.

66Goodwill, Pur chased Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting segments on the date of acquisition. We review our goodwill for impairment 
annually during our second quarter of each fiscal year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that 
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any one of our reporting units below its respective carrying amount. In performing 
our goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative assessment, which requires that we consider events or circumstances 
including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in 
management or key personnel, changes in strategy , changes in customers, changes in the composition or carrying amount of a 
reporting segment’ s net assets and changes in our stock price. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine 
that it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting segments are greater than the carrying amounts, then the quantitative 
goodwill impairment test is not performed.
If the qualitative assessment indicates that the quantitative analysis should be performed, we then evaluate goodwill for 
impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting segments to its carrying value, including the associated goodwill. 
To determine the fair values, we use the equal weighting of the market approach based on comparable publicly traded companies 
in similar lines of businesses and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Our cash flow assumptions 
consider historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors.
We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 . We determined, after performing 
a qualitative review of each reporting segment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting segments 
substantially exceeds the respective carrying amounts. Accordingly , there was no indication of impairment and the quantitative 
goodwill impairment test was not performed. We did not identify any events or changes in circumstances since the performance 
of our annual goodwill impairment test that would require us to perform another goodwill impairment test during the fiscal year.
We amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever 
an impairment indicator exists. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts 
of our long-lived assets, including our intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances 
occur , we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted 
expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize 
an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We did not recognize any intangible 
asset impairment charges in fiscal 2018 , 2017  or 2016 .
During fiscal 2018 , our intangible assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 14 years. 
Amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line 
basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent. The weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets were as follows:
 Weighted 
Average
Useful Life 
(years )
Purchased technology 6
Customer contracts and relationships 9
Trademarks 9
Acquired rights to use technology 10
Backlog 2
Other intangibles 4 
Income T axes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized 
for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, 
and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount 
for which realization is more likely than not.

67Taxes Collected from Customers
We net taxes collected from customers against those remitted to government authorities in our financial statements. 
Accordingly , taxes collected from customers are not reported as revenue.
Treasury Stock
We account for treasury stock under the cost method. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price higher than its cost, the 
difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treasury stock is 
re-issued at a price lower than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital to the extent that 
there are previously recorded gains to offset the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in-capital, the losses 
upon re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2018 , 2017  and 2016  were $173.6 million , 
$141.7 million  and $135.8 million , respectively .
Foreign Curr ency T ranslation
We translate assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is their local currency , at exchange 
rates in effect at the balance sheet date. We translate revenue and expenses at the monthly average exchange rates. We include 
accumulated net translation adjustments in stockholders’  equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
(loss).
Foreign Curr ency and Other Hedging Instruments
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use 
foreign exchange option and forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue primarily 
in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign 
exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange 
rates. 
We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them 
at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and 
whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to fair 
value through earnings. See Note 5 for information regarding our hedging activities.
Gains and losses from foreign exchange forward contracts which hedge certain balance sheet positions are recorded each 
period as a component of interest and other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Foreign exchange option 
contracts hedging forecasted foreign currency revenue are designated as cash flow hedges with gains and losses recorded net of 
tax, as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders’  equity and reclassified into revenue at the time the forecasted 
transactions occur .
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are short-term fixed-income investments, 
structured repurchase transactions, foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts and trade receivables.
Our investment portfolio consists of investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries and issuers. 
Our cash and investments are held and primarily managed by recognized financial institutions that follow our investment policy . 
Our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one security issue or issuer and we believe no significant concentration of 
credit risk exists with respect to these investments.
We enter into foreign currency hedge contracts with bank counterparties that could expose us to credit related losses in the 
event of their nonperformance. This is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received 
or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, 
Table of Contents
ADOBE INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
68we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit related losses with the same counterparty 
by permitting net settlement transactions. 
The aggregate fair value of foreign currency contracts in net asset positions as of November 30, 2018  and December 1, 
2017  was $44.3 million  and $14.2 million  respectively . These amounts represent the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting 
date as a result of all of the counterparties failing to perform as contracted. These exposures could be reduced by certain immaterial 
liabilities included in master netting arrangements with those same counterparties. 
Credit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market, 
customers to whom we license software directly and our SaaS offerings. A credit review is completed for our new distributors, 
dealers and OEMs. We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’  financial condition and require letters of credit 
or other guarantees, whenever deemed necessary . The credit limit given to the customer is based on our risk assessment of their 
ability to pay, country risk and other factors and is not contingent on the resale of the product or on the collection of payments 
from their customers. If we license our software or provide SaaS services to a customer where we have a reason to believe the 
customer ’s ability to pay is not probable, due to country risk or credit risk, we will not recognize the revenue. We will revert to 
recognizing the revenue on a cash basis, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition has been met.
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance 
On January 26, 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 
2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which eliminated step two from the goodwill impairment test. In assessing 
impairment of goodwill, if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reportable segment exceeds 
its fair value during the qualitative assessment, a one-step goodwill impairment test will be performed. If it is concluded during 
the quantitative test that the carrying amount of a reportable segment exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized 
in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reportable segment. The effective date 
of the new standard for public companies is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those 
fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
In the first quarter of 2018, we early adopted ASU 2017-04. The standard did not have an impact to our qualitative assessment 
for goodwill impairment that we performed in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
There have been no other new accounting pronouncements made effective during fiscal 2018 that have significance, or 
potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective
On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to 
recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The 
updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP  when it becomes effective and permits the 
use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. The updated standard is effective for us in the first 
quarter of fiscal 2019. We will adopt this updated standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a modified retrospective basis. We 
are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related 
disclosures.
While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the new standard, we believe there should not be a material change 
to the amount of consolidated revenues on an annual basis.
We expect revenue related to our cloud offerings, including Creative Cloud and Document Cloud for business enterprises, 
individuals and teams, to remain substantially unchanged. When sold with cloud-enabled services, Creative Cloud and Document 
Cloud require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered 
distinct. Revenue for these offerings will continue to be recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.
We believe the most significant revenue-related impact relates to our accounting for arrangements that include on-premise 
term-based software licenses bundled with maintenance and support. Under current GAAP , the revenue attributable to these 
software licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement because VSOE does not exist for the undelivered 
Table of Contents
ADOBE INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
69maintenance and support element as it is not sold separately . The requirement to have VSOE for undelivered elements to enable 
the separation of revenue for the delivered software licenses is eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly , under the new 
standard we will be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the arrangement fee upon delivery of the software licenses and 
potentially classify such revenue as “product” instead of “subscription” revenue on the income statement. We offer on-premise 
term-based software licenses bundled with maintenance and support as a deployment model for certain offerings within our Digital 
Experience, Digital Media, and Publishing business units. We do not expect these arrangements to have a material impact to 
revenue reported in annual reporting periods subsequent to adoption, however they may result in a material balance sheet impact 
on the date of adoption due to the application of the modified retrospective transition method. The modified retrospective method 
requires upon adoption that we recognize the impact of applying the new standard to contracts that are not completed at the date 
of initial adoption, but under this adoption method, we do not restate prior financial statements. We will record a cumulative effect 
of initially applying the provisions of the new standard as an adjustment to increase the opening retained earnings balance and 
reduce the opening deferred revenue balance. Further , some of our enterprise agreements allow our customers to commit to prepaid 
bank of funds which can be utilized to purchase Adobe products or services, which includes customer option to purchase or renew 
on-premise term-based licenses on a monthly basis. Revenue associated with these term-license performance obligations would 
be recognized monthly . 
Other expected impacts to our policies and disclosures include: earlier recognition of revenue for certain contracts due to 
the elimination of contingent revenue limitations, an unbilled receivable balance on our balance sheets, the requirement to estimate 
variable consideration for certain arrangements, increased allocation of revenue to and from professional services and other 
offerings, and changes to our financial statement disclosures such as remaining performance obligations.
Under current GAAP , we expense costs related to the acquisition of revenue-generating contracts as incurred. Under the 
new standard, we will be required to capitalize certain costs incremental to contract acquisition and amortize them over the expected 
period of benefit. We expect there will be a material balance sheet impact at the period of adoption to capitalize costs of obtaining 
the contract as an asset, with a corresponding adjustment to opening retained earnings at the date of initial adoption. Additionally , 
we may have to record related deferred income taxes. We continue to evaluate the magnitude of the impact and the impact recent 
acquisitions will have under current standards and the new standard.
Due to the complexity of certain of our contracts, the actual accounting treatment required under the new standard for these 
arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and therefore may vary in some instances.
On February 24, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and 
a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of short-term leases with a lease term of twelve months or 
less. For lessees, leases will continue to be classified as either operating or finance leases in the income statement. Lessor accounting 
is similar to the current model but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model. Lessors will continue to classify 
leases as operating, direct financing or sales-type leases. The effective date of the new leases standard for public companies is for 
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The 
updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and we do not plan to early adopt.
The new leases standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and allows for the application of the 
new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or at the adoption date. In July 2018, the FASB issued 
ASU No. 2018-1 1, Leases - Targeted Improvements, providing an optional transition method that allows entities to initially apply 
the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-ef fect adjustment to the opening balance of retained 
earnings in the period of adoption. We intend to adopt the new leases standard using this optional transition method.
While we are continuing to assess the potential impacts of the standard, we currently expect the most significant impact 
will be the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We are implementing a new 
lease accounting system and updating our processes in preparation for the adoption of the new leases standard.
On August 28, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging, requiring expanded hedge accounting 
for both non-financial and financial risk components and refining the measurement of hedge results to better reflect an entity's 
hedging strategies. For example, adoption would result in reclassification of hedge costs from foreign currency hedges from interest 
and other income (expense), net to revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The updated standard also amends the 
presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how entities assess hedge effectiveness. The effective date of the new

70standard for public companies is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. 
Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition with a cumulative effect 
adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings as of the initial adoption date. The updated standard is effective for us beginning 
in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our Consolidated 
Financial Statements and related disclosures. While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the new standard, we 
believe there should not be a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
With the exception of the new standards discussed above, there have been no other new accounting pronouncements that 
have significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
NOTE 2.   ACQUISITIONS
Marketo
On October 31, 2018 , we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company , for 
approximately  $4.74 billion  of cash consideration. Adding Marketo’ s engagement platform to Adobe Experience Cloud furthers 
our long-term plan for strategic growth in the Digital Experience segment and enables us to offer a comprehensive set of solutions 
to enable customers across industries and companies automate and orchestrate their marketing activities. Under the terms of the 
Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of 
Milestone Topco, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Topco”) and indirect parent company of Marketo, and other equity interests in 
Marketo. In connection with the acquisition, each Marketo equity award that was issued and outstanding was cancelled and 
extinguished in exchange for cash consideration. Also pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon closing of the transaction, cash 
was paid for the settlement of Marketo’ s long-term incentive plan, the settlement of Marketo’ s indebtedness and the acquisition 
of all remaining equity interests in Marketo K.K., a Japanese corporation and joint venture. 
In connection with the acquisition of Marketo, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $2.25 billion  senior 
unsecured term loan (the “Term Loan”). The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to (i) fund a portion of the purchase price of 
the acquisition and (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition. The Term Loan funds were received 
on October 31, 2018 upon closing of the acquisition and will mature 18 months  following the initial funding date. See Note 15 for 
further details regarding our debt.
Following the closing, we began integrating Marketo into our Digital Experience reportable segment. We have included 
the financial results of Marketo in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on the acquisition date. The amounts of net 
revenue and net loss of Marketo included in the Company’ s Consolidated Statements of Income from the acquisition date through 
November 30, 2018  were not material. The direct transaction costs associated with the acquisition were also not material.
Purchase Price Allocation
Under the purchase accounting method, the total preliminary purchase price was allocated to Marketo’ s net tangible and 
intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the 
net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill.

71The table below represents the preliminary purchase price allocation to the acquired net tangible and intangible assets of 
Marketo based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date and the associated estimated useful lives at that date. The

the reporting date and are considered preliminary pending finalization of valuation analyses pertaining to intangible assets acquired, 
deferred revenue and tax liabilities assumed including the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

_________________________________________
(1) Non-deductible for tax-purposes.
Identifiable intangible assets —Customer relationships consist of Marketo’ s contractual relationships and customer loyalty 
related to their enterprise and commercial customers as well as technology partner relationships. The estimated fair value of the 
customer contracts and relationships was determined based on projected cash flows attributable to the asset. Purchased technology 
acquired primarily consists of Marketo’ s cloud-based engagement marketing software platform.  The estimated fair value of the 
purchased technology was determined based on the expected future cost savings resulting from ownership of the asset. Backlog 
relates to subscription contracts and professional services. Non-compete agreements include agreements with key Marketo 
employees that preclude them from competing against Marketo for a period of two years from the acquisition date.  Trademarks 
include the Marketo trade name, which is well known in the marketing ecosystem. We amortize the fair value of these intangible 
assets on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.
Goodwill —Approximately $3.46 billion  has been allocated to goodwill, and has been allocated in full to the Digital 
Experience reportable segment. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying acquired 
net tangible and intangible assets. The factors that contributed to the recognition of goodwill included securing buyer -specific 
syner gies that increase revenue and profits and are not otherwise available to a marketplace participant, acquiring a talented 
workforce and cost savings opportunities. 
Net liabilities assumed —Marketo’ s tangible assets and liabilities as of October 31, 2018 were reviewed and adjusted to 
their fair value as necessary . The net liabilities assumed included, among other items, $100.1 million  in accrued expenses, $74.8 
million  in deferred revenue and $182.6 million  in deferred tax liabilities, which were partially offset by $54.9 million  in cash and 
cash equivalents and $72.4 million  in trade receivables acquired.
Deferr ed revenue —Included in net liabilities assumed is Marketo’ s deferred revenue which represents advance payments 
from customers related to subscription contracts and professional services. We estimated our obligation related to the deferred 
revenue using the cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the direct and indirect 
costs related to supporting the obligation plus an assumed operating margin. The sum of the costs and assumed operating profit 
approximates, in theory , the amount that Marketo would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation. The estimated 
costs to fulfill the obligation were based on the near-term projected cost structure for subscription and professional services. As a 
result, we recorded an adjustment to reduce Marketo’ s carrying value of deferred revenue to $74.8 million , which represents our 
estimate of the fair value of the contractual obligations assumed based on a preliminary valuation.
Table of Contents
ADOBE INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
72Taxes—As part of our accounting for the Marketo acquisition, a portion of the overall purchase price was allocated to 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is not deductible for tax 
purposes. Thus, approximately $348.8 million , included in the net liabilities assumed, was established as a deferred tax liability 
for the future amortization of the intangible assets, and was partially offset by other tax assets of $166.2 million , which primarily 
consist of net operating loss carryforwards.
Any impairment charges made in the future associated with goodwill will not be tax deductible and will result in an increased 
effective income tax rate in the quarter the impairment is recorded.

TubeMogul
On December 19, 2016 , we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company . 
As of the end of fiscal 2018, we have integrated TubeMogul into our Digital Experience reportable segment. 
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul’ s net tangible and 
intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016 .  During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial 
purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management’ s estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, 
liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill. The total final purchase price for TubeMogul was $560.8 million  of which 
$348.4 million  was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million  to identifiable intangible assets 
and $99.3 million  to net assets acquired.
 Pro forma information has not been presented for the TubeMogul acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial 
Statements was not material.

We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not

Allegorithmic
Subsequent to November 30, 2018 , we acquired the remaining interest in Allegorithmic SAS (“Allegorithmic”), a privately 
held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, for approximately  $105.0 million  in cash 
consideration. The initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between 
the acquisition date and the issuance of these financial statements. Allegorithmic will be integrated into our Digital Media reportable 
segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
NOTE 3.  CASH, CASH EQUIV ALENTS AND SHOR T-TERM INVESTMENTS
Cash equivalents consist of instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. We classify 
all of our cash equivalents and short-term investments as “available-for -sale.” In general, these investments are free of trading 
restrictions. We carry these investments at fair value, based on quoted market prices or other readily available market information. 
Unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is reflected as 
a separate component of stockholders’  equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses are recognized when realized 
in our Consolidated Statements of Income. When we have determined that an other -than-temporary decline in fair value has 
occurred, the amount of the decline that is related to a credit loss is recognized in income. Gains and losses are determined using 
the specific identification method.

issuer and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the

76investment’ s amortized cost basis. If we believe that an other -than-temporary decline exists in one of these securities, we write 
down these investments to fair value. For debt securities, the portion of the write-down related to credit loss would be recorded 
to interest and other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Any portion not related to credit loss would be recorded 
to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders’  equity in our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. For equity securities, the write-down would be recorded to investment gains (losses), net in our 
Consolidated Statements of Income. During fiscal 2018  and 2017 , we did not consider any of our investments to be other -than-
temporarily impaired. During fiscal 2016 , we recorded immaterial other -than-temporary impairment losses associated with certain 
of our fixed income securities and wrote down the securities to fair value.

See Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments. 
Our fixed income available-for -sale debt securities consist of high quality , investment grade securities from diverse issuers 
with a weighted average credit rating of A+. We value these securities based on pricing from independent pricing vendors who 
use matrix pricing valuation techniques including market approach methodologies that model information generated by market 
transactions involving identical or comparable assets, as well as discounted cash flow methodologies. Inputs include quoted prices 
in active markets for identical assets or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly in determining 
fair value, including benchmark yields, issuer spreads off benchmark yields, interest rates and U.S. Treasury or swap curves. We 
therefore classify all of our fixed income available-for -sale securities as Level 2. We perform routine procedures such as comparing 
prices obtained from multiple independent sources to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded.

78The fair values of our money market mutual funds and time deposits are based on the closing price of these assets as of the 
reporting date. We classify our money market mutual funds and time deposits as Level 1. 
Our Level 2 over-the-counter foreign currency and interest rate swap derivatives are valued using pricing models and 
discounted cash flow methodologies based on observable foreign exchange and interest rate data at the measurement date.
Our deferred compensation plan assets consist of money market mutual funds and other mutual funds.
Assets and Liabilities Measur ed at Fair Value on a Nonr ecurring Basis
We also have direct investments in privately held companies accounted for under the cost and equity method, which are 
periodically assessed for other -than-temporary impairment. If we determine that an other -than-temporary impairment has occurred, 
we write down the investment to its fair value. We estimate fair value of our cost and equity method investments considering 
available information such as pricing in recent rounds of financing, current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent 
operational performance and any other readily available market data. During fiscal 2018  and 2017 , we determined there were no 
other -than-temporary impairments on our cost and equity method investments. During fiscal 2016 , we determined there were 
immaterial other -than-temporary impairments on certain of our cost method investments and wrote down the investments to fair 
value. 
The fair value of our senior notes was $1.89 billion  as of November 30, 2018 , based on observable market prices in less 
active markets and categorized as Level 2. See Note 15 for further details regarding our debt.
NOTE 5.  DERIV ATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Hedge Accounting and Hedging Pr ograms
We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets 
and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of 
the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively , and record any 
ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of 
Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness 
was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income 
(expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which 
are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value 
of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting 
arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement 
of transactions. 
Balance Sheet Hedging —Hedges of For eign Curr ency Assets and Liabilities
We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward 
contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. 
These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes 
in the fair value recorded to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts 
do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are 
intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. 
As of November 30, 2018 , total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were $427.9 million  which included the notional 
equivalent of $158.8 million  in Euros, $51.5 million  in British Pounds, $77.2 million  in Japanese Yen, $50.7 million  in Indian 
Rupees, and $89.7 million  in other foreign currencies. As of December 1, 2017 , total notional amounts of outstanding contracts 
were $333.9 million  which included the notional equivalent of $105.0 million  in Euros, $34.6 million  in British Pounds, $45.4 
Table of Contents
ADOBE INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
79million  in Japanese Yen, $78.0 million  in Indian Rupees, and $70.9 million  in other foreign currencies. At November 30, 2018
and December 1, 2017 , the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.
Cash Flow Hedging—Hedges of For ecasted For eign Curr ency Revenue
In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use 
foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain cash flow exposures resulting from changes in these 
foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months . 
We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue in the 
normal course of business and accordingly , they are not speculative in nature.
To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, 
and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in 
the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance 
Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on 
the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur , or it becomes probable that it 
will not occur , we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. If we do not elect hedge 
accounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are 
recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 
For fiscal 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted 
transactions that did not occur . 
Fair V alue Hedging—Hedges of Inter est Rate Risks
During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge related to our 
$900 million  of 4.75%  fixed interest rate senior notes due February 1, 2020  (the “2020 Notes”). In effect, the interest rate swaps 
convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). 
Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus a fixed number of basis points on 
the $900 million  notional amount through February 1, 2020. In exchange, we will receive 4.75%  fixed rate interest from the swap 
counterparties. See Note 15 for further details regarding our debt.
The interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and substantially offset the changes in fair value of the hedged 
portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market risk. Therefore, the gains and losses related to changes 
in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements 
of Income. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is reflected in other liabilities or other assets in our Consolidated Balance 
Sheets.
The fair value of derivative instruments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of November 30, 2018  and December 1,

84U.S. Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted into law, which significantly changes existing 
U.S. tax law and includes many provisions applicable to us, such as reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, imposing a one-
time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, and adopting a territorial tax system. The Tax Act reduced 
the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory 
tax rate is 22.2% . This is the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first month of fiscal 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21%
for the remaining eleven months of fiscal 2018. The Tax Act also required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign 
income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5%  for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8%
on the remaining income, in each case reduced by certain foreign tax credits. The Tax Act also includes a provision to tax global 
intangible low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries, a special tax deduction for foreign-derived intangible income, and a base 
erosion anti-abuse tax measure that may tax certain payments between a U.S. corporation and its subsidiaries. These additional 
provisions of the Tax Act will be effective for us beginning December 1, 2018.
During fiscal 2018, we recorded tax charges for the impact of the Tax Act effects using the current available information 
and technical guidance on the interpretations of the Tax Act. As permitted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, Income Tax 
Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we recorded provisional estimates and have subsequently finalized our 
accounting analysis based on the guidance, interpretations, and data available as of November 30, 2018. Adjustments made in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 upon finalization of our accounting analysis were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
As a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, we remeasured our deferred taxes and recorded a tax charge 
of $10 million  based on the tax rate that is expected to apply when such deferred taxes are settled or realized in future periods. To 
calculate the remeasurement of deferred taxes, we estimated when the existing deferred taxes will be settled or realized.
As part of the adoption of a new territorial tax system we recorded a transition tax expense of $176 million  on deferred 
foreign earnings, long-term income taxes payable of $504 million , other tax liabilities of $19 million , and a reduction in our 
deferred tax liabilities of $347 million . We intend to elect to pay the federal transition tax over a period of eight years as permitted 
by the Tax Act. As a result, we reclassified $40 million  from long-term income taxes payable to short-term income taxes payable 
for the first installment payment due in fiscal 2019. 
Certain international provisions introduced in the Tax Act will be effective for us in fiscal 2019. As part of these provisions, 
an accounting policy election is available to either account for the tax effects of certain taxes in the period that is subject to such 
taxes or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that upon reversal may be subject to such taxes. We elect to 
account for the tax effects of these provisions in the period that it is subject to such tax. Accordingly , we have not recorded any 
tax with respect to these provisions during fiscal 2018.

86certain states and foreign jurisdictions to fully utilize available tax credits and other attributes. The deferred tax assets are offset 
by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized.
We provide U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’  earnings are considered 
permanently reinvested outside the United States or are exempted from taxation as a result of the new territorial tax system. To 
the extent that the foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may 
be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. As of November 30, 2018 , the cumulative amount of earnings 
upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $275 million . The unrecognized deferred tax liability for 
these earnings is approximately $57.8 million .
As of November 30, 2018 , we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $881.1 million  for federal and $349.7 
million  for state. We also have federal, state and foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $8.8 million , $189.9 million  
and $14.9 million , respectively . The net operating loss carryforward assets and tax credits will expire in various years from fiscal 
2019  through 2036 . The state tax credit carryforwards and a portion of the federal net operating loss carryforwards can be carried 
forward indefinitely . The net operating loss carryforward assets and certain credits are reduced by the valuation allowance and 
are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, the carrying amount of which are expected to be 
fully realized.
As of November 30, 2018 , a valuation allowance of $174.5 million  has been established for certain deferred tax assets 
related to certain state and foreign assets. For fiscal 2018 , the total change in the valuation allowance was $80.9 million .
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
During fiscal 2018  and 2017 , our aggregate changes in our total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized 
as follows (in thousands):
  2018 2017
Beginning balance $172,945 $178,413
Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions 16,191 3,680
Gross decreases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions (4,000 ) (30,166 )
Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – current year tax positions 60,721 24,927
Settlements with taxing authorities — (3,876 )
Lapse of statute of limitations (45,922 ) (8,819 )
Foreign exchange gains and losses (3,783 ) 8,786
Ending balance $196,152 $172,945
The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately 
$24.6 million  and $23.6 million  for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively . These amounts were included in long-term income taxes 
payable in their respective years.
We file income tax returns in the United States on a federal basis and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. We are 
subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. Our 
major tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and the United States. For Ireland, California and the United States, the earliest 
fiscal years open for examination are 2008 , 2014  and 2015 , respectively . We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting 
from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments 
that may result from these examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however , there can be no assurance that the 
final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments 
that are part of any audit settlement process.  These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of short-term and long-
term assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either 
certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the 
uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential effect in underlying unrecognized tax benefits 
ranging from $0 to approximately $45 million .

87NOTE 10.  BENEFIT  PLANS
Retir ement Savings Plan
In 1987, we adopted an Employee Investment Plan, qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is 
a retirement savings plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees, now referred to as the Adobe 401(k) Retirement Savings 
Plan. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 65% of their pretax or after-tax salary , subject to the Internal Revenue 
Service annual contribution limits. In fiscal 2018 , we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employee’ s eligible compensation. We 
contributed $41.0 million , $34.3 million  and $33.4 million  in fiscal 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , respectively . We are under no obligation 
to continue matching future employee contributions and, at our discretion, may change our practices at any time.
Deferr ed Compensation Plan
On September 21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the Adobe Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, effective December 2, 
2006 (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”). The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified, deferred compensation 
arrangement under which certain executives and members of the Board of Directors are able to defer a portion of their annual 
compensation. Participants may elect to contribute up to 75% of their base salary and 100%  of other specified compensation, 
including commissions, bonuses, performance-based and time-based restricted stock units, and directors’  fees. Participants are 
able to elect the payment of benefits to begin on a specified date at least three years after the end of the plan year in which election 
is made or vests. For cash benefit elections, distributions are made in cash and in the form of a lump sum, or five, ten, or fifteen-
year annual installments. For stock benefit elections, distributions are settled in stock and in the form of a lump sum payment only. 
As of November 30, 2018  and December 1, 2017 , the invested amounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan total $69.0 
million  and $56.7 million , respectively and were recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of November 30, 
2018  and December 1, 2017 , $84.0 million  and $67.2 million , respectively , was recorded as long-term liabilities to recognize 
undistributed deferred compensation due to employees.
NOTE 1 1.  ST OCK-BASED COMPENSA TION
Our stock-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide 
incentives for employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have the following stock-
based compensation plans and programs:
Restricted Stock Units
We grant restricted stock units to eligible employees under our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (“2003 Plan”). 
Restricted stock units granted as part of our annual review process or for promotions vest annually over three years. Restricted 
stock units granted to new hires generally vest over four years. Certain grants have other vesting periods approved by our Board 
of Directors or an authorized committee.
We grant performance awards to officers and key employees under our 2003 Plan which cliff-vest after three years. 
As of November 30, 2018 , we had reserved 124.5 million  shares of common stock for issuance under our 2003 Plan and 
had 54.1 million  shares available for grant.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common 
stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP  consists of a twenty-four -month offering period with four six-month 
purchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our 
common stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower . The ESPP  
will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the shares available for issuance under 
the plan have been issued.
As of November 30, 2018 , we had reserved 93.0 million  shares of our common stock for issuance under the ESPP  and 
approximately 5.3 million  shares remain available for future issuance.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
88Stock Options
The 2003 Plan allows us to grant options to all employees, including executive officers, outside consultants and non-
employee directors. This plan will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the 
shares available for issuance under the plan have been issued and restrictions on issued shares have lapsed. Option vesting periods 
used in the past were generally four years and expire seven years from the effective date of grant. 
We eliminated the use of stock option grants for all employees and non-employee directors but may choose to issue stock 
options in the future.  
Performance Shar e Programs
Our 2018 , 2017  and 2016  Performance Share Programs aim to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, 
provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding Company performance and enhance the ability of the Company to 
attract and retain highly talented and competent individuals. The Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors 
approves the terms of each of our Performance Share Programs, including the award calculation methodology , under the terms of 
our 2003 Plan. Shares may be earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder return measured over a 
three-year performance period. Performance share awards will be awarded and fully vest upon the later of the Executive 
Compensation Committee's certification of the level of achievement or the three-year anniversary of each grant. Program 
participants generally have the ability to receive up to 200%  of the target number of shares originally granted.
On January 24, 2018, the Executive Compensation Committee approved the 2018  Performance Share Program, the terms 
of which are similar to prior year performance share programs as discussed above. 
As of November 30, 2018 , the shares awarded under our 2018 , 2017  and 2016  Performance Share Programs are yet to be 
achieved.
Issuance of Shares
Upon exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares, and purchases of shares under the 
ESPP , we will issue treasury stock. If treasury stock is not available, common stock will be issued. In order to minimize the impact 
of on-going dilution from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares, we instituted a 
stock repurchase program. See Note 12 for information regarding our stock repurchase programs.
Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. 
Our performance share awards are valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. The fair value of the awards are fixed at 
grant date and amortized over the longer of the remaining performance or service period. 
 We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP  shares. The determination of the fair 
value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as 
assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility 
over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, a risk-free interest rate and 
any expected dividends.
The expected term of ESPP  shares is the average of the remaining purchase periods under each offering period. The 
assumptions used to value employee stock purchase rights were as follows:
  2018 2017 2016
Expected life (in years) 0.5 - 2.0 0.5 - 2.0 0.5 - 2.0
Volatility 26% - 29% 22% - 27% 26 - 29%
Risk free interest rate 1.54% - 2.52% 0.62% - 1.41% 0.37 - 1.06%

Grants to Executive Officers
All equity awards granted to executive officers are made after a review by and with the approval of the Executive 
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
Grants to Non-Employee Directors  
Although the 2003 Plan provides for the granting of non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units to non-employee 
directors, restricted stock units are the primary form of our grants to non-employee directors. The initial equity grant to a new

The actual target grant value will be prorated based on the number of days remaining before the next annual meeting or the date 
of the first anniversary of our last annual meeting if the next annual meeting is not yet scheduled. 
Annual equity grants to non-employee directors in the form of restricted stock units shall have an aggregate value of $0.3

Compensation Costs
We recognize the estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis 
over the requisite service period of the entire award, which is generally the vesting period. The estimated compensation cost is 
based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. 
We recognize the estimated compensation cost of performance shares, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis 
over the requisite service period of the entire award. Our performance share awards are earned upon achievement of an objective 
total stockholder return measure at the end of the three-year performance period, as described above.
We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from 
those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards 
that are expected to vest.
As of November 30, 2018 , there was $978.2 million  of unrecognized compensation cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, 
related to non-vested stock-based awards which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. Total unrecognized 
compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.

Stock Repur chase Program  
To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock 
issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In 
January 2017, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 billion
in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. In May 2018, our Board of Directors granted us another authority to repurchase 
up to $8.0 billion  in common stock through the end of fiscal 2021. The new stock repurchase program approved by our Board of 
Directors is similar to our previous stock repurchase programs.
During fiscal 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial 
institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $2.05 billion , $1.10 billion , and $1.08 billion , respectively . 
We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted 
Average Price (“VW AP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the

93discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial 
institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there 
is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used 
to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the 
contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon 
discount. During fiscal 2018 , we repurchased approximately 8.7 million  shares at an average price per share of $230.43  through 
structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017 . During fiscal 2017 , we repurchased approximately 
8.2 million  shares at an average price per share of $134.20  through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 
2017  and fiscal 2016 . During fiscal 2016 , we repurchased approximately 10.4 million  shares at an average price per share of 
$97.16  through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015 . 
For fiscal 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at 
the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 30, 2018 , December 1, 2017  and December 2, 2016
were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 30, 2018 , $150.0 million  of prepayments from our 
May 2018 authority remained under the agreement. 
Subsequent to November 30, 2018 , as part of the 2018 stock repurchase authority , we entered into a structured stock 
repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $500 million . This 
amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $500 million  stock 
repurchase agreement, $7.35 billion  remains under our May 2018 authority . As of November 30, 2018, there is no remaining 
balance under our January 2017 authority .  
NOTE 13.  NET  INCOME PER SHARE
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, 
excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance awards. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted average 
common shares outstanding for the period plus dilutive potential common shares, including unvested restricted stock units, 
performance share awards, and stock options using the treasury stock method.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2018 , 2017  and 2016  (in

94NOTE 14.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 Lease Commitments
We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire 
at various dates through 2031 . We also have one land lease that expires in 2091 . Rent expense includes base contractual rent and 
variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was 
approximately $137.2 million  in fiscal 2018 , $115.4 million  in fiscal 2017 , and $92.9 million  in fiscal 2016 . Our sublease income 
was immaterial for all periods presented.
We occupy three  office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these 
office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. 
In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million . Upon 
purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million  was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the 
Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million , the lesser of cost or fair value, 
which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of November 30, 2018 , we own 
the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden 
Tower . 
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. 
The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations and operating leases for each of the next 
five years and thereafter as of November 30, 2018  (in thousands):

Total $ 733,833 $ 702,323 $ 35,767
Royalties
We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally 
based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded under our cost 
of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $119.1 million , $100.9 million  and $79.8 million  in 
fiscal 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , respectively .
Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual 
property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims 
by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically , costs related to these indemnification provisions have not 
been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future 
results of operations.
Table of Contents
ADOBE INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
95To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for 
certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity . The indemnification 
period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director ’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of 
future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however , we have director 
and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We 
believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.
Legal Proceedings
In connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including 
patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. 
Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the 
attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past 
litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property disputes 
could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent 
us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products 
or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification 
commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.
In addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary 
course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal 
proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a 
quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP  and based on known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably 
possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue 
for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with our Audit Committee and our 
independent registered public accounting firm.
We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can 
be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, 
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise 
specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim 
against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be 
incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is 
immaterial.
All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However , we 
believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our 
consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of 
one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.
In connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software 
Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter -claims 
alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter -
claims; however , it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively 
affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter -claims.

96NOTE 15.  DEBT
Our long-term debt as of November 30, 2018  and December 1, 2017  consisted of the following (in thousands):
  2018 2017
Term loan $ 2,248,427 $ —
Notes 1,886,1 17 1,882,479
Fair value of interest rate swap (9,744 ) (1,058 )
Adjusted carrying value of long-term debt $ 4,124,800 $ 1,881,421
Term Loan Credit Agreement
In October 2018, we entered into a credit agreement providing for an up to $2.25 billion  senior unsecured term loan for the 
purpose of partially funding the purchase price for our acquisition of Marketo and the related fees and expenses incurred in 
connection with the acquisition.  The Term Loan funds were received on October 31, 2018 upon closing of the acquisition and will 
mature 18 months  following the initial funding date. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $0.7 million  which are amortized 
to interest expense over the term using the straight-line method. The Term Loan ranks equally with our other unsecured and 
unsubordinated indebtedness. There are no scheduled principal amortization payments prior to maturity and the term loan may be 
prepaid and terminated at our election at any time without penalty or premium. At our election, the Term Loan will bear interest 
at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500%  to 1.000%  or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, 
based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040%  to 0.110%. Interest is payable periodically , in arrears, at the end of each interest 
period we elect.
The Term Loan credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, events 
of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders similar to those contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement, 
including the financial covenant.  As of November 30, 2018 , we were in compliance with all covenants.
As of November 30, 2018 , there were $2.25 billion  outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan, which is included in 
long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In November 2018, we made interest payments of approximately $5.7 
million .
Senior Notes
In February 2010, we issued $900 million  of 4.75%  senior notes due February 1, 2020 . Our proceeds were $900 million  
and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million . In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million . Both the discount 
and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. 
The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the 
discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually , in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced 
on August 1, 2010 . 
In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million  designated as a fair value 
hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating 
interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate 
plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million  notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75%  fixed rate interest 
from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives.
In January 2015, we issued $1 billion  of 3.25%  senior notes due February 1, 2025  (the “2025 Notes”). Our proceeds were 
approximately $989.3 million  which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million . In addition, we incurred issuance costs of 
$7.9 million . Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using 
the effective interest method. The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective 
interest rate including the discount, issuance costs and interest rate agreement is 3.67% . Interest is payable semi-annually , in arrears 
on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2015 . 
As of November 30, 2018 , our outstanding notes payable consist of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes (the “Notes”) with a 
total carrying value of $1.88 billion , which includes the fair value of the interest rate swaps and is net of debt issuance costs. Based

97on quoted prices in inactive markets, the fair value of the Notes was $1.89 billion  as of November 30, 2018 , which excludes the 
effect of the fair value of the interest rate swaps described above. 
We may redeem the Notes at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change 
of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the Notes, at a price equal to 101%  of their principal amount, plus 
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The Notes also include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on 
assets and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances. As of November 30, 2018 , we were in 
compliance with all of the covenants.
In February and August 2018 , we made semi-annual interest payments on our 2020 and 2025 Notes each totaling $37.6 
million .
 
Credit Agreement
On October 17, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”), providing for a five-year 
$1 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility , which replaces our previous five-year $1 billion  senior unsecured revolving 
credit agreement dated as of March 2, 2012 (as amended, the “Prior Revolving Credit Agreement”). In addition, we incurred 
issuance costs of $0.8 million  which is amortized to interest expense over the term using the straight-line method. The Revolving 
Credit Agreement provides for loans to Adobe and certain of its subsidiaries that may be designated from time to time as additional 
borrowers. Pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the agreement of lenders to provide 
additional commitments, obtain up to an additional $500 million  in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $1.5 
billion . At our election, loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based 
on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.585%  to 1.015%  or (ii) a base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the agent’ s prime 
rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.500%  or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00%  plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging 
from 0.000%  to 0.015% . In addition, facility fees determined according to our debt ratings are payable on the aggregate 
commitments, regardless of usage, quarterly in an amount ranging from 0.040%  to 0.110% per annum. We are permitted to 
permanently reduce the aggregate commitment under the Revolving Credit Agreement at any time. Subject to certain conditions 
stated in the Revolving Credit Agreement, Adobe and any of its subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow , 
prepay and re-borrow amounts at any time during the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement.
In connection with and at the time that we entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Prior Revolving Credit 
Agreement originally scheduled to expire on July 27, 2020 was terminated. There were no outstanding borrowings or letters of 
credit issued under the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement at the time of termination. There were no penalties paid as a result of 
the termination of the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement.
The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, 
including a financial covenant, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants 
include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, certain merger and acquisition transactions, dispositions 
and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant, based on a quarterly financial test, requires us not to 
exceed a maximum leverage ratio. 
The facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on the maturity date unless (a) the 
commitments are terminated earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event of default, or (b) the maturity date 
is further extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders.
As of November 30, 2018 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement and we were in 
compliance with all covenants.

NOTE 17.  INDUSTR Y SEGMENT , GEOGRAPHIC INFORMA TION AND SIGNIFICANT  CUST OMERS
We report segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal 
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments.
Our CEO, the chief operating decision maker , reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable 
segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and 
intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. 
Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience (formerly Digital Marketing), 
and Publishing (formerly Print and Publishing). These segments provide our senior management with a comprehensive financial 
view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities described above, placing our 
Publishing business in a third segment that contains some of our mature products and solutions.
For fiscal 2018 , we have the following reportable segments:
• Digital Media— Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium 
businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers 
include traditional content creators, web application developers and digital media professionals, as well as their 
management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include 
knowledge workers who create, collaborate and distribute documents. 
• Digital Experience— Our Digital Experience segment provides solutions and services for how digital advertising 
and marketing are created, managed, executed, measured and optimized. Our customers include digital marketers, 
advertisers, publishers, merchandisers, web analysts, chief marketing officers, chief information officers and chief 
revenue officers. This segment also includes our marketing cloud platform offerings and commerce platform 
offerings from the Magento and Marketo acquisitions in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively .

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS (Continued)
99• Publishing— Our Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse authoring and 
publishing needs of technical and business publishing to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses. It also 
includes our web conferencing and document and forms platforms effective fiscal 2018. 
In fiscal 2018, we moved our legacy enterprise offerings—Adobe Connect web conferencing platform and Adobe LiveCycle, 
an enterprise document and forms platform—from our Digital Experience segment into Publishing, in order to more closely align 
our Digital Experience business with the strategic growth opportunity . Prior year information in the tables below have been

101REPOR T OF INDEPENDENT  REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Adobe Inc.:
 
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Contr ol Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Adobe Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of November 
30, 2018 and December 1, 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’  equity , and 
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended November 30, 2018, and the related notes (collectively , the 
consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting as of November 
30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the financial position 
of the Company as of November 30, 2018 and December 1, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of 
the years in the three-year period ended November 30, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
November 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The Company acquired Magento on June 18, 2018 and Marketo on October 31, 2018, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated 
financial statements. As discussed in Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under 
Item 9A, management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Adobe Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting 
as of November 30, 2018, Magento and Marketo’ s internal control over financial reporting associated with consolidated total assets 
of approximately 1.1%, and consolidated total revenues of approximately 1.0%, included in the Company’ s consolidated financial 
statements as of and for the year ended November 30, 2018. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Adobe Inc. 
as of November 30, 2018, also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Magento and Marketo.
Basis for Opinions  
The Company’ s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control 
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the 
accompanying Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’ s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’ s 
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in 
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether 
due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such 
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial 
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits 
also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide 
a reasonable basis for our opinions.

102Definition and Limitations of Internal Contr ol Over Financial Reporting 
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosur e Contr ols and Procedur es
Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2018 . Based on their evaluation 
as of November 30, 2018 , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls 
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were 
effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on 
Form 10-K was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’ s rules and 
regulations and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure 
controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no 
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control 
system are met. Further , the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of 
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of 
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Adobe have been detected.
Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as 
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness 
of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2018 . In making this assessment, our management used the 
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Our management has concluded that, 
as of November 30, 2018 , our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.
We acquired Magento on June 18, 2018 and Marketo on October 31, 2018, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. As permitted by the SEC staff’s Frequently Asked Question 3 on Management’ s Report on Internal Control 
Over Financial Reporting and Certification of Disclosure in Exchange Act Periodic Reports (revised September 24, 2007), our 
management excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting effectiveness as of November 30, 2018 , 
Magento and Marketo’ s internal control over financial reporting associated with consolidated total assets of approximately 1.1%, 
and consolidated total revenues of approximately 1.0%, included in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year 
ended November 30, 2018 . We will include Magento and Marketo in our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over 
financial reporting starting fiscal 2019.
KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended November 30, 2018  that 
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
