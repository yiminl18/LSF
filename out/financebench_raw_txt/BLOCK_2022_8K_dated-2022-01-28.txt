le of A$0.01. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price where such adjustment (rounded down ifapplicable) would be less th
an one per cent. of the Conversion Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or anyamount by which the Conversion Price has b
een rounded down, shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequentadjustment, and such subsequent ad

ability to issue Ordinary Shares on conversion as fully paid or result in Ordinary Shares being required tobe issued in circumstanc
es not permitted by applicable laws or regulations.No adjustment involving an incr
ease in the Conversion Price will be made, except in the case of a consolidation of the Ordinary Shares asreferred to in Condition 6(b
)(i) above. The Issuer may at any time and for a specified period only, following notice being given to theTrustee and to Noteholders in a
ccordance with Condition 17, reduce the Conversion Price.

Conversion
Notice ”) in the form (for th e time being current) obtainable from any Conversion Agent. Conversion Rightsshall be exercised subje
ct in each case to any applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations applicable in the jurisdiction in which thespecified office of 
the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent or such other Conversion Agent to whom the relevant Conversion Notice isdelivered is located. 
If such delivery is made after 5.00 p.m. on a business day or on a day which is not a business day, in either case in theplace of the specifi
ed office of the relevant Conversion Agent, such delivery shall be deemed for all purposes of these Conditions to havebeen made on the next following su
ch business day.Any determination as to whethe
r any Conversion Notice has been duly completed and properly delivered shall be made by the relevantConversion Agent and shall, save in the 
case of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Issuer, the Trustee, the Conversion Agentsand the relevant Noteholde

Issuer, any Noteholder or any other person to pay such capital, stamp, issue, registration, transfer and/or othertaxes and/or duties.
Ordinary Shares to be issued on exer
cise of Conversion Rights will be issued, at the option of the Noteholder exercising its ConversionRight as specified in the Convers
ion Notice, either: 
 
(A)in uncertificated form through the securities trading system known as the Clearing House Electronic Sub-register  System operated by ASX Settlement Pty Ltd (“
CHESS ”) (or any successor lice nsed clearance and settlement facility applicable to the OrdinaryShares), or
 
 
(B) in uncertificated form through the Issuer’s share registry provider, and in the case of: 
 
(x)paragraph (A) above of this Condit ion 6(h), the Ordinary Shares will be credited to the CHESS holding specified (or to a newholding in the name of the Noteho
lder (or such other person specified by the Noteholder in the conversion notice) sponsored by aCHESS sponsor specified) in the Conversion Notice
; or 
 
(y)paragraph (B) above of this Condit ion 6(h), the Ordinary Shares will be credited to an account with the share registry provider inthe name of the Noteholder 
(or such other person specified in the Conversion Notice),in each case by a date which 
is generally expected to be not later than five Sydney business days after the relevant ConversionDate.
Statements of holdings for Ordin
ary Shares issued on exercise of Conversion Rights through CHESS will be dispatched by the Issuer bymail free of charg
e as soon as practicable but in any event within 10 Sydney business days after the relevant Conversion Date.On conversion:
 
 
(a)each Noteholder concerned, for each Note held at that time by the Noteholder concerned and in respect of which a ConversionRight is to be exercised (e
ach a “Relevant
Note ”), agrees to subscribe fo r the number of Ordinary Shares calculated in accordancewith these Conditions for an aggreg
ate subscription amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares that the Noteholder isentitled to receiv
e on conversion of the Relevant Note in accordance with these Conditions and (y) the volume weighted averageprice of Ordinary Shares in th
e Issuer over the five Dealing Days up to but excluding the relevant Conversion Date (the“
Subscription
Amount”);  
 
(b)the Issuer will redeem each Relevant Note for an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares that the Noteholder isentitled to receiv
e on conversion of the Relevant Note in accordance with these Conditions and (y) the volume weighted averageprice of Ordinary Shares in th
e Issuer over the five Dealing Days up to but excluding the relevant Conversion Date (the“
Redemption
Amount”), and the Issuer will apply the whole of the Redemption Amount in respect of the redemption of eachRelevant Note by way of satisfac
tion of the Subscription Amount for the Ordinary Shares to be allotted; and 
31

 (c)the Issuer and such Noteholder sha ll be deemed to agree to set-off  their respective r ights and obligations to the relevantSubscription Amount and the relev
ant Redemption Amount in full, and each Noteholder is taken to have irrevocably directed thatany amount payable under this Condi
tion 6(h) is to be applied as provided for in this paragraph.On the Conversion Date, the Issuer must 
issue, or otherwise deliver (or procure the issue or delivery as the case may be), to eachNoteholder (or to such other pe
rson as the Holder may specify in the Conversion Notice provided that such person is a person to whom atransfer of the Notes could b
e made in compliance with Condition 4) the number of Ordinary Shares for its Notes calculated in accordancewith these Conditions. Provided the Issue
r is admitted to the official list of the ASX, on the date of issue of Ordinary Shares issued onconversion of a Note, the Issuer wi
ll apply for quotation of such Ordinary Shares on the ASX. In the event that the Ordinary Shares areadmitted to listing on an Al
ternative Stock Exchange, the Issuer shall apply for quotation of such Ordinary Shares on the Alternative StockExchange.
The lodgement of an applic
ation for quotation of the Ordinary Shares with the ASX or the Alternative Stock Exchange, as the case may be,by the Issuer will constitut
e a representation and warranty by the Issuer to the person to whom the Ordinary Shares in question are issuedon Conversion (“
Recipient ”) that:  
 
(I)the Ordinary Shares issued on convers ion are issued solely for the purpose of satisfying the Issuer’s contractual obligations underthe terms of the Notes and not 
for the purpose of the person to whom those Ordinary Shares are issued, selling or transferring theOrdinary Shares or granting, issuing o
r transferring an interest in, or options over, them; 
 
(II)subject to the ASX or the Alternat ive Stock Exchange, as the case may be, granting quotation of the Ordinary Shares issued onconversion of Notes, they will be f
reely tradable in the ordinary course on the ASX or the Alternative Stock Exchange, as the casemay be;
 
 
(III) the Ordinary Shares issued on convers ion will be issued in compliance with the ASX Listing Rules and all applicable laws; and 
 
(IV)an offer of the Ordinary Shar es issued on conversion for sale within 12 months after their issue will not require disclosure undersection 707(3) of the Corporat
ions Act.Without limiting its ob
ligations under this Condition 6(h), the Issuer shall use its best endeavours, and furnish all such quotationapplications, documents, in
formation and undertakings as may be reasonably necessary in order, to procure the ASX or the AlternativeStock Exchange quotation, as the c
ase may be, referred to in this Condition 6 on the Conversion Date (including, without limitation, anyrelevant ASX or Alternative Stock Ex
change forms). 
 
(i) Ordinary Shares  
 
(i)Ordinary Shares (including any Addit ional Ordinary Shares) issued or transferred and delivered upon conversion of the Notes willbe fully paid and will in al
l respects rank pari passu with the fully paid Ordinary Shar es in issue on the relevant Conversion Dateor, in the case of Additional Ord
inary Shares, on the relevant Reference Date, and the relevant holder shall be entitled to all rights,distribution or payments th
e record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement for which falls on or after therelevant Conversion Date, or as 
the case may be, the relevant Reference Date, except in any such case for any right excluded bymandatory provisions of appli
cable law or as otherwise may be provided in these Conditions. Such Ordinary Shares or, as the casemay be, Additional Ordinary Shares wi
ll not rank for (or, as the case may be, the relevant holder shall not be entitled to receive)any rights, distributions or pay
ments the record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement for which falls prior tothe relevant Conversion Date o
r, as the case may be, the relevant Reference Date. 
32

For the avoidance of doubt, the issue of any Ordinary Shares following the exercise of a Conversion Right and the payment of anyDividend payable on any Ordinary Shares sh
all be settled directly between the Issuer and the relevant Noteholder.

Issuer may exercise such rights as it may from time to time enjoy as permitted under applicable law topurchase or redeem or buy ba

e Agents shall be under any duty to monitor whether any event or circumstance has happened or exists whichrequires or may requir
e an adjustment to be made to the Conversion Price and none of them will be responsible or liable to the Noteholdersor any other person for any loss a
