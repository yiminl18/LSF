PART I
Item 1—Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are
principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.),
Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland, China, and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Costco operated 815, 795,
and 782 warehouses worldwide at August 29, 2021, August 30, 2020, and September 1, 2019, respectively. The Company operates e-
commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market, under the symbol “COST.”
We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first
three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week
year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2021,
2020, and 2019 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 29, 2021, August 30, 2020, and September 1, 2019, respectively.
General
We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited
selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory
turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of
merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross
margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while
taking advantage of early payment discounts.
We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our
warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight
volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. For our e-
3
Table of Contents
commerce operations we ship merchandise through our depots, our logistics operations for big and bulky items, as well as through drop-ship
and other delivery arrangements with our suppliers.
Our average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for
economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted
principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and
using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.
Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of
operation are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to
the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities,
reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards,
debit cards, cash and checks, co-brand cardholder rebates, Executive member 2% reward certificates and our proprietary stored-value card
(shop card).
Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than
elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per
warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 9,000 to 11,000 SKUs
online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack
quantities only.
In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a
90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty
coverage is sold on certain electronic items.
We offer merchandise and services in the following categories:
Core Merchandise Categories (or core business):
•Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco)
•Non-Foods (previously Hardlines and Softlines; including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, garden and
patio, sporting goods, tires, toys and seasonal, office supplies, automotive care, postage, tickets, apparel, small appliances, furniture,
domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry)
•Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery)
Warehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-
commerce, business centers, travel, and other)
Warehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number
of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 636 gas
stations at the end of 2021. Net sales for our gasoline business represented approximately 9% of total net sales in 2021.
Our other businesses sell products and services that complement our warehouse operations (core and warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-
commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services. Net sales for e-commerce represented
approximately 7% of total net sales in 2021. This figure does not consider other services we offer online in certain countries such as business
delivery, travel, same-day grocery, and various other services. Our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services,
convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco
Travel offers vacation

packages, hotels, cruises, and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.).
We have direct buying relationships with many producers of brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise
from any one supplier. The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented supply constraints, including disruptions and delays that have impacted
and could continue to impact the flow and availability of certain products. When sources of supply become unavailable, we seek alternative
sources. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our
members is significant.
Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8 of this Report.
Membership
Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and websites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies in other countries. All paid
memberships include a free household card.
Our member renewal rate was 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 89% worldwide at the end of 2021. The majority of members renew within six
months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months
prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12
months prior to the reporting date. At the end of 2020, we standardized our membership count methodology globally to be consistent with the
U.S. and Canada, which resulted in the addition to the count of approximately 2.0 million total cardholders for 2020, of which 1.3 million were
paid members. The change did not impact 2019. Membership fee income and the renewal rate calculations were not affected. Our membership
was made up of the following (in thousands):
2021 2020 2019
Gold Star 50,200 46,800 42,900 
Business, including affiliates 11,500 11,300 11,000 
Total paid members 61,700 58,100 53,900 
Household cards 49,900 47,400 44,600 
    Total cardholders 111,600 105,500 98,500 
Paid cardholders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada, for an additional annual fee of
$60. Executive memberships are also available in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, for which the additional annual fee varies.
Executive members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), which can be redeemed
only at Costco warehouses. This program also offers (except in Mexico and Korea), access to additional savings and benefits on various
business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing. These services are
generally provided by third parties and vary by state and country. Executive members totaled 25.6 million and represented 55% of paid members
(excluding affiliates) in the U.S. and Canada and 17% of paid members (excluding affiliates) in our Other International operations at the end of
2021. They generally shop more frequently and spend more than other members.

Human Capital
Our Code of Ethics requires that we “Take Care of Our Employees,” which is fundamental to the obligation to “Take Care of Our Members.” We
must also carefully control our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, so that we can sell high quality goods and services at low
prices. Compensation and benefits for employees is our largest expense after the cost of merchandise and is carefully monitored.
At the end of 2021, we employed 288,000 employees worldwide. The large majority (approximately 95%) is employed in our membership
warehouses and distribution channels and approximately 17,000 employees are represented by unions. We also utilize seasonal employees
during peak periods. The total number of employees by segment is:
Number of Employees
2021 2020 2019
United States 192,000 181,000 167,000 
Canada 47,000 46,000 42,000 
Other International 49,000 46,000 45,000 
Total employees 288,000 273,000 254,000 
We believe that our warehouses are among the most productive in the retail industry, owing in substantial part to the commitment and efficiency
of our employees. We seek to provide them not merely with employment but careers. Many attributes of our business contribute to the objective;
the more significant include: competitive compensation and benefits for those working in our membership warehouses and distributions
channels; a commitment to promoting from within; and maintaining a ratio of at least 50% of our employee base being full-time employees.
These attributes contribute to what we consider, especially for the industry, a high retention rate. In 2021, in the U.S. that rate was above 90% for
employees who have been with us for at least one year.
The commitment to “Take Care of Our Employees” is also the foundation of our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion and creating an
inclusive and respectful workplace. In 2021, we added training and communication for managers on topics of race, bias and equity, and greater
visibility of our employee demographics. Embracing differences is important to the growth of our Company. It leads to more opportunities,
innovation, and employee satisfaction and connects us to the communities where we do business.
Costco is firmly committed to helping protect the health and safety of our members and employees and to serving our communities. In response
to the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated challenges, we began providing premium pay to the majority of our hourly employees in March
2020 and continued for a full year through February 2021, at which time a portion of the premium was built permanently into our hourly wage
scales in the U.S. In fall 2020, we also began offering employees additional paid time off to attend to child care and schooling needs through the
2021 school year. As the global effect of coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to evolve, we are closely monitoring the changing situation and
complying with public health guidance.

website). This report and other information on our website are not incorporated by reference into and do not form any part of this Annual Report.

Competition
Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution
strategy, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including
supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a
single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail
competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse clubs including Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club, and many of the
major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple clubs.
Intellectual Property
We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names
and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the
development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland
Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at prices that are generally lower than national brands, and help
lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration
of our private-label items.
We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers,
employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however,
trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.
Available Information
Our U.S. website is www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of that site, free of charge, our Annual Reports
on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments

We have adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers, pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Copies of the code are
available free of charge by writing to Secretary, Costco Wholesale Corporation, 999 Lake Drive, Issaquah, WA 98027. If the Company makes
any amendments to this code (other than technical, administrative, or non-substantive amendments) or grants any waivers, including implicit
waivers, to the CEO, chief financial officer or principal accounting officer and controller, we will disclose (on our website or in a Form 8-K report
filed with the SEC) the nature of the amendment or waiver, its effective date, and to whom it applies.

Item 1A—Risk Factors
The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could also be
affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us
or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of
this Report.
Business and Operating Risks
We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.
Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 86% and 81% of net
sales and operating income in 2021, respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 28%
of U.S. net sales in 2021. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other
domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial
results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among
other things: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including
increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new
warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including
higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products.
We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets,
and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other
retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses
and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local
laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and
of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on
acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or
expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may
affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future
growth and profitability.
We seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members away from our existing
warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability.
We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity
with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in
the market. Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established
market presence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commerce websites will be profitable and future profitability could be
delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.

Table of Contents
We have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains and
delivery channels. The effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the
anticipated benefits or desired rates of return.
Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations.
Membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the
penetration of Executive membership, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation
may negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee
revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.
We sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of these
products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand
products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or
confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.
Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and
member satisfaction.
We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. We also rely upon
processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.
Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme
weather conditions or catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of
merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce business depends
heavily on third-party and in-house logistics providers and that business is negatively affected when these providers are unable to provide
services in a timely fashion.
We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our
members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.
It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our
ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing
consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to environmental, social and governance practices) and spending patterns could
negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at
predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns,
or we may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of which would reduce our operating
performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.
Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital to our business. Failure to successfully execute IT
projects and have IT systems available to our business would adversely impact our operations.
IT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business. These systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions, conduct
payment transactions, track and value our inventory and produce reports critical for making business decisions. Failure or disruption of these
systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing
plants, move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to our members. We are undertaking large technology and
IT transformation projects. The failure of these

projects could adversely impact our business plans and potentially impair our day to day business operations. Given the high volume of
transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer
and telecommunications failures, viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events such as fires,
earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes. Any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems, data centers and backup systems would require
significant investments in resources to restore IT services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of
business services, increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members. We are currently making substantial
investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business.
Failure to deliver IT transformation efforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our
financial condition and results of operations.
We are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst multiplying threat landscapes and
in compliance with privacy and data protection regulations globally. Failure to do so could damage our business, including our
reputation with members, suppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation
and regulatory action.
Increased security threats and more sophisticated cyber misconduct pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon
IT systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with virtually all of our business activities. Additionally, we
collect, store and process sensitive information relating to our business, members, suppliers and employees. Operating these IT systems and
networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Increased remote
work due to the COVID-19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Threats designed to gain unauthorized access to systems,
networks and data, both ours and third parties with whom we work, are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may
range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent threats.
Phishing attacks have emerged as particularly prominent, including as vectors for ransomware attacks, which have increased in breadth and
frequency. While we train our employees as part of our security efforts, that training cannot be completely effective. These threats pose a risk to
the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. It is possible that our IT systems and
networks, or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers or suppliers that otherwise host confidential information, could have
vulnerabilities, which could go unnoticed for a period of time. While our cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate such risks, there
can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and our third-party service providers have implemented and are implementing, will be
sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property.
The potential impacts of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation, government enforcement actions, penalties,
disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our
investment in IT systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect our competitiveness, results
of operations and financial condition and, critically in light of our business model, loss of member confidence. Further, the insurance coverage we
maintain and indemnification arrangements with third-parties may be inadequate to cover claims, costs, and liabilities relating to cybersecurity
incidents. In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, such as the
European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and
other emerging privacy and cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe, which may carry significant potential penalties for
noncompliance.

We are subject to payment-related risks.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including select credit and debit cards, cash and checks, co-brand cardholder rebates,
Executive member 2% reward certificates, and our shop card. As we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to
additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other
related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing
services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these parties become unwilling or unable to provide these
services to us. We are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification
requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards,
which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and
transmission of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs,
subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, and our business and operating
results could be adversely affected.
We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and expose us to litigation.
If our merchandise, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children's products, pet products and durable
goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety or labeling standards or our members' expectations, we could experience lost
sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses
or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects,
substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or
faulty design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure
that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to
comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause
illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product
recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is
not fully pursued, negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand
image, and these effects could be long-term.
If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could
be adversely impacted.
Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our
competitors. Our members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through
social media, particularly in the wake of COVID-19. We are making investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to
make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be
adversely affected.

Inability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Our success depends on the continued contributions of our employees, including members of our senior management and other key operations,
IT, merchandising and administrative personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negatively
impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs
and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including the
continuing impacts of the pandemic, regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with
other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no
assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.
Claims for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle
liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks
to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with
respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care
or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial
condition and results of operations.
Although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a
result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of
inventory, and business interruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.
Market and Other External Risks
We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects
with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other
warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores
and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of
ways, including pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of
websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison
shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to
merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail
markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.
General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.
Higher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign-currency exchange rates,
unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related
to government fiscal

and tax policies including changes in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, pandemics and other health crises, and
other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or
ability to purchase inventory. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China, the United States and the United Kingdom, have raised
the cost of many items and created uncertainty with respect to tariff impacts on the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our
exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross
margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases. While these potential impacts
are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results.
Prices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are
historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures,
labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in
commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could
also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and
financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism.
Inflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If
inflation on merchandise increases beyond our ability to control we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various
cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand. Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we
have experienced in recent years due to, among other things, the continuing impacts of the pandemic and uncertain economic environment.
Suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high
standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.
We depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require
continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to
change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of
sales and profits.
We buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or
the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from
alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which
available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available.
Our suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities,
financial liquidity, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and
political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere
to our quality control, packaging, legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude
delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and
litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business.

Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
During 2021, our international operations, including Canada, generated 28% and 36% of our net sales and operating income, respectively. Our
international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare
our consolidated financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars
using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of
our Canadian and Other International operations and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we
continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase.
A portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currency
fluctuations may increase our merchandise costs and may not be passed on to members. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates
may adversely affect our results of operations.
Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, typhoons, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts; acts of terrorism or
violence, including active shooter situations; energy shortages; public health issues, including pandemics and quarantines, particularly in
California or Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our
operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, limitations on store operating hours, less
frequent visits by members to physical locations, the temporary closure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the
temporary lack of an adequate work force, disruptions to our IT systems, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from
some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our
warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in
the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact on consumer
spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products.
We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in many respects.
The continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile and are affecting certain business operations, demand
for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our
ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things.
The pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and on our employees, members, suppliers and other
people and entities with which we do business. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread
and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and
business and government shutdowns. The pandemic and any preventative or protective actions that governments or we may take may result in
business disruption, reduced member traffic and reduced sales in certain merchandise categories, and increased operating expenses.
The pandemic is continuing to impact the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on business activities causing disruption and delay,
which have strained certain domestic and international supply chains, and could continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain
products. Member demand for certain products has and may continue to fluctuate as the pandemic progresses and member

behaviors change, which may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. Similarly, increased demand
for online purchases of products has impacted our fulfillment operations, resulting in delays in deliveries and lost sales from being out of stock for
certain SKUs.
Failure to appropriately respond, or the perception of an inadequate response to evolving events around the pandemic, could cause reputational
harm to our brand and subject us to lost sales, as well as claims from employees, members, suppliers, regulators or other parties. Additionally, a
future outbreak of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our facilities could result in temporary or sustained workforce shortages or facility closures,
which would negatively impact our business and results of operations. Some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand the
availability of workers compensation or to change the presumptions applicable to workers compensation measures. These actions may increase
our exposure to claims and increase our costs.
Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
•The severity and duration of the pandemic, including future mutations or related variants of the virus in areas in which we operate;
•Evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures;
•Changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers;
•Unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other
resources to the pandemic response;
•The pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides.
•The long-term impact of the pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors; and
•Disruption and volatility within the financial and credit markets.
To the extent that COVID-19 continues to adversely affect the U.S. and global economy, our business, results of operations, cash flows, or
financial condition, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and
expectations, competition, brand reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology
systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, operational risk as a result of remote work arrangements and
regulatory requirements.
Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.
We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. Government regulations limiting carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energy inputs
could materially affect our profitability. Climate change, extreme weather conditions, wildfires, droughts and rising sea levels could affect our
ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for
which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which face increased regulation.
Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
We believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in
meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new member
sign-ups, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the price
of our stock to decline.

Legal and Regulatory Risks
We are subject to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the
countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
At the end of 2021, we operated 251 warehouses outside of the U.S., and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future
operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which
are beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, policy changes
such as the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in
the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal
policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having
major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among
others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property
rights.
Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex
accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are
relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by
our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could
significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure
controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within
required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and
payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.
Changes in tax rates, new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, and exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations.
We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at
any point in time, we may be under examination for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may
recognize additional tax expense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, or incur losses and penalties, due to changes in laws, regulations,
administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We
compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change
in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision.
Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Significant changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous
materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
We are subject to a wide and increasingly broad array of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use,
storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to
comply with these laws could result in harm to our members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance,
remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or
courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Operations at our facilities require the treatment and disposal of wastewater, stormwater and agricultural and food processing wastes, the use
and maintenance of refrigeration systems, including ammonia-based chillers, noise, odor and dust management, the operation of mechanized
processing equipment, and other operations that potentially could affect the environment and public health and safety. Failure to comply with
current and future environmental, health and safety standards could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, illness or injury of our
employees, and claims or lawsuits related to such illnesses or injuries, and temporary closures or limits on the operations of facilities.
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other
proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines, penalties, and remediation costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal
proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed
property laws, and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies, including
environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these proceedings, audits,
unclaimed property laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our
operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and
resources.

Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except per
share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)
The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote
understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with,
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section
generally discusses the results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in
financial condition for 2020 compared to 2019 refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations in our fiscal year 2020 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October
7, 2020. In 2021, we combined the hardlines and softlines merchandise categories into non-foods. This change did not have a material impact
on the discussion of our results of operations.
Overview
We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. Net sales includes our
core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food
court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable
sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-
commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new
and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by
certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our
international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive
of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of
sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right
merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net
sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.
Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global,
national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general
economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes,
such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through
online offerings.
Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on
maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality
goods – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on
merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our
members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business
draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses
as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin
percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit
net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a
percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China, the
United States and the United Kingdom, have created

uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among
other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than
what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing
strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results.
We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more
difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such
growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses
when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of
operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that
to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross
margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations.
The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce
member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of
our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be
adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.
Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant
costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our
philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing
employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for
much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces.
Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly
merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.
Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 12 to the
consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher
rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or
lack an e-commerce business.
In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are
references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local
currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference
between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net
sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.
Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2021, 2020, and 2019 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended
August 29, 2021, August 30, 2020, and September 1, 2019, respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior
to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.

Highlights for 2021 included:
•We opened 22 new warehouses, including 2 relocations: 12 net new in the U.S., 4 net new in our Canadian segment, and 4 new in our
Other International segment, compared to 16 new warehouses, including 3 relocations in 2020;
•Net sales increased 18% to $192,052 driven by a 16% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2020 and
2021;
•Membership fee revenue increased 9% to $3,877, driven by sign-ups and upgrades to Executive membership;
•Gross margin percentage decreased seven basis points, driven primarily by a shift in sales penetration from our core merchandise
categories to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses;
•SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and decreased
incremental wages related to COVID-19;
•The effective tax rate in 2021 was 24.0% compared to 24.4% in 2020;
•Net income increased 25% to $5,007, or $11.27 per diluted share compared to $4,002, or $9.02 per diluted share in 2020;
•We paid a special cash dividend of $10.00 per share in December 2020 and in April 2021, increased the quarterly cash dividend from $0.70
to $0.79 per share totaling $5,748.
COVID-19
During 2021, our sales mix began returning to pre-pandemic levels. This included sales increases in non-foods and in many of our warehouse
ancillary and other businesses, certain of which experienced closures or restrictions in 2020. COVID-related supply and logistics constraints
have adversely affected some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future.
We paid $515 in incremental wages during 2021 related to COVID-19. The incremental wage and benefit costs associated with COVID-19,
which began on March 1, 2020 and ended on February 28, 2021, totaled approximately $825.
Effective March 1, 2021, we permanently increased wages for hourly and most salaried warehouse employees. The estimated annualized pre-
tax cost is approximately $400. Additionally, in certain areas in the United States governments have mandated or are considering mandating
extra pay for classes of employees that include our employees, which has and will result in higher costs.

Net Sales
Net sales increased $28,832 or 18% during 2021. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 16%, and sales at
new warehouses opened in 2020 and 2021. While sales in all core merchandise categories increased, sales were particularly strong in non-
foods. Sales increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline. Certain
merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years.
Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $2,759, or 169 basis points, compared to
2020, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. Changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $1,636, or
100 basis points, compared to 2020, due to a 12% increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased
approximately 10%, positively impacting net sales by $1,469, or 90 basis points.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket. There was
an increase of 44% in e-commerce comparable sales in 2021, driven by an increase of 80% in the first half of the year.(1)

Membership fees increased 9% in 2021, driven by sign-ups and upgrades to Executive membership. Excluding the positive impact of changes in
foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, membership fees increased 8%. At the end of 2021, our member renewal rates were 91% in the
U.S. and Canada and 89% worldwide. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen
months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year
membership period.
Gross Margin

Net sales $ 192,052$ 163,220$ 149,351
Less merchandise costs 170,684 144,939 132,886
Gross margin $ 21,368$ 18,281$ 16,465
Gross margin percentage 11.13 % 11.20 % 11.02 %
The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core
merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration
and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The increase was across all categories, most significantly in non-foods.
Total gross margin percentage decreased seven basis points compared to 2020. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales in
2021, gross margin percentage was 11.22%, an increase of two basis points. This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our
core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce. The
comparison was also positively impacted by a three basis point reserve on inventory recorded in 2020 with no such reserve this year. Gross
margin percentage was negatively impacted three basis points due to increased 2% rewards and two basis points due to a LIFO charge for
higher merchandise costs. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted gross margin by approximately $301 in
2021.
Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in
gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased in our U.S. segment, due to our warehouse ancillary and other
businesses, our core merchandise categories, and the LIFO charge, partially offset by the reserve for certain inventory in 2020. Our Canadian
and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise
categories. These increases were partially offset by increased 2% rewards.

excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.69%, a decrease of 32 basis points. Warehouse operations and other businesses were
lower by 24 basis points, largely attributable to payroll leveraging increased sales. Incremental wages as a result of COVID-19, which ended on
February 28, 2021, were lower by eight basis points. Central operating costs were lower by five basis points. Stock compensation expense was
lower by three basis points, and costs associated with the acquisition of Innovel were lower by one basis point. These decreases were offset by
an increase of five basis points related to a partial reversal of a product tax assessment in 2020, as well as an increase of four basis points
related to a write-off of certain information technology assets in the fourth quarter of 2021 that are no longer expected to be utilized as part of the
modernization of our information systems. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased our SG&A expenses by
approximately $228 in 2021.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents:
2021 2020 2019
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 8,958 $ 8,861 $ 6,356 
Net cash used in investing activities (3,535) (3,891) (2,865)
Net cash used in financing activities (6,488) (1,147) (1,147)
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash
and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $12,175 and $13,305 at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of these balances,
unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $1,816 and $1,636 at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. These
receivables generally settle within four days. Cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by a change in exchange rates of $46 and $70
in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and negatively impacted by $15 in 2019.
Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related
interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. See Notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements included
in Item 8 of this Report for amounts outstanding on August 29, 2021, related to debt and leases.
Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in
the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to the development and opening of new
and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months.

Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows as well as capacity under existing and available credit
agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and
projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $8,958 in 2021, compared to $8,861 in 2020. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily
from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse
operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also
includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise
inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to
accelerate delivery times, payment terms with our suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $3,535 in 2021, compared to $3,891 in 2020, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. In
2020, we acquired Innovel (Costco Wholesale Logistics) and a minority interest in Navitus. Net cash flows from investing activities also includes
purchases and maturities of short-term investments.
Capital Expenditures
Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required
for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In 2021, we spent $3,588 on
capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $3,800 to $4,200 during fiscal 2022. These expenditures are expected
to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 22 new warehouses,
including two relocations, in 2021, and plan to open approximately up to 35 additional new warehouses, including five relocations, in 2022. We
have experienced delays in real estate and construction activities due to COVID-19. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be
realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs or based on the current economic environment.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $6,488 in 2021, compared to $1,147 in 2020. Cash flows used in financing activities primarily related
to the payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock-based awards.
In 2020, we issued $4,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and repaid $3,200 of Senior Notes.
Stock Repurchase Programs
During 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 1,358,000 and 643,000 shares of common stock, at average prices of $364.39 and $308.45,
respectively, totaling approximately $495 and $198, respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the
accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases
are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1.
Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased
under our approved plan was $3,250 at the end of 2021.

Dividends
Cash dividends declared in 2021 totaled $12.98 per share, as compared to $2.70 per share in 2020. Dividends in 2021 included a special
dividend of $10.00 per share, resulting in an aggregate payment of approximately $4,430. In April 2021, the Board of Directors increased our
quarterly cash dividend from $0.70 to $0.79 per share.
Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At August 29, 2021, we had borrowing capacity under
these facilities of $1,050. Our international operations maintain $574 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $201 is
guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2021 were immaterial, and there
were none outstanding at the end of 2020.
The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $235. The outstanding commitments under these
facilities at the end of 2021 totaled $197, most of which were standby letters of credit which do not expire or have expiration dates within one
year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities.
The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of
credit outstanding.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or
future effect on our financial condition or financial statements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires
that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these
estimates. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8 of this Report.
Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities
Claims for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle
liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks
to seek to limit exposures arising from very large losses. We use different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive
insurance subsidiary, and participate in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are
estimated by using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are
highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims over
time. While we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims
and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.

Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions)
Our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in
speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various
instruments considered to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as
well as short-term investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date
of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our
short-term investments are in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations.
Our policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by
U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. government and government agency money market funds, and insured bank
balances. Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government
and government agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market
funds, bankers’ acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies.
A 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2021 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For
those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest
rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.
The nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end
of 2021, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $7,531. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See
Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.
Foreign Currency Risk
Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We
manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these
fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to
economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional
currency is other than the U.S. dollar. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative
transactions. For additional information related to the Company's forward foreign-exchange contracts, see Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-
functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2021, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $149 and resulted in an
unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount.

Commodity Price Risk
We are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and
manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities,
predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition
to some of the fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally
qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 29, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated October 5, 2021
expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Change in Accounting Principle
The Company changed its method of accounting for leases as of September 2, 2019, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-
02 – Leases (ASC 842).
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical
audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Evaluation of workers' compensation self-insurance liabilities
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering
historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated self-insurance
liabilities as of August 29, 2021 were $1,257 million, a portion of which related to workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the
United States operations.
We identified the evaluation of the Company’s workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the United States operations as a
critical audit matter because of the extent of specialized skill and knowledge needed to evaluate the underlying assumptions and
judgments made by the Company in the actuarial models. Specifically, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the
Company's selected loss rates and initial expected losses used in the actuarial models.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the
operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s self-insurance workers' compensation process. This included
controls related to the development and selection of the assumptions listed above used in the actuarial calculation and review of the
actuarial report. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:
• Assessing the actuarial models used by the Company for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards
• Evaluating the Company’s ability to estimate self-insurance workers' compensation liabilities by comparing its historical
estimates with actual incurred losses and paid losses
• Evaluating the above listed assumptions underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates by developing an independent
expectation of the self-insurance workers' compensation liabilities and comparing them to the amounts recorded by the
Company

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Costco Wholesale Corporation:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of August 29, 2021, based
on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 29, 2021,
based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of August 29, 2021 and August 30, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
equity, and cash flows for the 52-week periods ended August 29, 2021, August 30, 2020 and September 1, 2019, and the related notes (collectively,
the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated October 5, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data)
Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses
based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of
merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At August 29, 2021, Costco operated 815 warehouses
worldwide: 564 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 105 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 30 in Japan,
29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 16 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 12 in Australia, three in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The
Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a
controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the
Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been
eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise
noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.
Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2021, 2020,
and 2019 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 29, 2021, August 30, 2020, and September 1, 2019, respectively.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and
assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the
potential impacts arising from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could
differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at
the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card
receivables were $1,816 and $1,636 at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively.
41
Table of Contents
The Company provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as payments are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end
of 2021 and 2020, are $999 and $810, respectively, representing the excess of outstanding payments over cash on deposit at the banks on
which the payments were drawn.
Short-Term Investments
Short-term investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. Government and Agency Notes), with maturities at the date of purchase of
three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-
term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term
investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and
losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale
securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated
statements of income. These available-for-sale investments have a low level of inherent credit risk given they are issued by the U.S.
Government and Agencies. Changes in their fair value are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and market liquidity. Short-term
investments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are
reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis.
The Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for credit impairment, using both qualitative and quantitative
criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be impaired as the result of a credit loss, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income and
other, net in the consolidated statements of income.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash
and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See
Notes 3, 4, and 5 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of
observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are:
Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market
data.
Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such as
quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all
other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent external valuation information. The pricing process uses data from a variety
of independent external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves
including but not limited to treasury benchmarks and LIBOR or Secured Overnight Financing Rate and swap curves, discount rates, and market
data feeds. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports
transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair
42
Table of Contents
value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred.
Current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-term
debt, which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs,
and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based
primarily on reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit.
Receivables, Net
Receivables consist primarily of vendor, reinsurance, credit card incentive, third-party pharmacy and other receivables. Vendor receivables
include discounts and volume rebates. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due. In certain
circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presented on a
net basis. Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and primarily represent amounts
ceded through reinsurance arrangements gross of the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities
in the consolidated balance sheets. Credit card incentive receivables primarily represent amounts earned under the co-branded credit card
arrangement in the U.S. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’ insurers. Other receivables primarily
consist of amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items.
Receivables are recorded net of an allowance for credit losses which considers creditworthiness of vendors and third parties, historical
experience and current economic trends. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial in 2021, 2020, and 2019.
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories consist of the following:
2021 2020
United States $ 10,248 $ 8,871 
Canada 1,456 1,310 
Other International 2,511 2,061 
Merchandise inventories $ 14,215 $ 12,242 
Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting,
using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely
matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of
inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and
inventory levels have been determined. An immaterial charge was recorded to merchandise costs to increase the cumulative LIFO valuation on
merchandise inventories at August 29, 2021. As of August 30, 2020, U.S. merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated first-in, first-out
(FIFO) after considering the lower of cost or market principle. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly
valued using the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the FIFO basis.
The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts using estimates based on experience. The provision is
adjusted periodically to reflect physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where
appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided
that they are probable and reasonably estimable.
43
Table of Contents
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expense is computed primarily using the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements made after the beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably certain at the date the leasehold
improvements are made.
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. During development,
these costs are included in construction in progress. To the extent that the assets become ready for their intended use, these costs are included
in equipment and fixtures and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company
recognized an $84 write-off of certain information technology assets, which was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the
consolidated statements of income.
Repair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or
change the way an asset functions or that extend the useful life are capitalized. Assets removed during the remodel, refurbishment or
improvement are retired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of 2021 and 2020 were immaterial. The following table summarizes the
Company's property and equipment balances at the end of 2021 and 2020:
Estimated Useful Lives 2021 2020
Land N/A $ 7,507 $ 6,696 
Buildings and improvements 5-50 years 19,139 17,982

37,658 34,703 
Accumulated depreciation and amortization (14,166) (12,896)

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in
circumstances may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For asset
groups held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying
value. In the event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and
used equal to the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale
(disposal group), the carrying value is compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by
obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. Impairment charges recognized in 2021 were
immaterial. There were no impairment charges recognized in 2020 or 2019.
Leases
The Company leases land and/or buildings at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or
more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at
the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market value; or (c) a right of
first refusal in the event of a third-party offer.
44
Table of Contents
Some leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease
and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain
leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do
not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
The Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and
lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. The lease term is
defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the
option. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated
using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company
would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest
rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as described
in Property and Equipment, net above.
The Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that at the end of a lease must be removed.
These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term based upon the
estimated fair value of the costs to remove the improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the
obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the leasehold improvement assets and are included with
buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

Table of Contents
Definite-lived intangible assets, which are not material, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.
Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities
Claims for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle
liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks
to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The Company uses different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive
insurance subsidiary (the captive) and participates in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the
Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and
other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from
these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2021 and 2020, these insurance liabilities were $1,257 and $1,188 in the aggregate,
respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based
on their nature.
The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses,
in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party participants. The
reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the
commencement of the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program limit a participating members’
individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are
recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary
obligation to the policyholders for prior activity.
Derivatives
The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part,
through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known
future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory
expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts
do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to
engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding
contracts upon certain triggering events. There were no derivative instruments in a net liability position at the end of 2021 and for those in a net
liability position at the end of 2020, the amount needed to settle the instruments immediately if the credit-risk-related contingent features were
triggered was immaterial. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $1,331 and $1,036 at the
end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 4 for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of
2021 and 2020.
The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to
the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2021, 2020 and 2019.
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodity products used in retail
and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other
facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in
addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of
46
Table of Contents
derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no
mark-to-market adjustment.
Foreign Currency
The functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located.
Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Revenues and expenses of the Company’s consolidated foreign operations are translated at
average exchange rates prevailing during the year.
The Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income.
Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their
functional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These
items were immaterial in 2021, 2020, and 2019.
Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09 in 2019, which provided for changes in the recognition of revenue from
contracts with customers. The Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross
shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company
reserves for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The
Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current
assets, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods (previously hardlines and
softlines), and fresh foods. The Company also provides expanded products and services through warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The
majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is
generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed
as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses,
revenue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets.
The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it
has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally is established when Costco is primarily
responsible for merchandising decisions, maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction,
and has pricing discretion.
The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period.
Deferred membership fees at the end of 2021 and 2020 were $2,042 and $1,851, respectively.
In most countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum value,
which does not expire and can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of
the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated
balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2021, 2020, and 2019, the net reduction in sales
was $2,047, $1,707, and $1,537 respectively.
47
Table of Contents
The Company sells and otherwise provides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for
merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on
redemption data. The Company accounts for outstanding shop card balances as a shop card liability, net of estimated breakage. Shop card
liabilities are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
Citibank, N.A. became the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members in June 2016. The Company receives various forms of
consideration, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco, a portion of which, after giving rise to estimated breakage,
is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receive. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. Breakage is estimated
based on redemption data.
Merchandise Costs
Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs
related to the Company’s depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced
by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods and certain ancillary
departments.
Vendor Consideration
The Company has agreements to receive funds from vendors for discounts and a variety of other programs. These programs are evidenced by
signed agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the
rebate or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a
reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers’ compensation costs for warehouse employees
(other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses which are reflected in merchandise costs) as well as all regional and home
office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment
depreciation, stock compensation expense, credit and debit card processing fees, utilities, as well as other operating costs incurred to support
warehouse and e-commerce website operations.
Retirement Plans
The Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have completed 90 days of employment. The
plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each
eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. The Company also has a defined contribution plan for Canadian employees and
contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit
and defined contribution plans, which are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $748, $676, and $614 for 2021, 2020, and 2019,
respectively, and are predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
Stock-Based Compensation
RSUs granted to employees generally vest over five years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based awards that
would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. Actual forfeitures are recognized as they
occur.
48
Table of Contents
Compensation expense for stock-based awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for
the entire award. Awards for employees and non-employee directors provide for accelerated vesting based on cumulative years of service with
the Company. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service term. The cumulative
amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at
that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the
expected dividends forgone during the vesting period.
Stock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
income. Certain stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 8 for additional information on
the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.
Preopening Expenses
Preopening expenses include startup costs for new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing
and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses and corporate facilities and are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation
allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.
The timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment.
The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-
than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the
Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes as appropriate.
Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco
The computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The
computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the
number of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock
method for shares subject to RSUs.
Stock Repurchase Programs
Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased
shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital
and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding
and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 7 for additional
information.

Note 2—Acquisition of Innovel
On March 17, 2020, the Company acquired Innovel Solutions for $999, using existing cash and cash equivalents. Innovel (now known as Costco
Wholesale Logistics or CWL) provides final-mile delivery, installation and white-glove capabilities for big and bulky products in the United States
and Puerto Rico. Its financial results have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
The net purchase price of $999 has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets of $294 and liabilities assumed of $235, based on fair
values on the acquisition date. The remaining unallocated net purchase price of $940 was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the
acquisition's benefits to the Company, which include the ability to serve more members and improve delivery times, enabling growth in certain
segments of our U.S. e-commerce operations. The Company assigned this goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, to reporting units
within the U.S. segment. Changes to the purchase price allocation originally recorded in 2020 were not material.

value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between levels during 2021 or 2020.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at
amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. Fair value adjustments
to nonfinancial assets during 2021 were immaterial and there were no fair value adjustments to these items during 2020.
Note 5—Debt
Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,050 and $967, in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Borrowings on these short-term facilities were immaterial during 2021 and 2020. Short-term borrowings outstanding were $41 at the end of
2021. There were no outstanding balances at the end of 2020.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, the holder has the right to require the Company to purchase this security at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of the event. Interest on all outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior
Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In June
2021, the Japanese subsidiary repaid approximately $94 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.(1)

In April 2020, the Company issued $4,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes as follows: $1,250 of 1.375% due June 2027; $1,750 of
1.600% due April 2030; and $1,000 of 1.750% due April 2032. In May 2020, a portion of the proceeds from the issuance were used to repay,
prior to maturity, the outstanding $1,000 and $500 principal balances and interest on the 2.150% and 2.250% Senior Notes, respectively. The
early redemption resulted in a $36 charge which was recorded in interest income and other, net in 2020.
At the end of 2021 and 2020, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $7,692 and

Dividends
Cash dividends declared in 2021 totaled $12.98 per share, as compared to $2.70 per share in 2020. Dividends in 2021 included a special
dividend of $10.00 per share, resulting in an aggregate payment of approximately $4,430. The Company's current quarterly dividend rate is
$0.79 per share.
Stock Repurchase Programs
The Company's stock repurchase program is conducted under a $4,000 authorization by the Board of Directors, which expires in April 2023. As
of the end of 2021, the remaining amount available under the approved plan was $3,250. The following table summarizes the Company’s stock

These amounts may differ from repurchases of common stock in the consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock
repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block
purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1.
Note 8—Stock-Based Compensation
The Company grants stock-based compensation, primarily to employees and non-employee directors. Grants to all executive officers are
generally performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions
implemented by the Company. RSUs are subject to quarterly vesting upon retirement or voluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25
years of service with the Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date. The 2019 Incentive Plan
authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were
available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate of 27,800,000 shares
(15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered
to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
In conjunction with a special cash dividend paid in the second quarter of 2021, and in accordance with the plans, the number of shares subject to
outstanding RSUs was increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of
outstanding shares by a factor of 1.019 (rounded up to a whole share), representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $391.77 on
November 30, 2020, which was the last trading day immediately prior to the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $384.50 on the ex-
dividend date, December 1, 2020. The outstanding RSUs increased by approximately 94,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-
based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not change. As further required by the plans, the maximum number of shares
issuable was proportionally adjusted, which resulted in an additional 220,000 RSU shares available to be granted.

Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
RSUs granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five and three years, respectively. Additionally, the terms of the
RSUs, including performance-based awards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25 or
more and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and
undelivered shares. At the end of 2021, 12,001,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs under the 2019 Incentive Plan.
The following awards were outstanding at the end of 2021:
•4,218,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
•131,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 104,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2021. This determination occurred in September 2021, at which time at least 33% of the units vested, as a result
of the long service of all executive officers. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time.

Except for certain provisions, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act) was effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Most
provisions became effective for the Company for 2019, including limitations on the ability to claim foreign tax credits, repeal of the domestic
manufacturing deduction, and limitations on certain business deductions. Provisions with significant impacts that were effective starting in the
second quarter of 2018 and throughout 2019 included: a lower U.S. federal income tax rate, remeasurement of certain net deferred tax liabilities,
and a transition tax on deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings. The lower U.S. tax rate of 21.0% was effective for all of 2021, 2020, and
2019.
The reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:

During 2019, the Company recognized net tax benefits of $123 related to the 2017 Tax Act. This benefit included $105 related to U.S. taxation of
deemed foreign dividends, partially offset by losses of current year foreign tax credits.
The Company recognized total net tax benefits of $163, $81 and $221 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These include benefits of $75, $77
and $59, respectively, related to the stock-based compensation accounting standard adopted in 2018, in addition to the impacts of the 2017 Tax
Act noted above. During 2021, there was a net tax benefit of $70 related to the portion of the special dividend paid through our 401(k) plan.
The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
2021 2020
Deferred tax assets:
Equity compensation $ 72 $ 80

Total deferred tax liabilities (1,987) (1,950)
       Net deferred tax liabilities $ (310)$ (259)
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2021 and 2020 include deferred income tax assets of $444 and $406, respectively, included in other
long-term assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $754 and $665, respectively, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2021 and 2020, the Company had valuation allowances of $214 and $105, respectively, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the
Company believes will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carry forwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal
2030.
The Company no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries after 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested (other than
China) and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes
payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The Company continues to consider undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S.
consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,070, to be indefinitely reinvested and has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2021 and 2020 is as follows:
2021 2020
Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 30 $ 27 
Gross increases—current year tax positions 2 1 
Gross increases—tax positions in prior years 2 8 
Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years — (3)
Lapse of statute of limitations (1) (3)
Gross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 33 $ 30 
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2021 and 2020, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $30 and $28 at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2021 and 2020, and accrued at the end of each respective period were not material.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2017. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company reached
an agreement on a product tax audit resulting in a benefit of $84. The Company recorded a charge of $123 in 2019 regarding this matter. Other
possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these examinations are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range
of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a
charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year.

Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance
with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss
contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The
Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable
indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as
appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in
addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably
estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss
contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss
in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in
excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties
sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or
novel legal theories or a large number of parties.
The Company is a defendant in an action commenced in August 2013 under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA)
alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to employees who work at entrance and exit doors in California
warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief
under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of
the complaint.
In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees in California did not receive suitable seating or
reasonably comfortable workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. CIVDS 1908816; San Bernardino
Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In October 2019, the parties reached an
agreement to settle for an immaterial amount the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in February 2020. The
workplace temperature claims continue in litigation.

material allegations of the complaint. In June 2021, the plaintiff agreed to dismiss his claims for failure to provide meal and rest breaks and to
pay minimum wages. In July 2021, the parties reached an agreement settling for an immaterial amount the remaining claim and related
derivative claims.

under California law for failure to pay all wages at termination and for Labor Code penalties under PAGA. Kristy v. Costco Wholesale Corp.
(Case No. 5:20-cv-04119; N.D. Cal.). The case was stayed due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy, and his individual claim was settled for an immaterial
amount. A request for dismissal of the class and representative action is pending.
In July 2020, an employee filed an action under PAGA on behalf of all California non-exempt employees alleging violations of California Labor
Code provisions regarding meal and rest periods, minimum wage, overtime, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, and payment of

On June 23, 2020, a putative class action was filed against the Company, the “Board of Directors,” the “Costco Benefits Committee” and others
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Dustin S. Soulek v.
Costco Wholesale, et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-937. The class is alleged to be beneficiaries of the Costco 401(k) plan from June 23, 2014, and the
claims are that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in the operation and oversight of the plan. The complaint seeks injunctive relief,
damages, interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. On September 11, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and on
September 21 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the defendants have also moved to dismiss.
The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all
of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year.

Note 12—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, U.K., Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France, and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable
segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial
performance, which considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment
net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly
stock-based compensation, incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, are included in the U.S.
operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of U.S. management.

are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and to ensure that information required
to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely
decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management,
have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 29, 2021 and, based on their evaluation, have
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies
and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the
dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of August 29, 2021, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 29, 2021. The
attestation of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is
included with the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that
occurred during the fourth quarter of 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.
