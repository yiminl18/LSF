CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and Johnson & Johnson's other publicly available documents contain "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson
and its subsidiaries (the "Company") also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to
historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements
may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with,
among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and
dispositions; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to
uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if
underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition
could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to
rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition
•Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s
continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer
access, and initial and continued commercial success;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and
technologies in the U.S. and other important markets;
•The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing biosimilars and generics and resulting revenue and market share
losses;
•Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar
or other products, and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges,
potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product;
•Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process
obsolescence;
•Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies;
•Competition on the basis of cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and
•Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the
Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.
Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity
•Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action
on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales and reputational damage;
•Impact of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to
pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;
•Increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which
carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business;
•Failure to meet compliance obligations in the McNEIL-PPC, Inc. Consent Decree or the Corporate Integrity Agreements of the Johnson & Johnson
Pharmaceutical Affiliates, or any other compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions;
•Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting U.S. and international operations, including relating to: approval of new products;
licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of health care products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, health care products and
services; environmental protection and sourcing of raw materials;
•Changes in tax laws and regulations, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially
in excess of reserves; and
•Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives and Health Care Market Trends
•Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward health care cost containment, including the continued consolidation among health care providers, trends
toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of health care expenses, and significant new entrants to
the health care markets seeking to reduce costs;
•Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of health care products and services due to economic hardship
and budgetary constraints;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development
collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to
competitive pressures;
•The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company,
including the integration of Actelion Ltd., may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; and
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and future restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to
realize than expected, including due to any required consultation procedures relating to restructuring of workforce.
Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally
•Impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and
resulting margins;
•Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the U.S., U.K. and other countries, including any increased trade
restrictions and potential drug reimportation legislation;
•The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental
controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems;
•Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company's products and services, cause disruptions
in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and
integrity of the Company's products and operations; and
•The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the U.S. and other parts of the world including social and economic disruptions and instability of
financial and other markets.
Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations
•Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally or within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or
shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action;
•Interruptions and breaches of the Company's information technology systems, and those of the Company's vendors, could result in reputational,
competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action; and
•Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that
may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products.
Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks that
could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should
understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete
statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made
from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments.
PART I
Item 1. BUSINESS
General
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,000 employees worldwide engaged in the research and
development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, which has more than
260 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and
well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the
resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical
and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating
companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business
segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located.
Segments of Business
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this
item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Report; and Note 18 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Consumer
The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s
health and wound care markets. Baby Care includes the JOHNSON’S® line of products. Oral Care includes the LISTERINE® product line. Major brands in
Beauty include the AVEENO®; CLEAN & CLEAR®; DABAO™; JOHNSON’S® Adult; LE PETITE MARSEILLAIS®; NEUTROGENA®; RoC® and
OGX® product lines. Over-the-counter medicines include the broad family of TYLENOL® acetaminophen products; SUDAFED® cold, flu and allergy
products; BENADRYL® and ZYRTEC® allergy products; MOTRIN® IB ibuprofen products; and the PEPCID® line of acid reflux products. Major brands
in Women’s Health outside of North America are STAYFREE® and CAREFREE® sanitary pads and o.b.® tampon brands. Wound Care brands include the
BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages and NEOSPORIN® First Aid product lines. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to
retail outlets and distributors throughout the world.
Pharmaceutical
The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas: Immunology (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and
psoriasis), Infectious Diseases and Vaccines (e.g., HIV/AIDS), Neuroscience (e.g., mood disorders and schizophrenia), Oncology (e.g., prostate cancer and
hematologic malignancies), Cardiovascular and Metabolism (e.g., thrombosis and diabetes) and Pulmonary Hypertension (e.g., Pulmonary Arterial
Hypertension), a new therapeutic area, which was established with the acquisition of Actelion in June 2017. Medicines in this segment are distributed
directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include:
REMICADE® (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI® (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment for
adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active
ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab), an intravenous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis; STELARA®

treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma; ZYTIGA® (abiraterone
                
 1
                                
acetate), used in combination with prednisone as a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib), an oral, once-
daily therapy approved for use in treating certain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers, and Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia; DARZALEX®

INVOKAMET®/VOKANAMET® (canagliflozin/metformin HCl), a combination therapy of fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride for
the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; and INVOKAMET® XR (canagliflozin/metformin hydrochloride extended-release), a once-daily, fixed-dose
combination therapy of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; OPSUMIT®
(macitentan) as monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI® (selexipag),
the only approved oral, selective IP receptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration
with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs.
Medical Devices
The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and eye health
fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals,
eye care professionals and clinics. They include orthopaedic products; general surgery, biosurgical, endomechanical and energy products; electrophysiology
products to treat cardiovascular disease; sterilization and disinfection products to reduce surgical infection; diabetes care products, such as blood glucose
monitoring; and vision care products such as disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to cataract and laser refractive surgery.
Geographic Areas
The business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by more than 260 operating companies located in more than 60 countries, including the U.S.,
which sell products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those
described above under “– Segments of Business – Consumer,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products and
methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those
developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.
Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment
and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system
uncertainties.
Raw Materials
Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the
temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.
Patents
The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are
licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing
processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries
face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key
pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the
Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Sales of the Company’s largest product, REMICADE® (infliximab), accounted for approximately 8.3% of the Company's total net trade sales for
fiscal 2017.
There are two sets of patents related specifically to REMICADE®. The first set of patents is co-owned by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYU). Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to NYU's interests in the
patents. These patents have expired in all countries outside the United States. In the United States, the one remaining patent, which expires in September
2018, stands rejected following
                
 2
                                
reexamination proceedings instituted by a third party in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The patent has also been held invalid by
the Federal District Court in the District of Massachusetts. In January 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the invalidity of the
remaining patent.
The second set of patents specifically related to REMICADE® was granted to The Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology in Europe, Canada,
Australia and the United States. Janssen Biotech, Inc. has licenses (exclusive for human anti-TNF antibodies and semi-exclusive for non-human anti-TNF
antibodies) to these patents, which expired in 2017 outside of the United States and will expire in August 2018 in the United States. Certain of these patents
have been successfully challenged and invalidated, and others are under review in various patent offices around the world and are also subject to litigation
in Canada.
The Company does not expect that any extensions will be available for the above described patents specifically related to REMICADE®. In the
United States, a biosimilar version of REMICADE® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. For a more extensive
description of legal matters regarding the patents related to REMICADE®, see Note 21 “Legal Proceedings – Intellectual Property – Pharmaceutical –
REMICADE® Related Cases” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
In addition to competing in the immunology market with REMICADE®, the Company is currently marketing STELARA® (ustekinumab),
SIMPONI® (golimumab), SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab) and TREMFYA® (guselkumab), next generation immunology products with remaining patent
lives of up to six years.
Trademarks
The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by
all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company
considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.
Seasonality
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.
Competition
In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines
without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the
development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative
products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of
its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of
customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Research and Development
Research activities represent a significant part of the Company’s businesses. Research and development expenditures relate to the processes of
discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product
efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering
high quality and innovative products. Worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to $10.6 billion, $9.1 billion and $9.0 billion for
fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Research facilities are located in the United States, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany,
Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional R&D support in over 30 other countries.
Environment
The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations
comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements did not change
during the past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.
                
 3
                                
Regulation
The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the
general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by
various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation
required for FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in
major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe are examples of such increased
regulation.
The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and
legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write
prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market
place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of
health care generally.
U.S. government agencies continue to implement the extensive requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA). These
have both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the ACA, and
potential modification or repeal of ACA provisions, will ultimately affect the industry.
The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product
withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate
product recalls.
In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government
agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing
regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from Brexit, that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of
materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
The Company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. In
addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below.
Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all
potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition
could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.
The Company’s largest product, REMICADE® (infliximab), is experiencing biosimilar competition, which will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of
REMICADE®.
The Company has experienced significant challenges to patents covering its largest product, REMICADE® (infliximab) (accounting for approximately
8.3% of the Company’s total net trade sales for fiscal 2017), and continues to assert certain patents related to the product. In the United States, a biosimilar
version of REMICADE® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Sales of infliximab biosimilars in the U.S.
market will result in a continued reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®.
Global sales in the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing
pricing pressures.
Sales of the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government
healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting
downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the United States, increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of
Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in further pricing
pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. Outside the United States, numerous major markets,
including the EU and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls,
limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.
The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage.
In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as
patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or
consumer protection laws. The most significant of these proceedings are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict
the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these
matters, potentially in excess of accruals. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. Furthermore, as a result of cost and availability factors,
effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance.
Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and
cause reputational damage.
Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence,
can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or its counterpart in other countries),
private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to
brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government
investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation
costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.
Changes in tax laws or regulations could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. On December 22, 2017, the U.S.
enacted The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA), which resulted in the revaluation of the Company’s U.S. related deferred tax assets and liabilities and had
an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The TCJA introduces significant changes to U.S. corporate income tax law that will have
a meaningful impact on the
                
 5
                                
Company’s provision for income taxes. Accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA requires significant judgments to be made in interpreting its
provisions. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the TCJA, the Company made reasonable
estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in the financial statements for fiscal year 2017. These provisional amounts are based on the
Company’s initial analysis of the TCJA as of January 18, 2018. Anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the TCJA, and the
potential for additional guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Accounting Standards Board related to the TCJA, may
result in adjustments to these estimates which could materially affect the Company’s financial position and results of operations as well as the effective tax
rate in the period in which the adjustments are made.
The government in Switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation, which could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate if
enacted into law.
The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In
connection with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, companies are required to
disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries.
The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax
authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.
The Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the Company’s businesses.
The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, determined by patent offices, courts and lawmakers in various
countries, relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the
Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights.
The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the U.S. and other important markets or
that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.
Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences,
oppositions and other proceedings. These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the
Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the
competitive position and sales of the products in question.
The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the
Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the United States, manufacturers of
generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the
Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the FDA. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010,
which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created
mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The inter partes review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created
under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the Company’s subsidiaries. For example, the key
patent for ZYTIGA® is currently subject to patent litigation, and the USPTO has issued a decision invalidating that patent in a related IPR action.
In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent
infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a
very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 21, “Legal
Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s
earnings.
The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company’s businesses compete with
companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived
product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to
acquisitions, collaborations and licensing
                
 6
                                
agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and
onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and
other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing
products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development.
For the Company’s pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors
gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for
a biological product. For the Company’s medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are
especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make
the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s consumer businesses face intense competition from
other branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products,
this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.
Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an
adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.
The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the
evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue
losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products
introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 22% of 2017 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to
develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval,
and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.
The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and
licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology
products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development
programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care providers’
future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property
protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company’s products from
competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the
marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or
uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and
efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.
The Company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government
investigations, legal actions and penalties.
Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action, by national, state and local
government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with Good Manufacturing
Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines
and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing,
pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Increased scrutiny of
health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and
prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare
programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current
investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings” under Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
                
 7
                                
The Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally.
The Company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial, economic and political risks, including
those listed below.
Foreign Currency Exchange: In fiscal 2017, approximately 48% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 22% in Europe,
8% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency
exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the
U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are
translated into U.S. dollars.
Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks: The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high
inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed
100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price
increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing
high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.
Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products: The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or
other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the
Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal
under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced
imports has grown significantly.
Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with
respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded
companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the
purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore
involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human
pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s
interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the
FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and
penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal
proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health
care programs.
Other Legal, Social and Political Risks. Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include:
•protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements;
•compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture
or sell its products in the relevant market;
•diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;
•potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets; and
•disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, social upheavals or pandemics.
Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and reputation.
The Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The
Company's subsidiaries operate 125 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the
past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing
disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents
(such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest and terrorist attacks. Such
                
 8
                                
delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and
related costs associated with addressing the shortage.
An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation
To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their
vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data
that may be subject to legal protection. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the
security and availability of these IT systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company
continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the
Company’s third party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact
to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with
the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in
reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action.

The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition.
McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the
FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the "Consent Decree"). Following FDA inspections in 2015,
McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, and
commercial production has restarted.
Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three
facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times
until at least 2020.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Organization and Business Segments
Description of the Company and Business Segments
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,000 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development,
manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the
primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad
range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are
marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six
therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices
segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields which are distributed to
wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the
resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business
segments.
In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product
lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the
improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as
protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for
the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Management’s Objectives
With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for
humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this
common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes.
The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products
and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 22% of 2017 sales. In 2017, $10.6 billion was invested in
research and development and $35.2 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create
value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.
A critical driver of the Company’s success, is the 134,000 diverse employees that work across more than 260 operating companies, which are located
in more than 60 countries. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every
employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive
resources across the enterprise, enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on
addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare
professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.

Results of Operations
Analysis of Consolidated Sales
In 2017, worldwide sales increased 6.3% to $76.5 billion, compared to an increase of 2.6% in 2016 and a decrease of 5.7% in 2015. These sales changes
consisted of the following:
Sales increase/(decrease) due to:  2017  2016  2015
Volume  8.0 % 3.2% 1.2 %
Price  (2.0) 0.7 0.6
Currency  0.3  (1.3) (7.5)
Total  6.3 % 2.6% (5.7)%
In 2017, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a positive impact of 3.6%. In 2016, acquisitions and divestitures
had a negative impact of 1.1% on the worldwide sales growth and competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD®
(simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 0.8% on the worldwide sales growth. Operations in Venezuela negatively impacted the
worldwide sales growth 0.3%. In 2015, the introduction of competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD®
(simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 2.7% on the worldwide sales growth. In 2015, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures
on the worldwide sales growth was negative 2.0%.
Sales by U.S. companies were $39.9 billion in 2017, $37.8 billion in 2016 and $35.7 billion in 2015. This represents increases of 5.4% in 2017, 6.0%
in 2016 and 2.6% in 2015. Sales by international companies were $36.6 billion in 2017, $34.1 billion in 2016 and $34.4 billion in 2015. This represents an
increase of 7.4% in 2017, and decreases of 0.9% in 2016, and 13.1% in 2015.
The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.6%, 6.0% and (0.4)%, respectively. The ten-year
compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.3%, 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively.
In 2017, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 8.6% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 7.2% and a positive
currency impact of 1.4%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) achieved growth of 5.4% as compared to the prior year,
including operational growth of 2.8% and a positive currency impact of 2.6%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region achieved growth of
6.7% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 7.5% partially offset by a negative currency impact of 0.8%.
The 2016 sales growth percentage as compared to the prior year was negatively impacted by approximately 1.3% from additional shipping days in
2015. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). While the additional week in 2015 added a few days to sales,
it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.
In 2017, the Company had two wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 14.0% and 10.0% of the total
consolidated revenues. In 2016, the Company had two wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 13.5% and
10.7% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2015, the Company had one wholesaler distributing products for all three segments that represented
approximately 12.5% of the total consolidated revenues.

competitive pressure partially offset by new product launches outside the U.S.
The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.1 billion in 2017, a decrease of 1.6% as compared to the prior year, primarily due to category declines in
EMEA and share loss in Brazil.
The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.8 billion in 2017, a decrease of 2.3% as compared to the prior year, primarily due to private label
competitive pressure in the U.S. partially offset by BAND-AID® new product launches outside the U.S.
Consumer segment sales in 2016 were $13.3 billion, a decrease of 1.5% from 2015, which included 1.5% operational growth offset by a negative
currency impact of 3.0%. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.4 billion, an increase of 3.8%. International sales were $7.9 billion, a decrease of 4.8%,

Immunology products achieved sales of $12.2 billion in 2017, representing an increase of 2.3% as compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by
strong uptake of STELARA® (ustekinumab), the launch of TREMFYA® (guselkumab) and sales growth of SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab)
outside the U.S. Lower sales of REMICADE® (infliximab) were due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition.
The patents for REMICADE® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been
introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets. Additional biosimilar
competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version of
REMICADE® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S.
market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®. The Company continues to assert REMICADE® related patent rights. See Note 21
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE® patents.
Infectious disease products sales were $3.2 billion, a decline of 1.7% from 2016. Lower sales of OLYSIO® (simeprevir), vaccines and PREZISTA®
(darunavir/cobicistat) were partially offset by sales growth of EDURANT®/rilpivirine, PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® and the launch of SYMTUZA®.
Neuroscience products sales were $6.0 billion, a decrease of 1.6% from 2016. Lower sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone) and
CONCERTA®/methylphenidate as well as the impact of divestitures were partially offset by strong sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION®/
TRINZA®/TREVICTA®(paliperidone palmitate) long-acting injectables.
Oncology products achieved sales of $7.3 billion in 2017, representing an increase of 25.0% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth
of Oncology products were strong sales of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) and IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) driven by market share and market growth and
sales of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) driven by market growth. Several generic companies are challenging the remaining patent for ZYTIGA® in the
USPTO and in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company is appealing a decision by the USPTO invalidating this patent,
and the parties are awaiting a decision on a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement filed by the generic companies. In the event that the rulings
are unfavorable to the Company, a generic launch is expected to follow. If there is a launch of a generic version of ZYTIGA® following FDA approval, it
will result in a reduction in U.S. sales, and such reduction could occur in a short period of time. In 2017, the Company reported U.S. sales of $1.2 billion
for ZYTIGA®. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding ZYTIGA®.
Pulmonary Hypertension is a new therapeutic area which was established with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd on June 16, 2017. See Note 20 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the acquisition.
Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $6.3 billion, a decline of 1.7% as compared to the prior year attributable to lower sales of
INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin) in the U.S. primarily due to an increase in price discounts and market share decline driven by competitive
pressure. This was partially offset by sales growth of XARELTO®(rivaroxaban) due to increased market growth and market share, as well as sales of non-
PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) products from the Actelion acquisition.

Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2016 were $33.5 billion, an increase of 6.5% from 2015, which included operational growth of 7.4% partially offset
by a negative currency impact of 0.9%. U.S. sales were $20.1 billion, an increase of 9.8%. International sales were $13.3 billion, an increase of 1.8%,
which included 4.0% operational growth partially offset by a negative currency impact of 2.2%. In 2016, acquisitions, divestitures and competitive
products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 2.5% on the
operational growth of the Pharmaceutical segment. In 2016, the Pharmaceutical segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 1.5% due to
additional shipping days in 2015. The Pharmaceutical segment operational growth for 2016, as compared to the prior year, was not impacted by
adjustments to previous reserve estimates as both periods included approximately $0.5 billion of adjustments.

The Surgery franchise sales were $9.6 billion in 2017, an increase of 2.8% from 2016. Growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by
endocutter, energy, including the acquisition of Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., and biosurgery products. Growth in General Surgery was primarily
driven by sutures and sales from the acquisition of Torax Medical, Inc. The sales decline in Specialty Surgery was primarily due to lower sales of aesthetic,
Advanced Sterilization and Sterilmed products.
The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $9.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of 0.8% from 2016. The decline in Spine & Other was primarily due to the
Codman Neurosurgery divestiture, share loss in U.S. Spine, pricing and competitive pressures. This was partially offset by sales growth of trauma, sports
medicine products and U.S. hips.
The Vision Care franchise achieved sales of $4.1 billion in 2017, an increase of 45.9% from 2016. Growth was driven by sales from the acquisition of
AMO, with the majority of AMO sales in the surgical category, and new product launches in the contact lenses category.
The Cardiovascular franchise sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of 13.4% from 2016. Strong growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by
market growth and continued uptake of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® Contact Force Sensing Catheter.
The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 9.7% from 2016. The decline was primarily due to price declines and competitive
pressures. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company announced its decision to exit the Animas insulin pump business. Animas has selected
Medtronic plc to facilitate a seamless transition for patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. The Company is continuing to evaluate potential strategic
options for LifeScan, Inc. and determine the best opportunity to drive future growth and maximize shareholder value.
The Medical Devices segment sales in 2016 were $25.1 billion, a decrease of 0.1% from 2015, which included an operational increase of 0.9% and a
negative currency impact of 1.0%. U.S. sales were $12.3 billion, an increase of 1.1% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $12.9 billion, a
decrease of 1.2% as compared to the prior year, with an operational increase of 0.7% and a negative currency impact of 1.9%. In 2016, acquisitions and
divestitures had a negative
                
 21
                                
impact of 1.8% on the worldwide operational growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2015. In 2016, the Medical Devices segment
operational growth was negatively impacted by 0.9% due to additional shipping days in 2015.
Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income
Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income decreased to $17.7 billion in 2017, as compared to $19.8 billion in 2016, a decrease of 10.8%.
The decrease was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense and other charges related to recent acquisitions, higher selling, marketing and
administrative costs due to investments in new product launches and higher research and development costs due to general portfolio progression and
collaborations.
Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $19.8 billion in 2016, as compared to $19.2 billion in 2015, an increase of
3.2%. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volume, favorable mix in the business and lower selling, marketing and administrative costs.
This was partially offset by higher net litigation expense of $0.7 billion and a higher restructuring charge of $0.1 billion as compared to 2015. Additionally,
the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains on the sale of assets/businesses as compared to 2016.
As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2017 was 23.1% versus 27.5% in 2016.
Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses:  Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses
as a percent to sales were as follows:
% of Sales  2017  2016  2015
Cost of products sold  33.2% 30.2% 30.7
Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  3.0 (0.5) 0.1
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses  28.0% 27.7% 30.3
Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  0.3 (2.6) 0.8
In 2017, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.2% from 30.2% as compared to the same period a year ago. The unfavorable increase
was primarily driven by $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and charges for inventory step-up related to the recent acquisitions, primarily Actelion.
Intangible asset amortization expense of $3.0 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2017 as compared to $1.2 billion in 2016. There was an
increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to investments in new
product launches partially offset by favorable mix.
In 2016, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased to 30.2% from 30.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. Favorable mix in the
business and cost improvement programs was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of transactional currency. Intangible asset amortization expense of
$1.2 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2016 and 2015. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative
expenses in 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to cost management in all the segments and favorable mix.
Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows:
  2017  2016  2015
(Dollars in Millions)  Amount  % of Sales* Amount  % of Sales* Amount % of Sales*
Consumer  $ 584 4.3% $ 580 4.4% 625 4.6
Pharmaceutical  8,360 23.1 6,967 20.8 6,821 21.7
Medical Devices  1,610 6.1 1,548 6.2 1,600 6.4
Total research and development expense  $ 10,554 13.8% $ 9,095 12.7% 9,046 12.9
Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year  16.0%   0.5%   6.5  
* As a percent to segment sales
Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering,
testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory
compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and
innovative products. In 2017, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 16.0% compared to 2016. The increase as a percent of
sales was primarily in the pharmaceutical segment due to general portfolio progression as well as collaborative agreements entered into with Idorsia Ltd.
and Legend Biotech. In 2016, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 0.5% compared to
                
 22
                                
2015 but decreased as a percent of sales. The decrease as a percent of sales was attributable to higher overall sales in the Pharmaceutical segment. The
increased dollar spend in the Pharmaceutical segment was for investment spending to advance the pipeline.
In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In 2017, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion primarily for the discontinuation of
certain development projects related to Novira which was acquired in 2015. The product development was canceled due to safety concerns. In 2016, the
Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $29 million for the discontinuation of a development program related to Crucell. In 2015, the Company recorded
an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Covagen.
Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down
of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), gains and losses on divestitures, transactional
currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense,
net for the fiscal year 2017 was a favorable change of $0.3 billion due to higher gains of $0.7 billion on the sale of assets/businesses, primarily the Codman
Neurosurgery and COMPEED® divestitures, a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion
related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by higher litigation expense of $0.4
billion, $0.3 billion of acquisition costs related to Actelion and AMO, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump
business and a higher restructuring related charge of $0.2 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2016.
The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2016 was an unfavorable change of $2.5 billion as compared to the prior year primarily
due to higher gains on the sale of assets/businesses in the fiscal year 2015 as compared to 2016. The fiscal year of 2016 included gains of $0.6 billion from
the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business, certain anesthetic products in Europe and certain non-strategic Consumer brands
versus gains of $2.6 billion recorded in 2015 primarily from the divestiture of the Cordis business, the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA® and the SPLENDA®
brand. Additionally, the fiscal year of 2016 included higher litigation expense of $0.7 billion as compared to 2015. This was partially offset by a $0.3
billion intangible asset write-down related to Acclarent included in the fiscal year 2015.
Interest (Income) Expense:  Interest income in 2017 increased slightly as compared to 2016 due to higher average interest rates partially offset by lower
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during the period. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $18.3 billion at the
end of 2017, and averaged $30.1 billion as compared to the $40.1 billion average cash balance in 2016. The decrease in the balance of cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, primarily the Actelion acquisition
for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired.
Interest expense in 2017 was higher as compared to 2016. The average debt balance was $30.9 billion in 2017 versus $23.5 billion in 2016. The total
debt balance at the end of 2017 was $34.6 billion as compared to $27.1 billion at the end of 2016. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.5 billion
was primarily due to increased borrowings. The Company increased borrowings in February and November of 2017, capitalizing on favorable terms in the
capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, including the completion of the stock repurchase program.
Interest income in 2016 increased by $0.2 billion as compared to 2015 due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities and higher interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $41.9 billion at the end of 2016, and averaged $40.1 billion as
compared to the $35.7 billion average cash balance in 2015.
Interest expense in 2016 was higher as compared to 2015. The average debt balance was $23.5 billion in 2016 versus $19.3 billion in 2015. The total
debt balance at the end of 2016 was $27.1 billion as compared to $19.9 billion at the end of 2015. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.2 billion
was primarily due to increased borrowings in February and May of 2016. The Company increased borrowings, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital
markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program.

(2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense.
Increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher interest expense of $0.2 billion on higher debt balance.
 
Consumer Segment: In 2017, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.6%, versus 18.3% in 2016. The increase in the
income before tax as a percent of sales in 2017 as compared to 2016 was attributable to higher gains on divestitures, primarily the divestiture of
COMPEED® in 2017. This was partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year due to increased
advertising and promotional spending and slightly higher amortization expense in 2017 related to acquisitions. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 was
negatively impacted by operations in Venezuela.
 In 2016, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.3%, versus 13.2% in 2015, primarily driven by favorable selling,
marketing and administrative expenses due to cost management and higher gross profit margins from cost improvement projects and favorable mix. This
was partially offset by higher gains in 2015 related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the SPLENDA® brand. Additionally, operations in Venezuela
negatively impacted the Consumer segment income before tax in 2016 as compared to 2015.
Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2017, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.6% versus 38.3% in 2016. The decrease in
the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other costs related to the Actelion
acquisition, higher research and development expense, a higher IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion related to Novira and lower gains on divestitures as
compared to the prior year. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 included a positive adjustment of $0.5 billion to previous reserve estimates. This was partially
offset by a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables, a higher gain of $0.2 billion related to the sale of certain investments in
equity securities and favorable product mix in 2017.
In 2016, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 38.3% versus 37.3% in 2015. The increase in income before tax was
primarily due to strong sales volume growth and favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses due to cost management. Additionally, the fiscal
year 2015, had higher gains of $0.7 billion related to divestitures partially offset by a higher IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion as compared to 2016. The fiscal
year of 2016 included the gains from the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business and certain anesthetic products in Europe
versus the gains recorded in 2015 from the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA®.
Medical Devices Segment: In 2017, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.3% versus 22.2% in 2016. The decrease
in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due to $0.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other acquisition costs related to AMO,
$0.3 billion of higher litigation, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business, $0.1 billion of higher
restructuring and investments in new product launches as compared to the fiscal year 2016. This was partially offset by $0.8 billion higher gains in 2017
related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of Codman Neurosurgery.
In 2016, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 22.2% versus 27.2% in 2015. The decrease in the income before tax
as a percent to sales was primarily due to lower gains of $1.4 billion related to divestitures, higher litigation expense of $0.8 billion and a higher
restructuring charge of $0.1 billion as compared to 2015. This was partially offset by an intangible asset write-down of $0.3 billion related to Acclarent in
2015 and favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2016.
                
 24
                                
Restructuring: In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment. The restructuring actions are
expected to result in annualized pre-tax cost savings of $800 million to $1.0 billion, the majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2018.
Approximately $500 million in savings were realized in 2017. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund
investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it
will record pre-tax restructuring related charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion. In 2017, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $760
million, of which $88 million is included in cost of products sold and $363 million is included in other (income) expense. In 2016, the Company recorded a
pre-tax charge of $685 million, of which $45 million is included in cost of products sold and $149 million is included in other (income) expense. In 2015,
the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $590 million, of which $81 million was included in cost of products sold. Restructuring related charges of $2.0
billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the
restructuring.
Provision for Taxes on Income:  The worldwide effective income tax rate was 92.6% in 2017, 16.5% in 2016 and 19.7% in 2015. The 2017 effective tax
rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the United States in December
2017. The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0 billion or approximately 73.3
percentage point increase to the effective tax rate. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the TCJA.
The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of
changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate, enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Company’s Animas insulin
pump business.
The government in Switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation, which could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate
if enacted into law.
The decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate, as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to the Company adopting a new accounting standard for the
reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested or were exercised during the fiscal year. The remainder of the change in the
effective tax rate was primarily related to the lower earnings before taxes in the United States and the settlement of several uncertain tax positions in 2016
versus 2015.
The decrease in the 2015 effective tax rate, as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions
relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity & Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents were $17.8 billion at the end of 2017 as compared to $19.0 billion at the end of 2016. The primary sources and uses of cash that
contributed to the $1.2 billion decrease were approximately $21.1 billion of cash generated from operating activities and $0.3 billion due to the effect on
exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents offset by $14.9 billion net cash used by investing activities and $7.7 billion net cash used by financing
activities. In addition, the Company had $0.5 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2017 and $22.9 billion at the end of 2016. See Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Cash flow from operations of $21.1 billion was the result of $1.3 billion of net earnings and $9.8 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments
for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, assets write-downs and deferred tax provision, reduced by $1.3 billion from net gains on sale
of assets/businesses and $1.0 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable and an increase in other current and non-current assets. Additional sources
of operating cash flow of $12.3 billion resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a decrease in inventories and an increase in
other current and non-current liabilities. The increase in accrued liabilities and non-current liabilities is primarily due to the 2017 U.S. tax legislation
(TCJA). The U.S. tax of $10.1 billion is payable over 8 years. Additionally, foreign taxes of $3.4 billion, net were recorded in the deferred tax provision.
Investing activities use of $14.9 billion was for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $35.2 billion (primarily the acquisitions of Actelion and AMO for
approximately $29.6 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively) and additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.3 billion. This was partially offset by
proceeds from the net sale of investments primarily marketable securities of $22.0 billion and $1.8 billion of proceeds from the disposal of
assets/businesses (primarily the divestitures of Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED®).
Financing activities use of $7.7 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $8.9 billion, $6.4 billion for the repurchase of common stock and
$0.2 billion of other financing. Financing activities also included sources of $6.8 billion from net proceeds of short and long-term debt and $1.1 billion of
proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net.
On October 13, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase
up to $10.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. As of July 2, 2017, $10.0 billion was repurchased under the program and the program was
completed. Shares acquired are available for general corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. In 2017,
the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to
its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources,
borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to
fund operating needs for the next twelve months. The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise
capital when market conditions are favorable. The Company filed a new shelf registration on February 27, 2017 which will enable it to issue debt securities
on a timely basis. In the fiscal first and fourth quarters of 2017, the Company issued bonds for a total of $9.0 billion for general corporate purposes,
including the completion of the stock repurchase program. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Financing and Market Risk
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into
forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions
primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of
the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2017 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $167 million.
Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2017 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s
forward contracts by $197 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying
transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.
The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by
entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial
instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $69 million. In either scenario, at
maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on
future anticipated cash flows.
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into
contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is
no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote.
The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of
fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if
interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the
unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $8 million.
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2017, the Company secured a new 364-day
Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 13, 2018. Interest charged on borrowings
under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable
margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.
Total borrowings at the end of 2017 and 2016 were $34.6 billion and $27.1 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings between 2017 and 2016
was a result of financing for the Company's share repurchase program and general corporate purposes. In 2017, net debt (cash and current marketable
securities, net of debt) was $16.3 billion compared to net cash of $14.8 billion in 2016. Total debt represented 36.5% of total capital (shareholders’ equity
and total debt) in 2017 and 27.8% of total capital in 2016. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2017 was $22.43 compared to $26.02 at year-end
2016, a decrease of 13.8%.
A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Dividends
The Company increased its dividend in 2017 for the 55th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.32 per share in 2017 compared with dividends of
$3.15 per share in 2016, and $2.95 per share in 2015. The dividends were distributed as follows:
 2017  2016  2015
First quarter $ 0.80 0.75 0.70
Second quarter 0.84 0.80 0.75
Third quarter 0.84 0.80 0.75
Fourth quarter 0.84 0.80 0.75
Total $ 3.32 3.15 2.95
On January 2, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.84 per share, payable on March 13, 2018, to shareholders of
record as of February 27, 2018. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends.

Other Information
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires
that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures.
Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates
are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue
recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for
pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.
Revenue Recognition:  The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered, and title and risk of loss pass to the
customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as
reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Accounting Standards
Update related to revenue which will be adopted in 2018.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include the Medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical
experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for
products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as
internally generated information.
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to
dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product
recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in
accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales
returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices
segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns
reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing
promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical
redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are
recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products. For all years presented, service revenues were
approximately 1% or less of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate
amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.
In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative
partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part
of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
disclosures on collaborations.
Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect
on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a
material financial statement impact.

Income Taxes:  Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between
U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the United States enacted the TCJA, which includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in
foreign jurisdictions. The Company has provisionally booked a $10.1 billion charge on these undistributed earnings in 2017. Additionally, the Company
has provisionally recorded a $4.5 billion deferred tax liability for foreign local and withholding taxes, offset by a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset for U.S.
foreign tax credits, for repatriation of substantially all undistributed foreign earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the remaining undistributed
foreign earnings for which it has not provided deferred taxes for foreign local and withholding tax, as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely
reinvested. The amount of these unrecorded deferred taxes is not expected to be material.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies:  The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability
claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where
applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals
in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable
and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the
minimum amount is accrued.
See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.
                
 30
                                
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets:  The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash
flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may
change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.
Employee Benefit Plans:  The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination
indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,
mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Company’s results of operations.
Stock Based Compensation:  The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their
services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a
combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the
service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield.
For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant.  The fair values for the sales and
earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the
award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period.  The fair value for the relative total
shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements
not yet adopted as of December 31, 2017.
Economic and Market Factors
The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have
expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products
responsibly. For the period 2007 - 2017, in the United States, the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for
health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to
monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way
companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate
surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity
improvements and periodic price increases.
In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to
as “Brexit” and in March 2017 the U.K. formally started the process for the U.K. to leave the E.U.  Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear
what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic
uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors
and changes in regulations.  However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of December 31, 2017, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less
than 3% of both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues, respectively.
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies
in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2017 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately
$360 million and income by $105 million.
Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory
tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that
particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted.  This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the
statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change
is enacted.
                
 31
                                
The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment
and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing
prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global
economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.
The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug
Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents,
seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering
those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar
versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those
products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could
launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further
information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Legal Proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial
and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue
and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20-25. For these and
other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the
possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of
judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be
affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has
not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are
numerous parties involved.
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal
proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.
However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.
See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated.
Description of the Company and Business Segments
The Company has approximately 134,000 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of
products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to
human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad
range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are
marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six
therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices
segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields, which are distributed to
wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
Accounting Standard adopted in 2016
During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Compensation - Stock Compensation:
Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested or were
exercised during the fiscal year. The update requires all excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized as a reduction or an increase to the provision
for taxes on income. Previously, the Company recorded these benefits directly to Retained Earnings. The tax benefit for the Company was $353 million for
the fiscal year 2016. The standard does not permit retroactive presentation of this benefit to prior fiscal years on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
New Accounting Standards
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
ASU 2016-07: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting
The amendments in the update eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for the use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the
level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step
by step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments in this update are
effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be
applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the application of the
equity method. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the presentation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2015-11: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
This update requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary
course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This update is effective for the Company for all annual and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively. This update did not have any material
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Not Adopted as of December 31, 2017
ASU 2018-02: Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
This update allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax
Cuts and Job Act enacted in December 2017. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.
                
 41
                                
ASU 2017-12: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities
This update makes more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting. It also amends the presentation and disclosure
requirements and changes how companies assess effectiveness. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted upon its issuance. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the
future adoption of this standard on its financial statements.
ASU 2017-07: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost
This update requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit cost (“NPBC”). In
addition, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization. This update is effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period for which financial statements (interim or annual)
have not been issued or made available for issuance. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service
cost component and the other components of NPBC in the income statement and prospectively, on and after the effective date, for the capitalization of the
service cost component of NPBC in assets. The Company is assessing the retroactive restatement methodology and impact to the individual line items on
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company does not expect there to be a material impact to net earnings.
ASU 2017-01: Clarifying the Definition of a Business
This update narrows the definition of a business by providing a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The
screen specifies that an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of
is concentrated in a single or a group of similar identifiable assets. This update will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. This update should be applied prospectively. The
Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2016-16: Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory
This update removes the current exception in US GAAP prohibiting entities from recognizing current and deferred income tax expenses or benefits related
to transfer of assets, other than inventory, within the consolidated entity. The current exception to defer the recognition of any tax impact on the transfer of
inventory within the consolidated entity until it is sold to a third party remains unaffected. The amendments in this update are effective for public entities
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The results from a preliminary assessment indicate that the adoption of the standard will
not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial results. The Company expects to record net adjustments to deferred taxes of approximately $2.0
billion, a decrease to Other Assets of approximately $0.7 billion and an increase to retained earnings of approximately $1.3 billion.
ASU 2016-02: Leases
This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all lease obligations and disclosing key information about
leasing arrangements. This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under
current generally accepted accounting principles. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company anticipates that most of its operating
leases will result in the recognition of additional assets and the corresponding liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, however does not expect the
standard to have a material impact on the financial position. The actual impact will depend on the Company's lease portfolio at the time of adoption. The
Company continues to assess all implications of the standard and related financial disclosures.
ASU 2016-01: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
The amendments in this update supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (that is,
trading or available-for-sale) and require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. The
standard amends financial reporting by providing relevant information about an entity’s equity investments and reducing the number of items that are
recognized in other comprehensive income. This update will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and
interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements.
ASU 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The amendments replace substantially all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate industry-specific guidance. Early adoption of this
standard is permitted but not before the original effective date for all annual periods and interim reporting
                
 42
                                
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this standard
will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements including the additional disclosure requirements.
Cash Equivalents
The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly
liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy
of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in
government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs).
RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their value. The
Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that
the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that
collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date
of purchase are classified as marketable securities.
Investments
Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments
classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long
term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such
determination at each balance sheet date. The Company periodically reviews its investments in equity securities for impairment and adjusts these
investments to their fair value when a decline in market value is deemed to be other than temporary. If losses on these securities are considered to be other
than temporary, the loss is recognized in earnings.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:
Building and building equipment 20 - 30 years
Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years
Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with
developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which
generally range from 3 to 8 years.
The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or
economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is
determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not
available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for
certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same
period the related sales are recorded.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include Medicaid, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient
outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups
of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated
information.
Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return
patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales returns accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product
recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for
                
 43
                                
returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of
return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not
resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently
exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual sales to
customers during the fiscal reporting years 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing
promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical
redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are
recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products and includes it in sales to customers. These
arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.
Shipping and Handling
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $1,042 million, $974 million and $996 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in selling,
marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods
presented.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The
Company completed the annual impairment test for 2017 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth
quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying
project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the
intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by
economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill.
Financial Instruments
As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1
having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for
undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the
Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness
of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial
Instruments.
Product Liability
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted
periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when
those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated.
As a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. The
Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed
the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and
development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval.
                
 44
                                
Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product.
Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize
drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are
exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by
one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and
royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due
from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the
performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these
collaborations is as follows:
Nature/Type of Collaboration  Statement of Earnings Presentation
Third-party sale of product  Sales to customers
Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory
approval)*  Cost of products sold
Royalties received from collaborative partner  Other income (expense), net
Upfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-
regulatory approval)  Research and development expense
Research and development payments to collaborative partner  Research and development expense
Research and development payments received from collaborative partner Reduction of Research and development expense
* Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life.
For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense.
The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO®, co-developed with
Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA®, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.
 
Advertising
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising
expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $2.5 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion in 2017, 2016
and 2015, respectively.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP
accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax
regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the United States enacted the TCJA, which includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in
foreign jurisdictions. The Company has provisionally booked a $10.1 billion charge on these undistributed earnings in 2017. Additionally, the Company
has provisionally recorded a $4.5 billion deferred tax liability for foreign local and withholding taxes, offset by a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset for U.S.
foreign tax credits, for repatriation of substantially all undistributed foreign earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the remaining undistributed
foreign earnings for which it has not provided deferred taxes for foreign local and withholding tax, as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely
reinvested. The amount of these unrecorded deferred taxes is not expected to be material.
See Note 8 for further information regarding income taxes.
                
 45
                                
Net Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common
stock using the treasury stock method.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives,
product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability
valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and
can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the
minimum amount is accrued.
Annual Closing Date
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year
consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in
2015, and will be the case again in 2020.
Reclassification
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

The Company capitalizes interest expense as part of the cost of construction of facilities and equipment. Interest expense capitalized in 2017, 2016 and
2015 was $94 million, $102 million and $102 million, respectively.
Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $2.6 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.5 billion,
respectively.
Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are
eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds are
recorded in earnings.
5.Intangible Assets and Goodwill
At the end of 2017 and 2016, the gross and net amounts of intangible assets were:
(Dollars in Millions)  2017  2016
Intangible assets with definite lives:     
Patents and trademarks — gross  $ 36,427 10,521

Currency translation/other  584 109 122 815
Goodwill at December 31, 2017  $ 8,875 9,109 13,922 31,906
The weighted average amortization periods for patents and trademarks and customer relationships and other intangible assets are 12 years and 23 years,
respectively. The amortization expense of amortizable assets included in cost of products sold was $3.0 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion before tax, for
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding
years approximates $4.4 billion before tax, per year. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net.
The primary driver of the increase to intangible assets and goodwill is related to the Actelion acquisition in the fiscal second quarter of 2017, which
resulted in the recording of $25.0 billion to intangible assets and $6.2 billion to goodwill. The intangible assets and goodwill amounts related to the
Actelion acquisition are based on the preliminary purchase price allocation. Additionally, the Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) acquisition in the fiscal first
quarter of 2017, resulted in the recording of $2.3 billion to intangible assets and $1.7 billion to goodwill. The intangible assets and goodwill amounts
related to the AMO acquisition are based on the final purchase price allocation.
See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures.
6.Fair Value Measurements
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange
rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency
interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. The Company also uses equity collar contracts to manage exposure to market
risk associated with certain equity investments. All three types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.
Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are
designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company
uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts
are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings
effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent
features. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties
establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of December 31, 2017, the total amount of collateral paid
under the credit support agreements (CSA) amounted to $162 million net. For equity collar contracts, the Company pledged the underlying hedged
marketable equity securities to the counter-party as collateral. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company
considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an
investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for
receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign
exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $34.5 billion, $2.3 billion, and $1.1 billion respectively. As of January 1,
2017, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps and
equity collar contracts of $36.0 billion, $2.3 billion, $1.8 billion, and $0.3 billion respectively.
                
 49
                                
All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current
earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge
transaction.
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly
effective. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge and is highly effective are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.
Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest
expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account. On an
ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a
derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period
earnings in Other (income) expense, net for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, net investment hedges and equity collar
contracts. For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings within interest
expense. For the current reporting period, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate swaps was not material.
During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022
to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in
order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.
The change in the carrying value due to remeasurement of these Euro notes resulted in a $597 million unrealized pretax loss for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2017, reflected in foreign currency translation adjustment, within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The change in the
carrying value due to remeasurement of these Euro notes resulted in a cumulative $222 million unrealized pretax loss from hedge inception through the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, reflected in foreign currency translation adjustment, within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the balance of deferred net gains on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $70
million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that
substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of
transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18
months, excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as
foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.
The following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017
and January 1, 2017:

For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, a loss of $5 million and $56 million, respectively, was recognized in Other (income)
expense, net, relating to forward foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments.
Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the
inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the
lowest.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all
future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot
foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be
realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or
financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The
Company did not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities which would require revised valuations under this standard that are recognized at
fair value.
The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.
Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.
The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 were as follows:

8.Income Taxes
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118)
On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, referred to as the TCJA. This law includes provisions for a
comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January
1, 2018. This new legislation also eliminated or reduced certain corporate income tax deductions as well as introduced new provisions that taxed certain
foreign income not previously taxed by the United States. The TCJA also includes a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S.
companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents is taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings
are taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest.
In December 2017, the SEC provided regulatory guidance for accounting of the impacts of the TCJA, referred to as SAB 118. Under the guidance in
SAB 118, the income tax effects, which the accounting under ASC 740 is incomplete, are reported as a provisional amount based on a reasonable estimate.
The reasonable estimate is subject to adjustment during a "measurement period", not to exceed one year, until the accounting is complete. The estimate is
also subject to the finalization of management’s analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provision of the TCJA, changes
to certain estimates and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain subsidiaries and the filing of tax returns.
As a result of the enactment of the TCJA, the Company recorded a provisional tax cost of $13.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. This provisional
charge was assessed as of January 18, 2018 and consisted of:
•a $10.1 billion charge on previously undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017
•a $4.5 billion deferred tax liability for foreign local and withholding taxes, offset by a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset for U.S. foreign tax credits,
for repatriation of substantially all those earnings
                
 54
                                
•a $0.6 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and the impact of the TCJA on tax reserves, and
•a $0.1 billion charge for U.S. state and local taxes on the repatriation of these foreign earnings.
In determining this charge, the Company utilized the most recent information and guidance available related to the calculation of the tax liability and the
impact to its deferred tax assets and liabilities, including those recorded for foreign local and withholding taxes that the Company assessed as of January
18, 2018. The provisional charge may require further adjustments and changes to the Company’s estimates as new guidance is made available. Revisions to
the provisional charge may be material to the Company's financial results.
The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total
net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, in response to inquiries by companies, the FASB
issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to treat the GILTI tax as a period cost or to recognize deferred tax assets
and liabilities when basis differences exist that are expected to affect the amount of GILTI inclusion upon reversal. The Company has provisionally elected
to treat GILTI as a period expense pending further analysis of this new tax provision.
The provision for taxes on income consists of:

A comparison of income tax expense at the U.S. statutory rate of 35% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, to the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:

(1) For all periods presented the Company has subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under various tax incentives. In 2017, International operations reflects the impacts of operations in
jurisdictions with statutory tax rates different than the United States, particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a
                
 55
                                
favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the 35.0% U.S. statutory rate. The 2017 amount also includes tax cost related to the revaluation of deferred tax balances related to the
change in the Belgian statutory tax rate increasing the tax provision by approximately 3.4%.
(2) Includes U.S. state and local taxes provisionally recorded as part TCJA provisional charge which was approximately 0.6% of the total effective tax rate
The 2017 effective tax rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the TCJA in the United States in December
2017. The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0 billion or approximately 73.3
percentage point increase to the effective tax rate.
The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of
changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Company’s Animas insulin
pump business.
The decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate, as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to the Company adopting a new accounting standard for the
reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested or were exercised during the fiscal year. The remainder of the change in the
effective tax rate was primarily related to the lower earnings before taxes in the United States and the settlement of several uncertain tax positions in 2016
versus 2015.
The decrease in the 2015 effective tax rate, as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions
relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates.
The items noted above reflect the key drivers of the rate reconciliation.

The Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that these
subsidiaries will realize future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets.
The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits:

(1) $347 million of this decrease is related to the TCJA
The unrecognized tax benefits of $3.2 billion at December 31, 2017, if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The Company
conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. The IRS has
completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012. In other major jurisdictions where the Company
conducts business, the years remain open generally back to the year 2004. The Company believes it is possible that audits may be completed by tax
authorities in some
                
 56
                                
jurisdictions over the next twelve months.  However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax
payments relating to uncertain tax positions.
The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities. Interest expense and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $60 million, $7 million and
$44 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $436 million and $344 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
9.Employee Related Obligations
At the end of 2017 and 2016, employee related obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were:

Prepaid employee related obligations of $526 million and $227 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
10.Pensions and Other Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover
most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their
dependents.
Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant.
Retirement plan benefits for employees are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last three to five years before retirement and
the number of years of service. Due to an amendment of the formula used to calculate benefits of the U.S. Defined Benefit Plan that occurred in 2014,
benefits for employees hired on or after January 1, 2015, are primarily calculated using employee compensation over total years of service.
International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are
provided.
The Company does not typically fund retiree health care benefits in advance, but may do so at its discretion. The Company also has the right to modify
these plans in the future.
In 2017 and 2016 the Company used December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international
retirement and other benefit plans.
Net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2017, 2016 and 2015 include the following
components:
  Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans

Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active
employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using
a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in
excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.
Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the
plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan
participants at the time of the plan amendment.
The following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions:
  Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans

Rate of increase in compensation levels  3.99% 4.02 4.01 4.30 4.29 4.28
The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The
resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. For the fiscal year 2016, the Company changed its methodology in determining
service and interest cost from the single weighted average discount rate approach to duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability
cash flows, which management has concluded is a more precise estimate. Prior to this change in methodology, the Company measured service and interest
costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The Company has accounted for
this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change does not impact the benefit
obligation and did not have a material impact to the 2016 full year results.
The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios
globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the
various asset class allocations by market.

The Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. International Plans are funded in
accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans.
For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that
are not funded.
In 2017, the Company contributed $72 million and $592 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively.
The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded
pension plans at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively:

Each pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall administration and investment of the pension plans. In
determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax
regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives
to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority
of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed,
with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds.
The Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2017 and 2016 and target allocations for 2018 are as follows:
  Percent of
Plan Assets  Target
Allocation
  2017  2016  2018
Worldwide Retirement Plans       
Equity securities  76% 75% 73%
Debt securities  24 25 27
Total plan assets  100% 100% 100%
Determination of Fair Value of Plan Assets
The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If
listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market
parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.
While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or
assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
Valuation Hierarchy
The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are
described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.
•Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the
custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the
fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares
outstanding. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2.
•Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on
which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of
the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models,
quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an
active market, they are classified as Level 2.
•Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual
securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are
not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar
characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs.
•Equity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.
Substantially all common stock is classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
•Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of
the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Assets in the Level 2 category
have a quoted market price.
                
 62
                                
•Insurance contracts — The instruments are issued by insurance companies. The fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying
investments held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer. The underlying investments are
government, asset-backed and fixed income securities. In general, insurance contracts are classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices nor
other observable inputs for pricing.
•Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships and real estate investments, as well as commercial loans and
commercial mortgages that are not classified as corporate debt. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1,
while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2.

14.International Currency Translation
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international
subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative
rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority
of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical
rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in
the operating results.
A rollforward of the changes during 2017, 2016 and 2015 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13.
Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $216 million, $289 million and $104 million in 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively.
15.Earnings Per Share
The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, January 1,
2017 and January 3, 2016:
(In Millions Except Per Share Amounts)  2017  2016  2015
Basic net earnings per share  $ 0.48 6.04 5.56
Average shares outstanding — basic  2,692.0 2,737.3 2,771.8
Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans  139.7 142.4 141.5
Less: shares repurchased under treasury stock method  (87.3) (92.1) (102.6)
Convertible debt shares  0.9 1.3 2.2
Adjusted average shares outstanding — diluted  2,745.3 2,788.9 2,812.9
Diluted net earnings per share  $ 0.47 5.93 5.48
The diluted net earnings per share calculation included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that is offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $1
million after-tax for year 2017, $2 million for year 2016 and $3 million for year 2015.
The diluted net earnings per share calculation for 2017, 2016 and 2015 included all shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of all options
was less than the average market value of the Company's stock.
 
16.Rental Expense and Lease Commitments
Rentals of space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and office and data processing equipment under operating leases were approximately $372 million,
$330 million and $316 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The approximate minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one
year at December 31, 2017 are:

Commitments under capital leases are not significant.
17.Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements
At December 31, 2017, the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-
Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares
granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to
650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to
April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 389 million at the end of 2017.
The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $962 million, $878 million and $874 million for 2017, 2016 and
2015, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $275 million, $256 million and
$253 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. An additional tax
                
 65
                                
benefit of $353 million was recognized in 2016 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based
compensation. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $798 million, $749 million and $744 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.76 years, 1.09 years and 0.98 years for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Share-based
compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.
The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished throughout the year for the number of
shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.
Stock Options
Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years. All options are granted at the
average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted
in the following table. For 2017, 2016 and 2015 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and
a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is
used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The average fair value of options granted was $13.38, $10.01 and $10.68, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the
weighted average assumptions of:
 2017  2016  2015
Risk-free rate 2.25% 1.51% 1.77%
Expected volatility 15.30% 15.76% 15.48%
Expected life (in years) 7.0 7.0 7.0
Expected dividend yield 2.90% 3.10% 2.90%

share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three-year performance period. Whether any performance
share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a
three-year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted
operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-year period will vary,
based only on actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company
modified the restricted share units that are scheduled to vest between January 1, 2018 and March 15, 2018. This modification guaranteed a minimum
aggregate value, below the market value of the total expected payout amount, for all awards expected to vest during this period. The amount that was
committed was not material to the Company’s overall financial position.
A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of December 31, 2017 is presented below:
(Shares in Thousands)  Outstanding
Restricted Share

Canceled/forfeited/adjusted  (943) 295
Shares at December 31, 2017  20,161 2,625
The average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $107.69, $92.45 and $91.65 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, using the fair market
value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the
vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $596.5 million, $587.7 million and $597.6 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $114.13, $105.30 and $93.54 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, calculated using the
weighted average fair market value for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. 
The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value
of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period.  The fair value
for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The
fair value of performance share units issued was $132.5 million, $127.7 million and $16.7 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

20.Business Combinations and Divestitures
Certain businesses were acquired for $35,151 million in cash and $1,786 million of liabilities assumed during 2017. These acquisitions were accounted for
using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of
acquisition.
The 2017 acquisitions primarily included: Actelion Ltd an established leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH); Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, which included ophthalmic products related to:
cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health; Neuravi Limited, a privately-held medical device company that develops and markets
medical devices for neurointerventional therapy; TearScience Inc., a manufacturer of products dedicated to treating meibomian gland dysfunction;
Sightbox, Inc., a privately-held company that developed a subscription vision care service that connects consumers with eye care professionals and a supply
of contact lenses; Torax Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that manufactures and markets the LINX™ Reflux Management System
for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that develops,
manufactures and markets electrosurgical tools.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $34,379 million and has been assigned to
identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $1,139 million has been identified as the value of
IPR&D primarily associated with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the
inherent risk in the projects.
During 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Actelion Ltd through an all cash tender offer in Switzerland for $280 per share, amounting to
$29.6 billion, net of cash acquired. As part of the transaction, immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition, Actelion spun out its drug discovery
operations and early-stage clinical development assets into a newly created Swiss biopharmaceutical company, Idorsia Ltd. The shares of Idorsia are listed
on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX). The Company currently holds 9.9% of the shares of Idorsia and has rights to an additional 22.1% of Idorsia equity
through a convertible loan with a principal amount of approximately $0.5 billion. The convertible loan may be converted into Idorsia shares as follows: (i)
up to an aggregate shareholding of 16% of Idorsia shares as a result of certain shareholders holding more than 20% of the issued Idorsia shares, and (ii) up
to the balance of the remaining amount within 20 business days of the maturity date of the convertible loan, which has a 10 year term, or if Idorsia
undergoes a change of control transaction. The investment in Idorsia was recorded as a cost method investment in Other assets in the Company's
consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company also exercised the option acquired on ACT-132577, a product within Idorsia being developed for resistant
hypertension currently in phase 2 of clinical development. The Company has also entered into an agreement to provide Idorsia with a Swiss franc
denominated credit facility of approximately $250 million. As of December 31, 2017, Idorsia has not made any draw-downs under the credit facility.
Actelion has entered into a transitional services agreement with Idorsia. Actelion has established a leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products
for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that are highly complementary to the existing portfolio of the Company. The addition of Actelion’s specialty in-
market medicines and late-stage products is consistent with the Company's efforts to grow in attractive and complementary therapeutic areas and serve
patients with serious illnesses and significant unmet medical need.
The Company is still finalizing the allocation of the purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the
purchase price included in the current period balance sheet is based on the best estimate of management and is preliminary and subject to change. To assist
management in the allocation, the Company engaged valuation specialists to prepare appraisals. The Company will finalize the amounts recognized as the
information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. The Company expects to finalize these amounts as soon as possible but no later than one year
from the acquisition date.
                
 71
                                
The following table presents the preliminary amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed for Actelion as of the acquisition date as well
as the adjustments made up to December 31, 2017:
(Dollars in Millions) June 16, 2017 December 31, 2017
Cash & Cash equivalents $ 469 469

Total Assets Acquired 32,928 33,199 
Current liabilities 531 956 
Deferred Taxes 1,960 1,776 
Other non-current liabilities 383 413 
Total Liabilities Assumed 2,874 3,145 
Net Assets Acquired $ 30,054 30,054 
(1) Includes adjustment of $642 million to write-up the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value.
Subsequent to the date of acquisition there was an adjustment of $0.2 billion to the deferred taxes and $0.4 billion to the current liabilities with the
offset to goodwill.
The assets acquired are recorded in the Pharmaceutical segment. The acquisition of Actelion resulted in approximately $6.2 billion of goodwill. The
goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The purchase price allocation to the identifiable intangible assets is as follows:
(Dollars in Millions)
Intangible assets with definite lives:
Patents and trademarks $ 24,230 
Total amortizable intangibles 24,230 
In-process research and development 780 
Total intangible assets $ 25,010 
The patents and trademarks acquired are comprised of developed technology with a weighted average life of 9 years and was primarily based on the
patent life of the marketed products. The intangible assets with definite lives were assigned asset lives ranging from 4 to 10 years. The in-process research
and development intangible assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products.
The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount
rate applied was 9%.
The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of operations of Actelion were reported in the Company's
financial statements beginning on June 16, 2017, the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2017 total sales and a net loss for Actelion from
the date of acquisition were $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.
The following table provides pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, as if Actelion had been
acquired as of January 4, 2016. The pro forma results include the effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimated changes in
depreciation and amortization expense on the acquired tangible and intangible assets. However, pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost
savings or other effects of the planned
                
 72
                                
integration of Actelion. Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results if the acquisition had occurred on the dates indicated or
which may occur in the future.
Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated
Results
(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Data) 2017 2016
Net Sales 77,681 74,339

Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share 0.55 4.99 
In 2017, the Company recorded Actelion acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $0.8 billion, which was recorded in Other
(income)/expense and Cost of products sold.
During 2017, the Company acquired Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, for $4.3 billion, net of cash
acquired. The acquisition included ophthalmic products related to: cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health. The net purchase
price was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $2.3 billion and goodwill for $1.7 billion. The weighted average life of total amortizable
intangibles, the majority being customer relationships, is approximately 14.4 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise
from the business acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets and goodwill amounts are based on the final purchase price
allocation. The assets acquired were recorded in the Medical Devices segment.
Certain businesses were acquired for $4,509 million in cash and $77 million of liabilities assumed during 2016. These acquisitions were accounted for
using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of
acquisition.
The 2016 acquisitions primarily included: Vogue International LLC, a privately-held company focused on the marketing, development and distribution
of salon-influenced and nature inspired hair care and other personal products; NeuWave Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that
manufactures and markets minimally invasive soft tissue microwave ablation systems; NeoStrata Company, Inc., a global leader in dermocosmetics, and
the global rights for the commercialization of RHINOCORT® allergy spray outside the United States.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $4,077 million and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.
The net purchase price for Vogue International LLC of $3.3 billion was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $2.3 billion and
goodwill for $1.1 billion. The weighted average life for the $2.3 billion of total amortizable intangibles is approximately 22 years. The trademark asset
values were determined to have definite lives ranging from 10 to 22 years, with the majority being 22 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to
synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The assets acquired were recorded in the
Consumer segment.
Certain businesses were acquired for $954 million in cash and $220 million of liabilities assumed during 2015. The assumed liabilities primarily
represent the fair value of the contingent consideration of $210 million. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and,
accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
The 2015 acquisitions primarily included: XO1 Limited, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company developing an anti-thrombin antibody and
Novira Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies for curative treatment of chronic
hepatitis B virus infection.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $1,173 million and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $839 million has been identified as the value of IPR&D primarily
associated with the acquisitions of XO1 Limited and Novira Therapeutics, Inc. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections
discounted for the inherent risk in the projects.
The IPR&D related to the acquisition of XO1 Limited of $360 million is associated with a recombinant human antibody developed to mimic the
activity of a human antibody which appears to produce an anticoagulated state without predisposition to bleeding. A probability of success factor of 36.0%
was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 11.75%.
The IPR&D related to the acquisition of Novira Therapeutics, Inc. of $396 million is associated with its lead candidate NVR 3-778 which is an
investigational small molecule, direct-acting antiviral, for oral administration in patients with HBV that inhibits the HBV core or capsid protein. A
probability of success factor of 51.0% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 16.0%. During 2017, the
Company recorded a charge for the impairment of the IPR&D related to the acquisition of Novira Therapeutics, Inc. The impairment was the result of the
cancellation of product development due to safety concerns.

In 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. for a purchase price of $20.2 billion in cash and stock. In connection with the
acquisition of Synthes, Inc. the Company entered into two accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements.  In 2013, the Company settled the remaining
liabilities under the ASR agreements. While the Company believes that the transactions under each ASR agreement and a series of related internal
transactions were consummated in a tax efficient manner in accordance with applicable law, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could assert one
or more contrary positions to challenge the transactions from a tax perspective. If challenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the Synthes
shares could be treated as subject to applicable U.S. tax at approximately the statutory rate to the Company, plus interest.
With the exception of the Actelion Ltd acquisition, supplemental pro forma information for 2017, 2016 and 2015 in accordance with U.S. GAAP
standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did
not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
During the fiscal first quarter of 2017, the Company announced it is engaging in a process to evaluate potential strategic options for the Johnson &
Johnson Diabetes Care Companies, specifically LifeScan, Inc., Animas Corporation, and Calibra Medical, Inc. Strategic options may include the formation
of operating partnerships, joint ventures or strategic alliances, a sale of the businesses, or other alternatives either separately or together. During the fiscal
second quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.2 billion, primarily related to the insulin pump business. During the fiscal
fourth quarter of 2017, the Company announced its decision to exit the Animas insulin pump business. The Company is continuing to evaluate potential
strategic options for LifeScan, Inc. and determine the best opportunity to drive future growth and maximize shareholder value. There were no assets held

21.Legal Proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial
and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount
of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters
are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust
accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and
regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss
beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including
whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete;
proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved.
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal
proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.
However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.
PRODUCT LIABILITY
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in
these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible
to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company has
                
 74
                                
established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some
cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be
reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements,
damages and other losses. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is
determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims
around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as
additional information becomes available.
The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE®
Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL®; XARELTO® ; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS® Baby Powder; and
INVOKANA®. As of December 31, 2017, in the U.S. there were approximately 2,000 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries
allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System, 10,000 with respect to the PINNACLE®
Acetabular Cup System, 53,600 with respect to pelvic meshes, 13,700 with respect to RISPERDAL®, 22,900 with respect to XARELTO®, 6,610 with
respect to body powders containing talc; and 1,100 with respect to INVOKANA®.
In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip
Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of
pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the
United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been
filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy
reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with
eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy
reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had
revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, with more
expected from the recent extension, therefore bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the
United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was
reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. The Company continues to receive information with respect to
potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United
States settlement program and DePuy ASR™ Hip-related product liability litigation.
Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson relating to the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup
System used in hip replacement surgery. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive
information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a
multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in some state courts and in
countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, a trial is ongoing regarding common issues of liability and
a decision is expected in the first half of 2018. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs in connection with product liability litigation
associated with the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System.
Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to
treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional
cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of West Virginia. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and the costs associated with these
settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in
various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium, and class actions in Israel,
Australia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices. In Australia, a trial of class action issues is ongoing
and a decision is expected in 2018. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh
products.
Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL®, indicated
for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism, and related
compounds. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the
United States and Canada. Product
                
 75
                                
liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases.
The Company has established an accrual with respect to product liability litigation associated with RISPERDAL®.
Claims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO®, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI);
Johnson & Johnson; and JPI's collaboration partner for XARELTO® Bayer AG and certain of its affiliates. The number of pending product liability lawsuits
continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in
federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
In addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases have been consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and there are coordinated proceedings in Delaware, California and Missouri. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in
Canada. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs in connection with product liability litigation associated with XARELTO®.
Claims for personal injury have been made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders
containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS® Baby Powder. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues
to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Missouri,
New Jersey and California. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs in connection with product liability litigation associated
with body powders containing talc. 
Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson &
Johnson, arising out of the use of INVOKANA®, a prescription medication indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. The
number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and
the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California and New Jersey. Class action lawsuits
have been filed in Canada. The Company has established an accrual with respect to product liability litigation associated with INVOKANA®.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual
property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products
and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial
defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in
any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity,
require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. The most
significant of these matters are described below.
Medical Devices
In June 2009, Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. (Rembrandt) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI)
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that JJVCI's manufacture and sale of its ACUVUE® ADVANCE and ACUVUE
OASYS® Hydrogel Contact Lenses infringed Rembrandt’s United States Patent No. 5,712,327 and seeking monetary relief. The case was transferred to the
United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, where a trial in May 2012 resulted in a verdict of non-infringement that was subsequently
upheld on appeal. In July 2014, Rembrandt sought a new trial based on alleged new evidence, which the District Court denied. In April 2016, the Court of
Appeals overturned that ruling and remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial. A new trial was held in August 2017, and the jury returned a
verdict of non-infringement in favor of JJVCI. Rembrandt has appealed the verdict to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson & Johnson in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Cordis’s sales of the CYPHER™ and CYPHER SELECT™ stents made in the
United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents. Medinol is seeking damages and
attorneys’ fees. After trial in January 2014, the District Court dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed bringing its claims (the laches
defense). In September 2014,
                
 76
                                
the District Court denied a motion by Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial. Medinol appealed the decision to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit, then dismissed the appeal in order to file a petition for review with the United States Supreme Court. In March 2017, the
United States Supreme Court held that the laches defense is not available in patent cases and remanded this case to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit to consider Medinol's appeal of whether Medinol is entitled to seek a new trial. Cordis was divested in 2015, and the Company retained
any liability that may result from this case.
In November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE® Knee System. MedIdea alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos.
6,558,426 (’426); 8,273,132; 8,721,730 and 9,492,280 relating to posterior stabilized knee systems. Specifically, MedIdea alleges that the SOFCAMTM
Contact feature of the ATTUNE® posterior stabilized knee products infringes the patents-in-suit. MedIdea is seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief. In June 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. In December 2017, DePuy Synthes
Products, Inc. filed a Petition for Inter Partes Review with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, seeking to invalidate the ’426 patent.
In December 2016, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, LLC (now known as Ethicon LLC) sued Covidien, Inc. in the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that United States Patent Nos. 6,585,735 (the ’735 patent); 7,118,587; 7,473,253;
8,070,748 and 8,241,284 (the ’284 patent), are either invalid or not infringed by Ethicon’s ENSEAL® X1 Large Jaw Tissue Sealer product. In April 2017,
Covidien LP, Covidien Sales LLC, and Covidien AG (collectively, Covidien) answered and counterclaimed, denying the allegations, asserting willful
infringement of the ’735 patent, the ’284 patent and United States Patent Nos. 8,323,310; 9,084,608; 9,241,759 and 9,113,882, and seeking damages and an
injunction. Covidien filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which was denied in October 2017. Trial is scheduled for September, 2019.
In November 2017, Board of Regents, The University of Texas System and Tissuegen, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Texas against Ethicon, Inc. and Ethicon US, LLC alleging the manufacture and sale of VICRYL® Plus Antibacterial Sutures and
MONOCRYL® Plus Antibacterial Sutures infringe plaintiffs’ United States Patent Nos. 6,596,296 and 7,033,603 directed to implantable polymer drug
releasing biodegradable fibers containing a therapeutic agent.
Pharmaceutical
In April 2016, MorphoSys AG, a German biotech company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI), Genmab U.S. Inc. and
Genmab A/S (collectively, Genmab) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. MorphoSys alleges that JBI’s manufacture and sale of
DARZALEX® (daratumumab) willfully infringes MorphoSys’ United States Patent Nos. 8,263,746, 9,200,061 and 9,785,590. MorphoSys is seeking
money damages. JBI licenses patents and the commercial rights to DARZALEX® from Genmab. Trial in the case is scheduled to commence in February
2019.
In August 2016, Sandoz Ltd and Hexal AG (collectively, Sandoz) filed a lawsuit in the English High Court against G.D. Searle LLC (a Pfizer company)
and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (JSI) alleging that Searle’s supplementary protection certificate SPC/GB07/038 (SPC), which is exclusively licensed to
JSI, is invalid and should be revoked. Janssen-Cilag Limited sells PREZISTA® (darunavir) in the United Kingdom pursuant to this license. In October
2016, Searle and JSI counterclaimed against Sandoz for threatened infringement of the SPC based on statements of its plans to launch generic darunavir in
the United Kingdom. Sandoz admitted that its generic darunavir product would infringe the SPC if it is found valid. Searle and JSI are seeking an order
enjoining Sandoz from marketing its generic darunavir before the expiration of the SPC. Following a trial in April 2017, the Court entered a decision
holding that the SPC is valid and granting a final injunction. Sandoz has appealed the Court’s decision and the injunction will be stayed pending the appeal.
In January 2018, the Court referred the issue on appeal to the Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) and stayed the proceedings pending the
CJEU’s ruling on the issue.
REMICADE® Related Cases
United States Proceedings
In September 2013, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYU) received an Office Action from the United States Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) rejecting the claims in United States Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE® (infliximab) (the ’471 patent) in a
reexamination proceeding instituted by a third party. The ’471 patent expires in September 2018 and is co-owned by JBI and NYU, with NYU having
granted JBI an exclusive license to NYU’s rights under the patent. Following several office actions by the patent examiner, including two further rejections,
and responses by
                
 77
                                
JBI, the USPTO issued a further action maintaining its rejection of the ’471 patent. JBI filed a notice of appeal to the USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal
Board (the Board), which issued a decision in November 2016 upholding the examiner's rejection. In January 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's decision.
In August 2014, Celltrion Healthcare Co. Ltd. and Celltrion Inc. (collectively, Celltrion) filed an application with the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for approval to make and sell its own infliximab biosimilar. In March 2015, JBI filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for
the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira), which has exclusive marketing rights for Celltrion's
infliximab biosimilar in the United States, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product infringes or potentially
infringes several JBI patents, including the ’471 patent and United States Patent No. 7,598,083 (the ’083 patent). In August 2016, the District Court granted
both Celltrion's and Hospira's motions for summary judgment of invalidity of the ’471 patent. JBI appealed those decisions to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In January 2018, the Federal Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot based on its affirmance of the Board’s reexamination
decision.
In June 2016, JBI filed two additional patent infringement lawsuits asserting the ’083 patent, one against Celltrion and Hospira in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts and the other against HyClone Laboratories, Inc., the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to
make its biosimilar product, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Although the ’083 patent is already asserted in the existing lawsuit
against Celltrion, the additional lawsuit expands the claims to include the sale in the United States of Celltrion's biosimilar product manufactured with cell
culture media made in the United States. This additional lawsuit against Celltrion has been consolidated with the existing lawsuit discussed above. Hospira
has moved to dismiss all counts of the lawsuit related to the ’083 patent as to it. Celltrion's motion to dismiss all counts of the lawsuit related to the ’083
patent for failure to join all the co-owners of the '083 patent as plaintiffs was denied in October 2017. Trial is scheduled to begin in July 2018. The
litigation against HyClone in Utah is stayed pending the outcome of the Massachusetts actions.
The FDA approved Celltrion’s infliximab biosimilar for sale in the United States in April 2016. Hospira's parent company, Pfizer Inc., launched Celltrion's
infliximab biosimilar in the United States in late 2016.
In April 2017, JBI received notice that the FDA approved a marketing application submitted by Samsung Bioepis Co. Ltd. (Samsung) for the sale of its
infliximab biosimilar in the United States. In May 2017, JBI filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung in the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey alleging that the sale of its biosimilar product may infringe three of JBI’s patents. In July 2017, Samsung launched its biosimilar
product (commercialized by Merck) in the United States. In November 2017, JBI voluntarily dismissed this lawsuit.
Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)
The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA, or
undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson &
Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity
and unenforceability of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in these actions, or the statutory 30-month stays of the
ANDAs expire before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved will have the ability, upon approval of the
FDA, to introduce generic versions of the products at issue to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those
products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle
these actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the
relevant patents. The inter partes review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the 2011 America
Invents Act, is also being used by generic companies in conjunction with these ANDAs and lawsuits to challenge patents held by the Company’s
subsidiaries.
ZYTIGA®
In July 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc. and Janssen Research & Development, LLC (collectively, Janssen) and BTG International Ltd.
(BTG) initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against a number of generic companies (and
certain of their affiliates and/or suppliers) who filed ANDAs seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA® 250mg before the expiration of
United States Patent No. 8,822,438 (the ’438 patent). The generic companies currently include Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Amneal Pharmaceuticals
of New York, LLC (collectively, Amneal); Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex); Citron Pharma LLC (Citron); Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories,
Ltd. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, Dr. Reddy’s); Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc.
                
 78
                                
(collectively, Mylan); Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (collectively, Par); Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Sun
Pharmaceuticals Industries, Inc. (collectively, Sun); Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva); Wockhardt Bio A.G.; Wockhardt USA LLC and Wockhardt
Ltd. (collectively, Wockhardt); West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp. (West-Ward) and Hikma Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Hikma). In February 2018, the court
heard oral arguments on a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement filed by certain defendants.  The parties await a decision. If the decision is
unfavorable, the stay could be lifted and a generic version of ZYTIGA® could enter the market.
Janssen and BTG also initiated patent infringement lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Amerigen
Pharmaceuticals Limited (Amerigen) in May 2016, and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in June 2016, each of whom filed an ANDA seeking approval to
market its generic version of ZYTIGA® before the expiration of the ’438 patent.
 
In August 2015, Janssen and BTG filed an additional jurisdictional protective lawsuit against the Mylan defendants in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of West Virginia, which has been stayed.
In August 2017, Janssen and BTG initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Teva,
who filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA® 500mg before the expiration of the ’438 patent.
In January 2018, Janssen dismissed its lawsuit against Sun after it withdrew its ANDA.
In each of the above lawsuits, Janssen is seeking an order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of ZYTIGA® before the
expiration of the ’438 patent.
Several generic companies including Amerigen, Argentum Pharmaceuticals LLC (Argentum), Mylan, Wockhardt, Actavis, Amneal, Dr. Reddy’s, Sun,
Teva, West-Ward and Hikma filed Petitions for Inter Partes Review (IPR) with the USPTO, seeking to invalidate the ’438 patent. In January 2018, the
USPTO issued decisions invalidating the '438 patent, and Janssen is appealing this decision. The IPR decisions are not binding on the district court in the
pending litigation.
In October 2017, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Oncology, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) initiated two Notices of Application under Section 6 of the Patented
Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations against Teva Canada Limited (Teva) and the Minister of Health in Canada in response to Teva's filing
Abbreviated New Drug Submissions (ANDS) and seeking approval to market generic versions of ZYTIGA® 250mg and ZYTIGA® 500mg before the
expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,661,422.
In November 2017, Janssen initiated a Notice of Application under Section 6 of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations against
Apotex Inc. (Apotex) and the Minister of Health in Canada in response to Apotex’s filing of an Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS) seeking
approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA® before the expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,661,422.
In each of these Notices of Application, Janssen is seeking an order prohibiting the Minister of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance with respect to
Teva's and Apotex's ANDS before the expiration of Janssen's patent.
 
COMPLERA®
In August and September 2015, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (collectively, Janssen) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Gilead
Sciences Ireland UC (collectively, Gilead) initiated patent infringement lawsuits in the United States District Courts for the District of Delaware and the
District of West Virginia, respectively, against Mylan, Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, Mylan), who filed an ANDA seeking approval to
market a generic version of COMPLERA® before the expiration of United States Patent Nos. 8,841,310, 7,125,879 and 8,101,629. In July 2017, the West
Virginia lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice by stipulation of the parties.
In the Delaware lawsuit, Janssen and Gilead amended their complaint to add claims for patent infringement with respect to United States Patent Nos.
8,080,551; 7,399,856; 7,563,922; 8,101,752 and 8,618,291. In November 2017, the parties entered into a settlement agreement.
XARELTO®
Beginning in October 2015, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) and Bayer Pharma AG and Bayer Intellectual Property GmbH (collectively, Bayer) filed
patent infringement lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against a number of generic companies who filed ANDAs
seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO® before expiration
                
 79
                                
of Bayer’s United States Patent Nos. 7,157,456 , 7,585,860 and 7,592,339 relating to XARELTO®. JPI is the exclusive sublicensee of the asserted patents.
The following generic companies are named defendants: Aurobindo Pharma Limited and Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. (collectively, Aurobindo);
Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Breckenridge); InvaGen Pharmaceuticals Inc. (InvaGen); Micro Labs USA Inc. and Micro Labs Ltd (collectively,
Micro); Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan); Prinston Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Sigmapharm Laboratories, LLC (Sigmapharm); Torrent Pharmaceuticals,
Limited and Torrent Pharma Inc. (collectively, Torrent). All defendants except Mylan and Sigmapharm have agreed to have their cases stayed and to be
bound by the outcome of any final judgment rendered against any of the other defendants. Trial is scheduled for March 2018.
Beginning in April 2017, JPI and Bayer Intellectual Property GmbH and Bayer AG (collectively, Bayer AG) filed patent infringement lawsuits in the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware against a number of generic companies who filed ANDAs seeking approval to market generic

Aurobindo, Taro, Torrent and Micro have agreed to have their cases stayed and to be bound by the outcome of any final judgment rendered against any of
the other defendants. The ’218 cases have been consolidated for discovery and trial, and are currently set for trial in April 2019.

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS
Like other companies in the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive
regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction with
government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is
possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.
Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation
Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were
named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical
products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average
Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in
these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state
government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed
to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,
where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. Two cases remain pending. In a case brought by
Illinois, the parties are awaiting assignment of a trial date. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor,
Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation.
Opioids Litigation
Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies,
have been named in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC®,
NUCYNTA® and NUCYNTA® ER. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI, have been filed in state
court by the state Attorneys General in Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio and Oklahoma. Complaints against the manufacturers also
have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Arkansas; California; Connecticut; Florida;
Georgia; Illinois; Kentucky; Louisiana; Mississippi; Missouri; Nevada; New Hampshire; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; Ohio; Oklahoma; Oregon;
Pennsylvania; Tennessee; Texas; Washington and West Virginia. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioids marketing practices, including
false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits
generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief. These cases are in early stages of litigation. In October 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI
were both served with a motion to consolidate 66 pending matters into a federal Multi District Litigation in the Southern District of Ohio. In December
2017, the MDL was approved in the Northern District of Ohio and there are approximately 190 cases that have been transferred to the MDL.
                
 82
                                
Johnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing
practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Tennessee and Washington. In September 2017,
Johnson & Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-
state Attorney General investigation. The multi-state coalition served Johnson & Johnson and JPI with subpoenas as part of the investigation. Johnson &
Johnson and JPI have also received requests for information from the ranking minority member of the United States Senate Committee on Homeland
Security and Governmental Affairs regarding the sales, marketing, and educational strategies related to the promotion of opioids use.
Other
In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. received an informal request
from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United
States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR™ XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court
for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies. In
February 2016, the District Court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam
relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators’ request
to file a third amended complaint. The relators’ remaining claims are now pending before the District Court.
Since October 2013, a group of State Attorneys General have issued Civil Investigative Demands relating to the development, sales and marketing of
several of DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.'s hip products. The states are seeking monetary and injunctive relief, and DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. has entered into a
tolling agreement with the states. In July 2014, the Oregon Department of Justice, which was investigating these matters independently of the other states,
announced a settlement of its ASR™ XL Hip device investigation with the State of Oregon.
In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of
the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson & Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). Johnson &
Johnson and Ethicon have since entered into a series of tolling agreements with the 47 states and the District of Columbia participating in the multi-state
investigation and have responded to Civil Investigative Demands served by certain of the participating states. The states are seeking monetary and
injunctive relief. In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon Inc. and Ethicon US, LLC alleging
violations of their consumer protection statutes. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by Kentucky in August 2016 and by Mississippi in
October 2017. Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon have entered into a new tolling agreement with the remaining 43 states and the District of Columbia.
In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD)
franchise, received a letter from the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania informing Therakos that
the United States Attorney's Office was investigating the sales and marketing of Uvadex® (methoxsalen) and the Uvar Xts® and Cellex® Systems during the
period 2000 to the present. The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson & Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the
investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013, and OCD was divested in June 2014.
Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson & Johnson retains OCD’s portion of any liability that may result from the investigation for activity that
occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. In March 2014 and March 2016, the United States Attorney’s Office requested that Johnson & Johnson produce
certain documents, and Johnson & Johnson is cooperating with those requests.
In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against
Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI). The complaint alleges that
defendants failed to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S®
Shower to Shower (a product no longer sold by JJCI) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. The parties have agreed to adjourn the trial date and
currently expect the trial to be re-scheduled to the fall of 2018.
In March 2016, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern
District of New York related to JPI’s contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers over the
                
 83
                                
period from January 1, 2006 to the present with regard to certain of JPI's pharmaceutical products. The demand was issued in connection with an
investigation under the False Claims Act.
In January 2017, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice relating to
allegations concerning the sales and marketing practices of OLYSIO®. In December 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were served with a whistleblower
lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging the off-label promotion of OLYSIO® and additional products,
including NUCYNTA®, XARELTO®, LEVAQUIN® and REMICADE®.  At this time, the federal and state governments have declined to intervene and the
lawsuit, which is related to the Civil Investigative Demand, is being prosecuted by a former company employee.  JPI filed a motion to dismiss in the United
States District Court for the Central District of California in January 2018.
In February 2017, Johnson & Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking the
production of records pertaining to payments to any 501(c)(3) charitable organization that provides financial assistance to Medicare patients. Multiple
pharmaceutical companies have publicly reported receipt of subpoenas and ongoing inquiries similar to this one and the one described below.
Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion US), received a subpoena in May 2016, with follow-up requests in June and December 2016, from the United
States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts. The subpoena seeks the production of records pertaining to Actelion US’ payments to 501(c)(3)
charitable organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients.
In March 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice regarding a False Claims Act

In April and September 2017, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts seeking documents
broadly relating to pharmaceutical copayment support programs for DARZALEX®, OLYSIO®, REMICADE®, SIMPONI®, STELARA® and
ZYTIGA®. The subpoenas also seek documents relating to Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price reporting to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid
Services related to those products, as well as rebate payments to state Medicaid agencies.
In June 2017, Johnson & Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking information
regarding practices pertaining to the sterilization of DePuy Synthes, Inc. spinal implants at three hospitals in Boston as well as interactions of Company
employees with physicians at these hospitals. Johnson & Johnson is producing documents in response to this subpoena.
From time to time, Johnson & Johnson has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to
ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information.
GENERAL LITIGATION
In June 2009, following the public announcement that Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD) had received a grand jury subpoena from the United States
Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, in connection with an investigation that has since been closed, multiple class action complaints were filed against
OCD by direct purchasers seeking damages for alleged price fixing. These cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as In re Blood Reagent Antitrust Litigation. Following the appeal and reversal of its initial grant of a motion for
class certification, on remand, the District Court in October 2015 again granted a motion by the plaintiffs for class certification. In July 2017, the Court
issued an opinion granting in part and denying in part OCD's motion for summary judgment. The Court granted summary judgment concerning allegations
of price fixing in 2005 and 2008, and denied summary judgment concerning allegations of price fixing in 2001. Trial has been set for June 2018. OCD was
divested in 2014 and Johnson & Johnson retained any liability that may result from these cases.
In June 2011, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) filed suit against Orthopaedic Hospital (OH) in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Indiana seeking a declaratory judgment that DePuy did not owe OH royalties under a 1999 development agreement. In January 2012, OH filed a breach
of contract case in California federal court, which was later consolidated with the Indiana case. In February 2014, OH brought suit for patent infringement
relating to the same technology, and that action was also consolidated with the Indiana case. In August 2017, the court denied DePuy’s motions for
summary judgment. A trial date has not been set.

In September 2011, Johnson & Johnson, Johnson & Johnson Inc. and McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division of Johnson & Johnson Inc. received a Notice
of Civil Claim filed by Nick Field in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada (the BC Civil Claim). The BC Civil Claim is a putative class action
brought on behalf of persons who reside in British Columbia and who purchased during the period between September 20, 2001 and in or about December
2010 one or more various McNeil infants' or children's over-the-counter medicines that were manufactured at the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania facility.
The BC Civil Claim alleges that the defendants violated the BC Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act, and other Canadian statutes and common
laws, by selling medicines that were allegedly not safe and/or effective or did not comply with Canadian Good Manufacturing Practices. The class
certification hearing scheduled for October 2015 was adjourned, and the Court entered a Consent Order of Dismissal in November 2017 concluding this
action. In addition, in April 2016, a putative class action was filed against Johnson & Johnson, Johnson & Johnson Sales and Logistics Company, LLC and

Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI) alleging violations of state consumer fraud statutes based on nondisclosure of alleged health risks associated
with talc contained in JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S® Shower to Shower (a product no longer sold by JJCI). Both cases seek injunctive
relief and monetary damages; neither includes a claim for personal injuries. In October 2016, both cases were transferred to the United States District Court
for the District Court of New Jersey as part of a newly created federal multi-district litigation. In July 2017, the Court granted Johnson & Johnson's and
JJCI’s motion to dismiss one of the cases. The plaintiff has appealed. In September 2017, the plaintiff in the second case voluntarily dismissed their
complaint.

billion. In 2017, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $760 million, of which $88 million was included in cost of products sold and $363 million was
included in other (income) expense. See table below for additional details. Total project costs of $2.0 billion have been recorded since the restructuring has
been announced.
Additionally, as part of the plan, the Company expects that the restructuring actions will result in position eliminations of approximately 4 to 6 percent
of the Medical Devices segment’s global workforce over the next 15 months. Approximately 2,400 positions have been eliminated of which 1,700 received
separation payments since the restructuring announcement.
The Company estimates that approximately one-half of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays, including approximately $400 million
of employee severance. Approximately one half of the cumulative pre-tax costs are non-cash, relating primarily to facility rationalization, inventory write-
offs and intangible asset write-offs.
The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under this initiative through the fiscal year ended 2017:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Johnson & Johnson
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017,
and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for and presents certain elements of
share based payments in 2016.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Abbott Medical Optics and Actelion Ltd.
from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business
combinations during 2017. We have also excluded Abbott Medical Optics and Actelion Ltd. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.
Abbott Medical Optics and Actelion Ltd. are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and
our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 1% and 1% of total assets, respectively and approximately 1% and 2% of total
revenues, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the
preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In
making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
“Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and
communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness
of its internal controls over financial reporting.
The Company acquired Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories and Actelion Ltd. and its consolidated
subsidiaries (Actelion) in February and June 2017, respectively. Actelion's total assets, excluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total revenues
represented approximately 1% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2017.
AMO's total assets, excluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total revenues represented approximately 1% and 1%, respectively, of the related
consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2017. As the acquisitions occurred in the fiscal year 2017, the scope of the
Company's assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year 2017 excluded the above mentioned
acquisitions. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the
scope in the year of acquisition.
Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Executive Vice
President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Gorsky and Caruso concluded that, as of
the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to
"Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting", and the attestation regarding internal controls over financial reporting included in
the "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" included in Item 8 of this Report.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, there were no changes in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human
resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s
financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and
operation of its financial control environment.
