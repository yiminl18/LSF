 The
California
Public
Utilities
Commission
 
The CPUC is a regulatory agency that r
egulates privately owned public utilities in California.   The CPUC has jurisdiction over the r ates and terms and conditionsof servi 
ce for the Utility's electric and natural gas dist ribution operations, electric generation, and natural g as transmission and storage services.  The CPUC alsohas jurisdiction over the Ut
ility's issuances of securities, d ispositions of utility assets and facilities, energy purchases on behalf of the Utility's electric and natural gas retail customers, 
rates of return, rates of depreciation, oversight of nuclear decommissioning, and aspects of the siting of faciliti es used in providing electricand natural gas utility s
ervice. 
The CPUC enforces state laws and regula
tions that set forth safety requirements pertaining to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of utilitygas and 
electric facilities.   The CPUC can impose penalties of up to $50,000 per day, per violation, for v iolations that occurred after January 1, 2012.  (Thestatutory maximum pena
lty for violations that occurred before January 1, 2012 is $20,000 per violation.)   The CPUC has wide discretion to determin e the amountof penalties based on the to
tality of the circumstances, including such factors as the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and thenumber of persons affect
ed; and the g ood faith of the entity ch arged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation.  The CPUC also isrequired to consider the 
appropriateness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.   
The CPUC has delegated auth 
ority to the SED to issue citat ions and impose penalties for violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports.  Underthe current gas and el 
ectric citation p rograms adopted by the CPUC in September 2016, the SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for ea ch violation, but ifit assesses a penalty for 
a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $50,000, with an administrative limit of $8 million per citationissued.  The SED may, at its discret
ion, impose p enalties on a daily basis, o r on less than a d aily basis, for violations that continued for more than one day.  TheSED has the discretion to eithe
r address each violation in a disti nct citation or to include multiple violations in a single citation regard less of whether the violat ionsoccurred in the 
same incident or are o f a similar nature. Penalty payments for citations issued pursuant to the gas and electric safety citation programs are theresponsibility of sharehold
ers of an issuer and must not be rec overed in rates or otherwis e directly or indir ectly charged to custom ers.  
The California 
State Legislature also dire cts the CPUC to implement state laws and policies, such as the laws relating to increasing renewable energy resources, thedevelopment an 
d widespread deployment of dist ributed generation and self-generation resources, the reduction of GHG emissions, the establishment of energy storage 
procurement targets , and the development  of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  T he CPU C is responsible for approving funding andadministration of sta
te-mandated public purpose programs such as energy efficiency and other customer programs.  The CPUC also conducts audits and reviews ofthe Utility’s accounting, p
erformance , and compliance w ith regulatory guidelines .  
T 
he CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between the Utility and PG&E Corporation and other affiliates, including financialconditions that require PG&E Corpor
ation’s Board of Directors to give first priority to the capit al requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary andprudent to meet the Util
ity's obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. (For more information, see “Liquidity and FinancialResour 
ces” in Item 7. MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors.)   
The
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
and
the
Californ
ia
Independent
System
Operator 
The FERC has jurisdictio 
n over the Utility's elec tric transmission revenue requ irements and rates, the licensing of substantially all of the Utility's hydroelectricgeneration facili
ties, and the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas.  The FERC regulates the interconnections of the Utility’s trans mission systems with other electric system and ge
neration facilities, the tariffs and conditions of service of regional transmission organizations and the terms and rates of wholesaleelectricity sales.  
The FERC also is charged with adopting and enfo rcing mandatory standards governing the reliabi lity of the nation’s electric transmission grid, including standards to prote
ct the nation’s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. The FERC has authority to impo 
se fines of up to $1 million pe r day for violation s of certain federal statutes and regulations. 
The CAISO is the FERC-approved regional transmiss
ion organization for the Utility’s service territory.  The CAISO controls the operation of the electric trans mission system in Californi
a and provides open access transmission service on a non - discriminatory basis.  The CAISO also is responsible for planningtransmission system addit
ions, ensuring the maintenance of adequate reserves of gen erating capacity, and e nsuring that the reliab ility of the transmission system ismaintained.

 The
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
 
The NRC oversees the licensing, constru
ction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, including the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the Utility’s reti
red nuclear generating unit at Humboldt Bay.  (See “Electric ity Resources” below.)  NRC regulations require extensive monitoringand review of the safety, r
adiological, seismic, environmental, and security aspec ts of these facilit ies.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authorityto impose fines or to forc
e a shutdown of a nuclear plant, or both.  NRC safety and security requirements have, in the past, necessitated substantial capitalexpenditures at 
Diablo Canyon, and substantial capi tal expenditures could be required in the future.   (For more information abou t Diablo Canyon, see “RegulatoryMatters – Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plan
t” in Item 7. MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors below.) 
Third-
party
m
onitor 
On April 12, 2017, the Utility retain
ed a third-party monitor at the Utility’s expense as part of its compliance with the sentencing terms of the Utility’s January 27, 2017 federal crimina
l conviction, which sentenced the Utility to, among other th ings, a five-year corpor ate probation period and oversight by a third-party monitorfor a period of five yea
rs, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years.   The goal of the monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonableand appropriate steps to m
aintain the safety of its gas and el ectric operations and maintains effective ethics, compliance , and safety related incentive programs ona Utility-wide basis. 
  (For additional informa tion see Item 1A. Risk Factors.) 
Other
Regula
tors
The CEC 
is the state's primary energy policy and planning agency.  The CEC is responsible for licensing all thermal power plants over 50 MW within California. The CEC also is responsible for fore
casts of future energy needs used by the CPUC in determining the adequacy of the utilities' electricity procurement plans and for adopting building and appli
ance energy efficiency requirements.
The CARB 
is the state agency respons ible for setting and monitoring GHG and other e mission limits.  The CARB is also responsible for adopting and enforcingregulations to implem
ent state law requirements to gradually reduce GHG emissions in California.  (See “Environmental Regulation - Air Quality and ClimateChange” below.)
 
In addition, the Utility obt
ains perm its, authorizations, and l icenses in connection with the construction and operation of the Utility's generation facilities,electricity transmission lines,
 natural gas transportation pipelines, and gas compressor station facilities.  The Utility also perio dically obtains permits, authorizations, and lic
enses in connection with distribution of electricity and natural gas that grant the Utility rights to occupy and/or use public property for theoperation of the Utility's bus
iness and to conduct certain relat ed operations.  The Utility has franchise agreements with approximately 300 cities and counties thatpermit the Utility to install
, operate, and maintain the Utility's electric and natural gas facilities in the public streets and highway s.  In exchange for the right to use public streets and 
highway s, the Utility pays annual fe es to the cities and counties.  In most cases, the Utility’s franchise agreements are for an indeterminate term,with no expiration date. 
  (For additional informa tion see Item 1A. Ris k Factors.)

 Ratemaking
Mechanisms
 
The Utility’s rates for 
electric and natural gas utility s ervices are set at levels that are intended to allow the Utility to recover its costs of providing service and areturn on invested capit
al (“cost-of-service ratemaking”).  Before setting rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct proceedings to determine the annual amount thatthe Utility will be author
ized to collect from its customers (“revenue requirements”).  The U tility’s revenue requirements c onsist primarily of a base amount set to enable the Utility to 
recover its reasonabl e operating expenses ( e.g., maintenance, adminis tration and general expenses) and capital costs ( e.g., depreciation, tax, and financing expen 
ses).  In addition, the CPUC authorizes th e Utility to collect revenues to recover costs that the Utility is allowed to “pass-through” to customers 
(referred to as “Uti lity Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Item 7. MD&A) , including its co sts to procure electr icity, natural gas andnuclear fuel, to admin
ister public purpose and customer programs, and to decommission its nuclear facilities. 
The 
Utility’s rate of return on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceeding s.  Similarly, the authori zed rate of return on all other Utilityassets is set in the CPUC’s cost of capi
tal proceeding.  Other than its electric transmission and certain gas transmission and storage revenues, the Utility’s baserevenues are “decoupled” f 
rom its sales volume.  Regula tory balancing accounts, or revenue adjustment mechanisms, are designed to allow the Uti lity to fully collect its authori
zed base revenue requirements.  As a result, the Utility’s base revenues are not impacted by fluctuations in sales resulting from rate changes orusage.  The Utility’s earnings p
rimarily depend on its ability to manage its base operating and capital costs (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs thatImpacted Earnings” in I
tem 7. MD&A) within its authorized base revenue requirements.  
Due to the seasonal nature of 
the Utility’s business and rate design, customer electric bills are generally higher during summer months (May – October) because ofhigher demand, driven by air 
conditioning loads.   Customer bills related to gas servic e generally increase during the winter months (November – March) toaccount for the gas peak due 
to heating. 
During 201 
7 , the CPUC continued to implement state law requirements to reform residential electric rates to more closely ref lect the utiliti es’ actual costs ofservice, reduce cross-subs
idization among customer rate classe s, implement new rules for net energy metering (which currently allow  certain self-generatingcustomers to receive b
ill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate) , and allow customers to have gr eater control over their energy use.  (See “ Regulatory Matters 
” in Item 7. MD&A for more information on specifi c CPUC proceedings . ) 
From time to time, the CPUC may use in
centive ratemaking mechanisms that provide the Utility an opportun ity to earn some additional revenues.   For example, the Utility has earned in
centives for the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs.  (See “Regulatory Matters – 2015 – 2016 Energy EfficiencyIncentives Awards” 
in Item 7. MD&A.)  
Base

General
Rate
Cases

The GRC is the primary proceeding in whi
ch the CPUC determines the amount of base revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect fromcustomers to recover the 
Utility’s anticipated co sts, including return on rat e base, related to its electric distribution, natura l gas distribution, and Utili ty- owned electric 
generation operations.  The CPUC genera lly conducts a GRC every three or four years.  The CPUC approves the annual revenue requir ements for the first year (or “test year
”) of the GRC period and typically authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRCperiod (known as “attrition y
ears”).  Attrition year rate adjustments are generally provided for  cost increases related to increases in invested capital and inflation. Parties in the Utility's GRC include 
the ORA and TURN, who generally represent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as a myriad of other intervenors who represent othe
r business, community, customer, environmental, and union interests.  The Utility plans to file the 20 20 GRC in the third quarter of 2018.  
In December 2014, t he CPUC established two new procedures concerning safety-related act ivities, the Safety Model Assessment Proce eding and theRAMP, preceding a utility’s GRC 
. The purpose of the Safety Model Assessment Proceeding is to undertake a compreh ensive analysis of each utility’s risk-baseddecision making approach.  
The RAMP submit tal includes a utility’s prioritization of the risks it is facing , and a prioritization of  risk mitigation alternatives, aswell as a risk mitigat
ion plan.  The Utility filed its first RA MP submittal with the CPUC on November 30, 2017.

Rate
Cases
 
The CPUC determines the Utility’s au
thorized revenue requirements and rat es for its natural gas transmission and storage services in the GT&S rate case.   TheCPUC generally conducts a GT&S rate case 
every three or four years.   Similar to the GRC, t he CPUC approves the annual revenue requi rements for the fir st year (or “test year”) of 
the GT&S rate case period and typically determin es annual increases in revenue requirements for attrition years of the GT&S rate case period.  Parties in the Utility's GT&S ra
te case include the ORA and TURN, who generally repre sent the overall inte rests of residential customers, as well as otherintervenors who represent oth

Cost
of
Capital
Proceedings
 
The CPUC periodically conducts a cost of 
capit al proceeding to authorize  the Utility's capital structure and rates of return for its electric generation, electric andnatural gas distribution, 
and natural gas transmission and storage rate base.  The CPUC has authorized the Utility’s capital structure through 2019, consisting of 52% common equity, 47% long-te
rm debt, and 1% preferred stock.  The CPUC also set the authorized ROE through 2017 at 10.40% and 10.25% beginning on January 1, 2018 and reset the cost o
f debt to 4.89% .  The CPUC adopted an adjust ment mechanism to al low the Utility’s capital structure and ROE to be adjustedif the utility bond index ch
anges by certain thresholds on an annual basis.

Rate
Cases
The FERC determines the amount of au
thorized revenue requirement s , including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect inrates in the TO rate cas
e.  The Utility has historically file d a TO rate case every year.  The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on therequested revenue requi
rement, subject to refund, before the FERC has issued a final decision.  These FERC-approved rates are included by the CPUC in t he Utility's retail electric rates and 
by the CAISO in its Transmission Access Charges to whol esale customers .  ( For more information, s ee “ Regulatory Matters – Transmission Owner 
Rate Cases” in Item 7. MD&A.)  The Utility also recovers a portion of its rev enue requirements for its wholesale electric transmission coststhrough charges collect
ed under specific contracts with wholesale transmission customers that the Utility entered into before the CAISO began its operations. These wholesale customers a
re cha rged individualized ra tes based on the terms of their contracts.

California investor-ow
ned electric utilities are responsible for procuring electr ical cap acity required to meet bundled customer demand, plus appli cable reservemargins, that are not sati

urces, including certain electricity procured from third parties into the wholesale market, to meet customer demand according to which resourcesare the least expensiv
e (i.e., using the principles of “least-cost dispatch”).  In addition, the utilities are required to obtain CPUC approval of the ir bundled customer procurement plans based 
on long-term demand fore casts.  In October 2015, the CPUC approved the Utility’s most recent bundled customer procurement plan.  Itwas revised since its init
ial approval an d will remain in effe ct as revised until superseded by a subsequent CPUC-approved plan. 
California law allows ele
ctric utilities to recover the costs incurred in compliance with their CPUC-approved bundled customer procurement plans without further after-the-fac
t reasonableness review by the CPUC .  The CPUC may disallow c osts associated with elec tricity purchases if the costs were not incurred in compliance with the CPUC-approved plan o
r if the CPUC determines that the utility failed to foll ow the principles of least -cost dispatch.  Additionally, the CPUC may disallow the cost of rep
lacement power procured due to unplanned outages at Utility-owned generation facilities. 
12
 

 The Utility recovers its 
electric procurement costs annual ly primarily t hrough the energy resource r ecovery account .  (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolida tedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8.)  Each year, the CPUC reviews the Utility ’s forecasted procurement costs related to power purchase agreements, derivativeinstruments 
, GHG emissions costs, and generation fue l expense, and approves a forecasted r evenue requirement.  The CPUC may adjust the Utility’s ret ail electric rates more frequently if the f
orecasted aggregate over-collections or under-collections in the energy reso urce recovery account exceed  5% of its prior year electric procurement and 
U tility-owned generation revenues.  The CPUC performs an annual compliance review of the transactions recorded in the energy resourcerecovery account.
 
The CPUC has approved variou 
s power purchase agreements that the Utility has entered into with third parties in accordance with the Utility’s CPUC-approvedprocurement plan, 
to meet mandatory renewable energy targets , and to comply with resource adequacy requi rements.  (For more info rmation, s ee “Electric Utility Operations – Elect

Natural
Gas
Procurement
,
Storage,
 and
Transportation
Costs  
The Utility recovers the 
cost of gas used in generation facilities  as a cost of electricity that is recovered annually through retail electric rates.  
The Utility sets the 
natural gas procurement rate for small commercial and residential customers (referred to as “core” customers) monthly, based on the forecasted costs of natural gas, core p
ipeline capacity and storage costs.  The Utility recovers the cost of gas purchased on behalf of core customers as well as the cost ofderivative instruments 
for its core gas portfol io, through its retail gas rates, subject to limits as set forth in its  core procurement incentive mechanism describedbelow 
.  The Utility reflects t he difference between actual natural gas purchase costs and forecasted natural gas purchase costs in several natural gas balancin g accounts, with under-colle
ctions and over-collections taken into account in subsequent monthly rate change s.  
The 
core procurement incentive mechanism protects the Utility again st after-the-fact reasonableness reviews of its gas procurement costs for i ts core gas portfolio .  Under the 
core procurement inc entive mechanism , the Utility’s natural g as purchase costs for a fixed 12-month period are compared to an aggregate market-based benchmark based on a weight
ed average of published monthly and daily natu ral gas price indices at the points where the Utility typically purchases naturalgas.  Costs that fall within a to
lerance band, which is 99% to 102% of the commodity benchmark, are considered reasonable and are fully recovered in customers’rates.  One-ha 
lf of the costs above 102% of th e benchmark are recoverable in customers’ rates, and the Utility's customers receive in their rates 80% of anysavings resulting from the Ut
ility’s cost of natural gas that is less than 99% of the benchmark.  The Utility ret ains the remaining amoun t of these savings as incentive revenues, subje
ct to a cap equal to 1.5% of total natural gas commodity costs.  While this mechanism remains in place, changes in the price of naturalgas, consistent with the mark
et-based benchmark, are not expected to materially im pact net income. 
The Utility incurs transpor
tation costs under various agreements with interstate and Canadian third-party transportation service providers.  These providerstransport natural gas f
rom the points at which the Utility takes deliv ery of natural gas (typically in Canada, the U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern UnitedStates) to the points at which 
the Utility's natural gas transportation system begins.   These agreements are governed by FERC-approved tar iffs that detail rates, rules, and terms of servi
ce for the provision of natural gas transportation services to the Utility on interstate and Canadian pipelines.  The FERC approves the United States tariffs 
that shippers , including the Utility, pay for pip eline service , and the applicable Canadi an tariffs are approved by the National Energy Board , a Canadian regulatory agen
cy .  The transportation costs th e Utility incurs under these agreements are recovered through CPUC-approved rates as core natural gaspr 
ocurement costs or as a cost of electricity.

  These programs relate to energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, energy research and development, and other matters.  Additionally, the CPUC has authorized the Ut
ility to provide a discount rate for low-income custom ers, known as California Alterna te Rates for Energy(“CARE”), which is subsidized by the Utili
ty’s other customers.

 Nuclear
Decommissioning
Costs

The Utility's nuclear power f
acilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and the retired facility at Hum boldt Bay.  Nuclear decommission ing requires the saferemoval of nuclear facilities from 
service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of theproperty for unrestric
ted use.  Nuclear d ecommissioning costs are collected in advance through rates and are held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used forthe eventual decommiss
ioning of each nuclear unit.  The Utility files an appl ication with the CPUC every three years requesting approv al of the Utility’s updated estimated decommiss
ioning costs and any rate change necessa ry to fully fund the nuclear decommissioning trusts to the levels needed to decommission theUtility’s nuclear plants.
 
On 
January 11 , 201 8 , the CPUC approved the retire ment of Diablo Canyon ’s two nuclear power reacto r units by 2024 and 2025 .   (For more information, see “Regulatory

ustomers in its service territory.  Customers also can obtain electricity from alternative providers such as municipalities or CCAs, as well as from self-generation resources, such 
as rooftop solar installations. 
The Utility 
has continued to invest in its vision for a future electric grid which w ill allow customers to choose new, advanced energy supply technologies andservices to meet their needs
 consistent with safe, reliable and affordable electric service.  In 2017, the Ut ility continued to work on the foundation for its programto deploy up to 7,500 charging stations.

Renewable
Energy
Resources
  
California law establish
ed a n RPS that requires load-se rving entities, such as the Utility, to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy they deliver to theircustomers 
.  In October 2015, the California Gove rnor signed SB 350, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015 into law. SB 350 became effective January 1, 2016, and increases the 
amount of renewable energy that must be delivered by most load-serving ent ities, including the Util ity, to their customers from33% of their total annua
l retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020 compliance period, to 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2028- 2030 compliance period, and in each 
three-ye ar com pliance period there after, unless changed by legislative action.  SB 350 provides compliance flexibility and waivermechanisms, including inc
reased flexibility to apply excess renewable energy procurement in one compliance period to future compliance perio ds.  The Utility will incur additional cos
ts to procure renewable energy to meet the new renewable energy targets, which the Utility expects will continue to be recoverable fromcustomers as “pass-through” 
costs.  The Utility also may be subject to penaltie s for failure to mee t the higher targets.  The CPUC is required to open a new rulemaking proceeding to 
adopt regulations to implement the higher renewable targets.   
Renewable generation resour
ces, for purposes of the RPS requirements , include bioenergy such as biogas and biomass, cert ain hydroelectric facilities (30 MW orless), wind, solar, and geotherm
al energy.  During 201 7 , 33.1 % of the Utility’s energy deliveries were from renewable energy sources, exceeding the annual RPStarget of 2 
7 %.  Approxima tely 29 % of the renewable energy delivered to the Utility’s customers was purchased from non-QF third parties.   Additionalrenewable resources were p
rovided by QFs ( 1.9 %), the Utility’s small hydroelectric facilities ( 1.7 %), and the Utility’s solar facilit ies ( 0.5 %).

As required by California law, th
e CPUC has opened a proceeding to establish a multi-year energy storage procurement framework, including energy storageprocurement targets 
to be achieved by each load-serving entity under the CPUC jurisdiction, including the Utility.  Under the adopted energy storage procurementframework, the Utility is 
required to procure 580 MW of qualifying storage capacity by 2020, with all energy storage projects required to be operational by the end of 2024.
 
The CPUC also adopted biennial interi
m storage targets for the Utility, beginning in 2014 and ending in 2020.  Under the adopted framework, the Utility isrequired to conduct bienni
al competitive request for offer to he lp meet its interi m storage targets.  
The Utility’s 201 
7 energy storage target is 120 MW , plus an additional  amount to replace failed and rejected agreements for a total of approximately 160 MW . On November 30, 2016, the Utility issued its 2016 
request for offer . On December 1, 2017, the Utility submitted contracts for 165 MW of energy storage projectsfor CPUC review.  One of the projects is a 20 MW d

Electricity
Transmission

  
At December 
  31, 201 7 , the Utility owned approximately 1 9 , 200 circuit miles of interconnected transmission lines operating at voltages ranging from 60 kV to 500 kV.  The Utility al 
so operated 9 2 electric transmission substations with a capacity of approximately 64, 7 00 M VA.  The Utility’s electric transmissionsystem is interconnect
ed with electric power systems in the Western Electricity Coordinating Co uncil, which includes many western states, Alberta and Br itishColumbia, and parts of Mexico.
 
Decisions about expansions and main
tenance of the transmission system can be influenced by decisions of our regulators. For example, in 2013, the Utility,MidAmerican Transmission, LLC, a 
nd Citizens Energy Corporation were s elected by the CAISO to jointly develop a new 230-kV transm ission line to address thegrowing power demand in the Fresno, Mader
a and Kings counties area.  However, the 2022 in-service dat e for the 70-mile line was subse quently postponed by the CAISO, and the CAISO has 
placed the project on hold.   The Utility has stopped all work on the project pending a decision from the CAISO that could defer orcancel the project.  A de
cision by the CAISO is expected by March 2018.  In addition, as a part of the CAISO's 2016-2017 planning efforts, the CAISO found that a number of lower-voltage 
transmission projects were no long er required and recommended cancelling or requir ing further review in the 2017-2018 planningcycle.
 
17
 

 Throughout 
201 7 , the Utility upgraded several substations and re-conductored a number of transmission lines to improve maintenance and system flexibility,reliability and saf
ety.  The Utility expects to undertake various additional transmission projects over the next several years to upgrade and expand the capacity ofits transmission system to s
ecure access to renewable generation r esources and replace aging or obsolet e equipment and improve system reliability.  The Utilityalso has taken steps to improv
e the physica l security of its trans mission substations and equipment. 
Electricity
Distribution
 
The Utility's 
electric distribution network consists of a pproximately 1 07 , 2 00 circuit miles of distribution lines (of which approximately 20% are undergroundand approxima 
tely 80% are overhead), 5 9 transmission switching substations, and 605 distribution substations, with a capacity of approximately 3 1 , 8 00 MVA. The Utility’s distribution n
etwork interconnects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distrib ution substations, where equipmen t reduces thehigh-voltage transmissio 
n voltages to lower voltages, r anging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the Utility’s customers. 
These distribution substations s
erve as the central hubs for th e Utility’s electric distribution network.  Emanating from each substation are primary and secondarydistribution lines connec
ted to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users.  In some cases, the Ut ilitysells electricity from its distrib
ution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity.  The Utility operates el ectric distributioncontrol center 
facilit ies in Concord , Roc klin, and Fresno , California ; t hese control centers form a key part of the Utility’s efforts to create a smarter, moreresilient grid.
 
In 2017, the Utility continued to d
eploy its f ault l ocation, i solation, and s ervice r estoration circuit technology that involves the rapid operation of smart switchesto reduce the duration of 
customer outages.  Another 92 circuits were outfitted with this equipment, bringing the total deployment to 882 of the Utility’s 3,200distribution circuits.  Th
e Utility plans to con tinue performing work to imp rove the reliability and safety of its electric distribution operations in 2018.

Natural
Gas
Utility
Operations
 
The Utility provides
 natural gas transportation services to “core” customers (i.e., small commercial and residential customers) and to “non-core” customers (i.e.,industrial, large commerci 
al, and natural gas-fired electric  generation facilities) that are connected to the Utility’s gas system in its service territory.   Corecustomers can purchase na
tural gas procurement service (i.e. ,
 natural gas supply) from either the Utility or non-utility third-par ty gas procurement serviceproviders (referred to as c
ore transport agents).   When core customers purchase gas supply from a core transport agent, the Utility continues to provide gasdelivery, metering and billi
ng services to customer s.     When the Utility provides both transportation and procurement services, the Utility refers to the combinedservice as “bundled” natu
ral gas service.   Currently, more th an 95% o f core customers, representing approximately 80 % of the annual core market d emand, receive bundled natural ga
s service from the Utility. 
The Utility 
generally does not provide procurement s ervice to non-core customers, who must purchase their gas supplies from third-party suppliers , unless the customer is a natural g
as-fired gene ration facility th at the Utility has a power purchase agreement with that includes its generation fuel expense .  The Utility offers backbone gas transm
ission, gas delivery (local transmission and distribution), and gas storage services as separate and dist inct services to its non- corecustomers. 
  Access to the Utility's backbone gas transmission system is available for all natural gas marketers and shippers, as well as non-core customers.   TheUtility also delivers gas 
to off-system customers ( i.e ., outside of the Utility’s servic e territory) and to third-party natural gas storage customers.

 Natural
Gas
Supplies
 
The Utility can receiv
e natural gas from all the major natural gas basins in western North America, including basins in western Canada, the Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern United States.  The Ut
ility can also receive natural gas from fields in California.  The Ut ility purchases natural gas to serve its core customersdirectly from produce
rs and marketers in both Canada and the United States. The contract lengths and na tural gas sources of the Utility’s portfolio of natural gaspurchase contracts have 
varied generally based on marke t conditions.  During 201 7 , the Utility purchased appr oximately 291,100 MMcf o f natural gas (net of the sale of e 
xcess supply of gas).  Substantially all of this natural gas was purchased under contracts with a term of one year or less.  The Utility’s largestindividual supplier repr
esented approximately 14% of the total natural g as volume the Utility purchased durin g 201 7 . 
Natural
Gas
System
Assets
 
The Utility owns and operates an in
tegrated natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution system that includes most of northern and central California.  AtDecember 31, 201 
7 , the Utility’s natural gas system consisted of approximately 42, 800 miles of distribution pipelines, over 6, 4 00 miles of backbone and localtransmission pipelines, and v
arious storage facilities.  The Utility owns and operates eigh t natural gas compressor stations on its backbone trans mission system andone small station on its lo
cal transmission system that are used to move gas through the Utility’s pipelines.  The Utility’s backbone trans mission system, composedprimarily of Lines 300, 400, and 401, is u 
sed to transport gas from th e Utility’s interconnection with interstate pipelines, other local distribution companies, andCalifornia gas fields to 
the Utility’s local transmission and distribution systems. 
The Utility has firm tran
sportation agreements f or delivery of natural g as from western Canada to the United States-Canada border with TransCanada NOVA GasTransmission, 
  Ltd. interconnecting downstrea m with TransCanada Foothills Pipe Lines   Ltd., B.C. System.  The Foothills system interconn ects at the bo rder to the pipeline system owned by Gas Trans
mission Northwest, LLC, which provides natural gas transportation services to a point of interconnection with the Utility’snatural gas transporta
tion system on the Oregon-California border near Malin, Oregon. The Utility also has firm transportation agreements with Ruby Pipeline,LLC to transport 
natural gas from the U.S . Rocky Mountains to the interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of Malin,O 
regon, at the Calif ornia border.  Similarly, the Utility has firm transportation agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Company, LLC and El Paso Natural Ga s Company to transport 
natural gas from supply points in the Southwestern United States to interconnection points wi th th e Utility's natural gas t ransportationsystem in the area of Cal
ifornia near Topock, Arizona.  The Utility also has a transportation agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company to transportgas from the U.S. Rocky Mountains to the int
erconnection po int with the Utility’s natu ral gas system in the area of Daggett, California.  ( For more informationregarding the Utility’s n
atural gas transportation agreements, see Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. )  
20
 

 The Utility o 
wns and operates three underground n atural gas storage fields and has a 25% interest in a fourth storage field, all of which are connected to theUtility’s transmission syst
em.   The Utility owns and operates compressors and other facilities at these storag e fields that are used to inject gas into the fields forstorage and later withdr
awal.   In addition, four independent storage operators are interconnected to the Utility's northern California transmission system.   Changes to 
gas storage safety requirements by DOGGR have led the Utility to develop and propose in its 2019 GT&S rate case appli cation a natural gas storage strategywhich includes the discontinua
tion (through closure or sale) of operations at two gas storage fields.   (For more information, see “ R egulatory Matters ” in Item 7.MD&A.)
 
In 2017, the Utility continued upgr
ading transmission pipeline to allow for the use of in-line inspection tools and continued its work on the final NTSB recommendation 
from its San Bruno investigation to hydrostatical ly test all high consequence pipel ine mileage.  The Utility currently plans to complete this NTSBrecommendation by 2022 for r
emaining short pipeline segments  that include tie-in pieces, fittings or smaller diameter off-takes from the larger transmission pipelines.

in
the
Electricit
y
Industry 
California law allows
 qualifying non-residential electric customers of investor-owned electric utilities to purchase electricity from energy service providers rather than from the utilit
ies up to certain annual and overall GWh limits that have been specified for each utility.  This arrangement is known as “direct access.”  Inaddition, California law pe
rmits cities, counties, and certain oth er public agencies th at have qualified to be come a CCA to generate and/or purchase electricity fortheir local residen
ts and businesses.  By law, a CCA can procure electricity for all of its residents and businesses that do not a ffirmatively elect to continue to receive electr 
icity generated or procured by a utility.  
21
 

 The Utility continues to provid
e transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services to direct access customers, although these customers can choose to obtainmetering and billing service
s from their energy service provider.  The CCA customers continue to obtain transmission, distribution, metering, and billing servicesfrom the Utility.  In addi
tion to collecting charges for transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services that it provides, the Ut ility is able to collect charges intended to recover the g
eneration-related costs that the Utility incurred on behalf of direct access and CCA customers while they were the Utility’s customers. The Utility remains the 
electricity provider of last resort f or these customers.   
The Utility is also impac
ted by the increasing viability of distributed generation and energy storage.  The levels of self-generation of electricity by customers(primarily solar ins
tallations) and the us e of customer net ener gy met ering (“NEM”), which allows self -generating customers to receive bill credits at the fullretail rate, ar
e increasing.  These factors result in a shift of cost responsibility for grid and related services to other customers of the Utility.  For examp le, in creasing levels of sel
f-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customersto receive bill cr
edits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pre ssure on remaining customers.  N ew rules and rates became effective for newNEM customers of the Utility in De
cember 2016.  New NEM customers are required to pay an interconnection fee, comply with time of use rates, and are requiredto pay certain non-bypassabl 
e charges to help fund some of the costs of low income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay.  Significantlyhigher bills for rema
ining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customers as they may seek alternative energy providers.  The CPUC has indicated that it in
tends to revisit these rules in 2019. 
Further, in some circumst
ances, governmental entities such as cities and irrigation districts, which have authority under the state constitution or state statute toprovide retail electric service, may
 seek to acquire the Utility’s distribution facilities, generally through eminent domain.  These same entities may, and sometimesdo, construct duplicate dis
tribution facilities to serve existing or new Utility customer s.  
The effect of such types of 
retail competition generally is to reduce the amount of electricity purchased by customers from the Utility.  
The Utility also competes 
for the opportunity to develop and construct certain types of electric transmission fa cilities within, or interco nnected to, its serviceterritory through a comp
etitive biddin g process managed by the CAISO.   The FERC's transmission planning require ments rules, effective in 2011, removed theincumbent public utili
ty transmission owners' fede rally-based right of first ref usal to construct certain new transmission facilities and mandated regional andinterregional trans
mission planning.  In 2014, the FERC approved the CAISO's process for regional planning and competitive solicitations and the C AISO's interregional planning p
rocess.

Environmental
Regulation

The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and requirements rel ating to the protection of the environment and the safety andhealth of the Utility's pe
rsonnel and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous andradioactive 
substances; the discharge o f pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the re porting and reduction of CO ­ 2 and other GHG emissions; the transportation,handling, storage and disposal of sp
ent nuclear fuel; and the environmental impacts of land use, includi ng endangered species and habi tat protection. 

 Thepenalties for violat
ion of these laws and requirements can be severe and may include significant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions.  These laws andrequirements also may 
require the Utility, u nder certain circu mstances, to interrupt or curtail operations.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.)  Generally, the Utilityrecovers 
most of the costs of complying wi th environmental laws and regulations in the Utility's rates, subject to reasonableness review. Environmental costs associated with the cle
an-up of most sites that contain hazardous substances are subject to a ratemaking mechanism described in Note 13 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8 .  
22
 

 Hazardous
Waste
Compliance
and
Re
mediation 
The Utility's facilit
ies are subject to various regulations adopted by the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, in cluding the Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct and the Comprehensive Environm
ental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended.  The Utility is also subject to the regulations adoptedby 
other federal agenc ies responsible for impl ementing federal environment al laws.  The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulationsadopted by the State of Cal 
ifornia and various stat e and local agencies.  These federal and state laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous substanceon the (1) owner or operator of 
the site where the release occurred, (2) on companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the haz ardous substances, and(3) in some cases, their 
corporate successors.  Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act , these persons (known as“potentially responsible 
parties”) may be jointly an d severally liable fo r the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, monitoring and paying for the harm caused to natural resour
ces, and paying for the costs of health studies. 
The Utility has a comprehens
ive program in place to comply with these fed eral, state, and loca l laws and regulations.  Under federal and Californ ia laws, theUtility may be responsible 
for remediation of hazardous substances even if it did not deposit those substances on the site.  The Utility’s remediation activities areovers 
een by the California DTSC , several California r egional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.  The Utility hasincurred significant enviro
nmental remediation liabilities associated with former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sit es, gas gathering sites, sites wherenatural gas compressor st
ations are located, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous substances.  Groundwater atthe Utility’s Hinkley a 
nd Topock natural gas compressor s tations contains hexavalent chromium as a result of the Utility’s past operating practices.  The Utility isresponsible for remedi
ating this groundwater contamination and for abating the effects of the contamination on the environment.  
For more information ab
out environmental remediation liabilities, see Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
Air
Quality
and
Climate
Change
 
The Utility's 
electric generation plants, natur al gas pipeline op erations, vehicle fleet, and fuel storag e tanks are subject to numerous air pollution control laws,including the federal Cl
ean Air Act, as well as state and local statutes.  These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, those contributing to t he formation of ground-leve
l ozone, CO 2 , sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), mono-nitrogen oxide (NO x ), particulate matter, and other GHG emissions. 
Federal
Regulation
 
At the federal level, 
the EPA is charged with implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air Act.  Although there have been sever al legislative attempts toaddress climate chang
e through imposition of nationwide regulatory limits on GHG emissions, comprehensive federal legislation has not yet been enacted.  In theabsence of federal l
egislative action, the EPA has used its existing authori ty under the Clean Air Act to address GHG emissions. 
The federal administ
ration of President Donald Trump has led to significant uncertainty with regard to what further actions may occur regarding climate change atthe 
federal level.  Upon taking office, President Trump issued an executive order to freeze all regulations issued in the 60 days preceding his inauguration anddirected the EPA and the Whit
e House to remove climate change-related materials and web pages.   In October 2017, the EPA issued a notice of proposedrulemaking to formally repeal t
he Clean Power Plan regulations.  The Trump administration is expected to take further action to substantially limit climate relatedregulatory and funding act
ivities.  In lig ht of the policy reversal  at the federal level, the State of California has indicated that it intends to continue and enhance itsleadership on climate change
 nationally and globally. 
23
 

 State
Regulation

California 
’s AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, provides for the gradual reduction of s tate-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.  TheCARB has approved various regulations 
to achieve the 2020 targe t , including GHG emissions reporting and a s tate-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade program that sets gradually decl
ining limits (or “caps”) on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted by major GHG emission sources within different sectors of theeconomy.  The cap 
- and-trade program’s first compliance period, which began on January 1, 2013, applied t o the electric generation and large indus trial sectors. The next compliance per
iod, which began on January 1, 2015, expanded to include the natural gas and transportation sectors, effectively covering all theeconomy’s major sectors un
til 2020.  The Utili ty’s compliance obliga tion as a natural gas supplier applies to the GHG emissions attributable to the combustion ofnatural gas delivered to t
he Utility’s customers other than natural gas delivery customers that are separately regulated as covered entities and have their own compliance obligation.  Dur
ing each year of the program, the CARB issues emission allowances (i.e., the rights to emit GHGs) equal to the amount of GHGemissions allowed for that y
ear.  Emitters can obtain allowances fro m the CARB at qu arterly auctions or f rom third parties or exchanges.  Emitters may alsosatisfy a portion of thei
r compliance obligation through the purchase of offset credits; e.g., credits for GHG reductions achieved by third parties (such aslandowners, livestock owner 
s, and farmers) that oc cur outside of the emitters’ facilities through CARB-qualified offset projects such as refo restation or biomass projects.  SB 32 (2016) requires tha
t CARB ensure a 40% reduction in greenhouse g ases b y 2030 compared to 1990 levels.  I n 2017, AB 398 extended the cap- and-trade program to 2030. 
  The Utility expects all costs and revenues associated with the GHG cap-and-trade program to b e passed through to customers.  The California RPS program that requ
ires the utilities to gradually inc rease the amount of ren ewable energy delivered to their customers is also expected to help reduceGHG emissions in California.

Climate
Change
Resilience
Strategies 
During 201 
7 , the Utility continued its programs to mitigate the impact of the Utility’s o perations (including custo mer energy usage) on the environment and toplan for the actions tha
t it will need to take to increase its resilience in light of the likely impacts of climate cha nge on the Utility’s operations.  The Utilityregularly reviews the 
most relevant scientific literature o n climate change such as rising sea level s, major storm events , increasing temperature s and heatwaves, wildfires, drought and land subsiden
ce , to help the Utility  identify and evaluate climate change-related risks and develop the necessary resilience strategies.  The Utility maintains em
ergency response plans and procedures to address a range of near-term risks, including wildfires , extreme storms, and  heat waves and uses its risk-assessment process to p
rioritize infra structure investments for l onger-term risks associated with climate change.  The Utility also engages with l eaders frombusiness, government, academ
ia, and non-profit organizations to share information and plan for the future. 
The Utility is working to 
better understand the curre nt and future impacts of climat e change.  In 2017, the Utility f iled its first RAMP submittal with the CPUC, which examined Utility saf
ety risks. The Climate Resilience RAMP model indicated potential additional Utility safety con sequences due to climat e change,including in the near te
rm.  The Utility is conducting foundational work to help anticipate and plan for evolving conditions in terms of weather and c limate-changerelated events.  This work will gu
ide efforts to design a Ut ility-wide climat e change risk integration strategy.  This strategy will inform resource planning andinvestment, operational deci
sions, and potential additional programs to identify and pursue mitigations that will incorporate the resilience and safety of the Utility’s assets, infrastructur
e, operations, employees, and customers. 
With respect to electric operation
s, climate scientists project that, sometime in the next several decades, climate change will lead to increased electricity demanddue to more ex 
treme, persistent, and frequent hot weather.  The Utility believes its str ategies to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficien cy and demandresponse programs, infrast
ructure improvements, and the use of rene wable energy and energy storag e are effective strategies for a dapting to the expected ch angesin demand for electricity.  
The Utility is making substant ial investments to build a more modern and resilient system that can better withstand extreme weather andrelated emergencies. 
Over the long-term, the Utility also faces the risk of higher flooding and inundation potential at coasta l and low elevation facilities due to sealevel rise 
combined with high tides, storm runoff and storm surges.   As the state continues to fa ce increased risk of wildfire, t he Utility’s vegetation managementactivities 
will continue to play an impo rtant role to help reduce the risk of wildfi re and its impact on electric and gas facilities.  
C 
limate scientists predict that climate change will result in varying temperatures and le vels of precipitation in t he Utility’s service territory .  This could, in turn, affect the Utility
’s hydroelectric generation.  To plan for this potential change, the Utility is engaging with state and local stakeholders and is also adoptingstrategies suc 
h as maintaining higher wint er carryover reservoir storage levels, reducing discretionary reservoir water releases, and collaborating on resea rch andnew modeling tools.
 
24
 

 With respect to natur
al gas operations, both safety-related pipeline strength testin g and normal pipeline ma intenance and operations release the GHG methane intothe atmosphere.  The Utili
ty has taken steps to reduce the release of methane by implementing techniques including drafting and cross-compression, which reducethe pressure and v 
olume of natural gas within p ipelines prior to venting.   In addition, the Utility continues to achieve reductions in m ethane emissions byimplementing improve
ments in leak detection and repair, upgrades at metering and regulating stations, and maintenance and replacement of oth er pipelinematerials.
 
Emissions
Data

PG&E Corporation and the Utility tr
ack and report their annual environmental performance results across a broad spectrum of areas.  The Utility reports its GHGemissions to the CARB and the EPA 
on a mandatory basis. On a voluntary b asis, the Utility reports a more comprehensive emissions inventory to The ClimateRegistry, a non-pro 
fit organization.  The Uti lity’s third-party verified voluntary GHG inventory reported to The Climate Registry for 2 01 6, the most recent dataavailable, 
totaled more than 50 milli on metric tonnes of CO ­ 2 equivalent , three-quarters of which came from customer natural gas use.  The following t able showsthe 201

 Water
Quality
 
In 
2014, the EPA issued final regulations to implement the requirements of the federal Clean Water Act that require cooling water intake structures at electricpower plants, such as the nuclea
r generation facilities at Diablo Canyon, to reflect the best tech nology available to mini mize adverse environmental impacts. Various industry and environment
al groups have challenged the federal regulations in proceedings pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. California’s once-through 
cooling po licy discussed below is consider ed to be at least as stringent as the new federal regulations.  Therefore, California’simplementation proc
ess for the state policy will likely continue without any significant change. 
At the state level, in 2010 
, the Calif ornia Water Board adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or othersignificant measures to red
uce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%.   The policy also provided for analternative compliance approach f
or nuclear plants if certain criteria were met.  As required by the policy , the California Water Board appointed a committee toevaluate the feasib
ility and cost of using alternative techno logies to achieve compl iance at Diablo Canyon.  The committee’s consultant submitted its final reportto the California Wat
er Board in September 2014 .  The report addressed feasibility, costs and timeframe s to install alternative technologies at Diablo Can yon, such as cooling towers.
 
On June 20, 2016, the Utility entered in
to a joint proposal with certain parties to retire Diablo Canyon ’s two nuclear power reacto r units at the expiration of their current operating li
censes in 2024 and 2025 .   As a result o f the planned retire ment, the California Water Board will no longer need to address alternativecompliance measures 
for Diablo Canyon.  A s required under the p olicy, the Utility paid an annual interim mitigation fee beginning in 2017, which it will continu e to pay 
until operations cease in 2025 .   
Additionally, t 
he Utility expects that its decision to retire Diablo Canyon will affect the terms of a final settlement agreement between the Utility, the Cent ralCoast Board and the California Atto
rney General’s Office regarding the therma l component of the plant’s once-through cooling discharge.  (For more information,see “Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant” 
in Item 3. Legal Proceedings below.) 
Nuclear
Fuel
Disposal
 
Under the Nuclear Waste Poli
cy Act of 1982, the DOE and electric util ities with commercial nuclear power plants were authorized to enter into contracts underwhich the DOE would be required to dispose of th
e utilities’ spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by January 1998, in exchange for fees paid by the utilities’ custome
rs.  The DOE has been unable to meet its contractual obligation with the Utility to dispose of nuclear waste from the Utility’s two nucleargenerating units at Diablo Canyon 
and the retired nuclear facility at Humbol dt Bay.  As a result, the Utility cons tructed interim dry cask storage facilities to storeits spent fuel onsite at Di
ablo Canyon and at Humboldt Bay until the DOE fulfills its contractual obligation to take possession of the spent fuel.  The Utility and other nuclear power plant owne
rs sued the DOE to recover the costs that they incurred to construct interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. 
In September 2012, the 
U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Utility executed a settlement agreement that awarded the Utility $266 million for spent fuelstorage costs incurred th
rough December 31, 2010.  The settlement agre ement also provided a claims process by which the Utility submits annual requ ests for reimbursement of its ongo
ing spent fuel storage costs.   Through 2017, the Utility has been awarded an additional $114 million through these annual submissions , including 
$15 million for costs incur red between June 1, 2015 and May 31, 2016.   The cl aim for the period June 1, 2016 th rough May 31, 2017, totaledapproximately $29 mill
ion and is currently under review by the DOE.   These proceeds are being refunded to customers through rates.   A new settlementagreement, for costs th
rough 2019 was execute d in March 2017.  Considerable uncer tainty continues to exist regarding when and whether the DOE will meet itscontractual obligat
ion to the Utility and other nuclear power plant owners to dispose of spent fuel.

RISK
FACTORS
PG&E Corporation’s an 
d the Utility’s financi al results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accountingpolicies described in M
D&A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial re sults.  Thefollowing discussion of key risk fa

and stock price.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resultingfrom the impact of the multip 
le wildfires that spre ad through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Del Norte, Lake,Nevada, and Yuba Counties, as well as in the 
area surrounding Yuba City, beginning on October 8, 2017 (the “Northern California wildf ires”).  According to the Cal Fire California Statewid
e Fire Summary dated October   30, 2017, at the peak of the wildfires, there were 21 major wildfires in California that, in total, burnedover 245,000 acres, resulted in 43 
fatalities, and destroyed an es timated 8,900 structures.  Subsequ ently, the number of fatalities increased to 44. 
The Utility incurred $219 mi
llion in costs for service restoration and repair to the Utility’s facilities (including $97 million in capital expenditures) throughDecember 3 
1, 2017 in connection with these fi res.  While the Utility believes that such costs are recoverable through CEMA, its CEMA requests are subject toCPUC approval.  The Utility’s financia
l condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is  unable to recoversuch costs.
 
The fires are being inves
tigated by Cal Fire and the CPUC, including the possible role of the Utility’s power lines and other facilities.  The Utility expects that CalFire will issue a 
report or reports stat ing its conclusions as to the sources of ignition of the fires and the ways that they progressed.  The CPUC’s SED also isconducting investigations to 
assess the compliance of electric and communication companies’ facilities with appl icable rules and regulation s in fire impactedareas.  According to inform
ation made available by the CPUC, investigation topics include, but are not limited to, maintenance of facilities, vegetationmanagement, and emerg
ency preparedness and response.  Var ious other entities, inc luding fire departments, may also be investigating certain of the fires.  (Forexample, on February 3, 2018, it was repo
rted that investigators with the Santa Rosa Fire Department had completed their investigation of two small fires that reportedly destroyed two homes 
and damaged one outbuilding and had concluded that the Utility’s facilities, along with h igh wind and other factors, contributed tothose fires.)  It is unce
rtain when the investigations will be complete and whether Cal Fire will release any pr eliminary findings before its investigation iscomplete. 
 
As of January 31, 2018, the Utility had submi
tted 22 electric incident reports to the CPUC associated with the Northern California wildfires where Cal Fire hasidentified 
a site as potentially involving the Utility’s facilities in its investigation and the property damage associated with each incident exceeded $50,000.  Theinformation contained in t
hese reports is factual and preliminary, and does not reflect a determinati on of the causes of the fir es.  The investigations into the firesare ongoing.
 
If the Utility’s fac
ilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be the cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of inversecondemna 
tion applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substant
ial and have a material adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility .  (See “The doctrine of inve rse condemnation, if appliedby courts in litigation to whi
ch PG&E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materiallynegatively affect PG&E Corpor
at ion’s and the Utility’s fin ancial condition, results of operations, and cash flows” below.)  In addition to such claims for propertydamage, interest and a
ttorneys’ fees, the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expe nses, personal injury damages, and otherdamages under other theor
ies of liability, including if the Utility were found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and havea material advers
e effect on PG&E Corporation a nd the Utility.  Further, the Uti lity could be subject to material fines or penalties if the CPUC or any other lawenforcement agency brough
t an enforcement action and determined that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. 
27
 

  
Give 
n the preliminary stag es of investigations and the uncertainty as to the causes of the fires, PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe a loss is probableat this time.  However, it is 
reasonably possible that facts could emerge through the course of the various investigations that lead PG&E Corporation and the Utilityto believe that a loss is p
robable, resulting in an accrued liability in the future, the amount of which could be material.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility currentlyare unable to re 
asonably estimate the amount of losses (or range of amounts) that they could incur, given the preliminary stages of the investigations and theuncertainty regarding 
the extent and magnitude of potential damages.  On January 31, 2018, the California Departm ent of Insurance issued a pr ess releaseannouncing an update on property loss
es in connection with the October and December wildfires in California, stating that, as of such date, “insurers have receivednearly 45,000 insurance cla
ims totaling more than $1 1.79 billion in losses,” of which approx imately $10 billion relates to statewide claims from the October 2017wildfires.  The remaining 
amount relates to claims from the Southern California December 2017 wildfires.  According to the California Department o f Insurance, as of the date of the press 
release, more than 21,000 homes, 3,200 businesses, and more than 6,100 vehicles, watercraft, farm vehicles, and other equipment weredamaged or destroyed by the Octob
er 2017 wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Util ity have not independently ve rified these estimates.  The CaliforniaDepartment of Insurance d
id not state in its press release whether it intends to provide updated estimates of losses in the future. 
If the Utility’s facilities are determi
ned to be the c ause of one or more of the North ern California wildfires, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be liable forthe related property 
losses and other damages.  The California Department of Insurance January 31, 2018 press release reflects insured property l osses only.  The press release does not ac
count for uninsured losses, interest, attorneys’ fees, fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury andwrongful death damages or othe
r costs.  If the Utility were to be found liable f or certain or all of su ch other costs and expenses, the amount of PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s liability could be higher than the approximately $10 billion estimated in respect of the wildfires that occurred in October 2017,depending on the extent 
of the damage in connect ion with such fire or fires.  As a result, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows could be materially affected. 
PG&E Corporation and t 
he Utility also are the subj ect of a still incr easing number of lawsuits that have been filed against PG&E Corporation and the Utility inSonoma, Napa and San Francisco Counties’ Superio
r Courts, several of which seek to be certified as class actions.  The lawsuits allege, among other things, negligence, inverse conde
mnation, trespass, and private nuisance.  They principally assert that PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s alleged failure to maintainand repair their dist
ribution and transmission lines and failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the fires.  Theplaintiffs seek damag
es that include wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, evacuation costs, medical expenses, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, andother damages.  In ad 
dition, two derivative lawsui ts for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment were filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court onNovember 16, 2017 and November 20, 2017, respect
ively. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to be the subject o f additional lawsuits in conn ection with theNorthern California wildfi
res.  The wildfire litigation could take a number of years to be resolved because of the complexity of the matters, including the ongoinginvestigation into the c
auses of the fires and the growing number of parties and claims involved.  The Utility has liability insurance from various insurers, whichprovides coverage for thi
rd-party liability attributable to the Northern California wildfires in an aggregate amount of approximately $800 million.  If the Utility were to be found liable for on
e or more fires, the Utility’s insurance could be insufficient to cover that liability, depending on the extent of the damage inconnection with such fire or 
fires. 
In addition, it could take 
a number of years before the Util ity’s final liability is known and the Utility could apply for cost recovery.  The Utility may be unable torecover costs in excess of 
insurance through regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take a number of years to resolve and a numberof years thereafte
r to collect.  Further, SB 819, introduced in the California Senate in January 2018, if it becomes law, would prohibit utilities from recovering costsin excess of insurance resu
lting from damages c aused by such utilities’ f acilities, if the CPUC determines that the utility did not reasonably construct, maintain,manage, control, or opera
te the facilities.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have considered certain actions that might be taken to attemp t to address liquidity needs of the business in such cir
cumstances, but the inability to recover costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collecting such rates in atimely manner, or any neg
ative assessment by the Utility of the likel ihood or timeliness of such r ecovery and collection, could have a material adverse effect onPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.  (See “If the Utility is unable to recover all or a significant portion of its 
excess costs in connection with the Northern California wildfires and the Butte fire through ratemaking mechanisms, PG&E Corporation’s andthe Utility’s financi
al condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be m aterially affected” below.)  
Losses in connection with the wildf
ires would likely require PG&E Corporation and the Utility to seek financing, which may not be available on terms acceptableto PG&E Corporation or the Utility, or 
at all, when required.  (See “Risks Related to Liquidity and Capi tal Requirements” below.) 
28
 

  
As of December 31, 2017, neither PG&E Corporat
ion nor the Utility has accrued a liability with respect to the Northern California wildfires. If PG&E Corporationand the Utility were to det
ermi ne that it is both probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, a liability would be recordedconsistent with applicabl
e accounting principles and as described in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial S tatements in Item 8.  As not ed above, tothe extent that such det
ermination is made and a liability is accrued with respect to the Northern California wildfires, the amount of such liability accrual may besubstantial. To the extent no
t offset by insurance recoveries determined to be similarly probable and estimable, the liability would reduce the balance sheet equityof PG&E Corporation and the Utility, which 
could adversely impact the Utility’s ability to maintain its CPUC-authorized capital structure of 5 2% equity and 48% debt and preferred stock, 
and which could also adversely impact PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings and their ability to declare and pay dividends,efficiently raise capital, comply 
with financial covenants, and meet finan cial obligations.  (See “PG&E Corpor ation’s and the Utility’s financial results will beaffected by their ab
ility to continue accessing the capital markets and by the terms of debt and equity financings” below.) 
Uncertainties relating to an
d market percept ion of these matters and the disclosure of findings regarding these matters over time, also could continue or increase volatility in the ma
rket for PG&E Corporation’s common stock and other securities, and for the securities of the Utility, and materially affect the price of such securities.

fire.  
In September 2015, a wildfire 
(known as the “Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.   On April 28, 2016, Cal Fire 
  released its report of the investigation of the origin and cause of the wildfire.  According to Cal Fire’s report, the fire burned 70,868 acres, resulted in twofatalities, destroyed 
549 homes, 368 outbuildings and four comm er cial properties, and da maged 44 structures.  Cal Fire’s   report concluded that the wildfire wascaused when a gray pine tree 
contacted   the Utility’s   electric line which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by the Utility   and/or itsvegetation managemen
t contractors, ACRT Inc. and Trees, Inc.,   to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management program ultimately led tothe failure of the tree.
 
In connection with the Butte f
ire, complaints have been filed against t he Utility, currently invo lving approximately 3,770 individual plaintiffs representingapproximately 2,030 households and th
eir insurance companies.  Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on the doctrine of inversecondemnati 
on and negligence theory of l iability.  Plaintiffs also seek punitive damages.  The number of individual complaints and plaintiffs may still increase inthe future 
, because the statute of limitations for property damages in connection with the Butte fire h as not yet expired.   (The statute of limitations for personalinjury in connection with the But
te fire has expired.)   The Utility continues medi ating and settling cases. 
In addition, on April 13, 2017, Cal Fire fi
led a complaint seeking to recover $87 milli on for its costs incurred in connection with the Butte fire , and in May 2017, the OES indicated that it in
tends to bring a claim against the Utility that the OES estima ted in the approximate amoun t of $190 million.  Also, in June 2017, the County of Calave 
ras indicated that it intend s to bring a claim against the Utility that it estimates in the approximate amount of $85 million.  
In connection with th 
is matter, the Utili ty may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, through thedoctrine of inverse conde
mnation.  In addition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility werefound to have been negligent.  Wh
ile the Utility believes it was not negligent, there can be no assurance that a court or jury would agree with the Utility.  
The Utility currently be
lieves that it is probabl e that it will incur a loss of at least $1.1 billion , increased from the $750 m illion previously estimated as ofDecember 31, 2016 
in connection with the Butte f ire.  W hile this amount includes the Utility’s assumptions about fire suppression costs (includ ing its assessment of the Cal Fire loss), it does not 
include any significant portion of the estimated claims from the OES and the County of Calaveras.  The Utility still does not havesufficient informa
tion to reasonably estimate the probable loss it may have for these additiona l claims.   A change in management’s estimates or assumptions couldresult in an adjustment 
that could have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, r esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

Through December 31, 2017, the amounts a
ccrued in connection with claims relating to the Butte fire have exceeded the Utility’s liabil ity insurance coverage. While the Utility fi
led an application with the CPUC requesting approval to establish a WEMA to track wildfire expenses and to preserve the opportunity for theUtility to request recov
ery of wildfire costs that have not otherwise been recov ered through insurance or other mechanisms, the Utility cannot predict the outcomeof this proceeding.  (See “ 
Regulatory Matters – Application   to Establish a Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account” in Item 7. MD&A.)  
29
 

 In addition, 
there can be no assurance that the Utility will be allowed to recover costs recorded in WEMA, if approved, in the future. While the CPUC previously approved WEMA tracking accounts 
for San Diego Gas & Electric Company in 2010, in December 2017, the CPUC den ied recovery of costs tha t San Diego Gas& Electric Company stat
ed it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are notrelevant to the CPUC’s prudent manag
er standard .  That determination is b eing challenged by San Diego Gas & Electric as well as by the Utility and SouthernCalifornia Edison. 
 
Additionally, SB 819 introduced in the Cal
ifornia Senate in January 2018, i f it becomes law, would prohibit u tilities’ recover y of costs in excess of insurance resulting from damages 
caused by such utilities’ facilities, if the CPUC determines that the U tility did not reasonably construct, maintain, manage, control, oroperate the facilities.
 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility hav 
e considered certain actions that might be taken to attempt to address liquidity needs of the business in such circumstances,but the inability to re
cover all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collec ting such rates in a tim ely manner, orany negative assessment by th
e Utility of the likelihood or timeliness of such recovery and collection, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

California law includes a do
ctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California for wildfire damages. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liability f
or attorneys’ fees) for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities’ electric transmission lines.  
Courts have imposed liabili ty under the doctrine of inv erse condemnation in leg al actions brought by property holders against utilities on thegrounds that losses borne by the person whose p
roperty was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefitted fromsuch unde 
rtaking , and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers.  Plaintiffs have assert ed the doctrine ofinverse condemnation in l
awsuits related to the Northern California and Butte fires, and it is possib le that plaintiffs could be successful in convincing courts toapply this doctrine in thes
e or other litigations. For example, o n June 22, 2017, the Superior Court for the County of Sa cramento found that the doctrine of inverse condemnation 
applies to the Utility with respect to th e Butte fire.  Although the Utility has filed a renewed motion for a legal determ ination of inversecondemnation liability 
, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in its arguments that the doctrine of invers e condemnation does not apply in the Butte fire or other 
litigation against PG&E Corporation or the Utility. 
Furthermore, a court could d
etermine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies even in the absence of an open CPUC proceeding for cost recovery, or before a potential cos
t recovery decision is issued by the CPUC.  Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability toautomatically recover these cost
s from their customers, there can be no guar antee that the CPUC would authorize cos t recovery whether or not a previous courtdecision imposes liabil
ity on a utility under the doctrine of inverse condemnation.  I n December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas &Electric Company 
stated it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are notrelevant to the CPUC’s prudent manag
er standard. That determination is being challenged by San Diego Gas & Electric as well as by th e Utility and SouthernCalifornia Edison.
 
I 
f PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for damage under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, but is unable to secure a cost recoverydecision from the CPUC to pay for 
such costs through increases in rat es , the financial condition, r esults of operations, liquidity and cash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Utility would be 
materially affected by potential losses result ing from the impact of the Northern California wildf ires.  (See “ PG&E Corporation and the Utility a
lso expect to be the subject of additional lawsuits and could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcementactions” and “PG&E Corporation’s and 
the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liqu idity and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimateamount of third-party l
iability that the Utility incurs in connection with the Butte fire” above.)

The Utility is subje 
ct to extensive regula tions, including federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcementproceedings in connection with su
ch regulations.  The Utility could incur ma terial charges, including fines an d other penalties, in conne ction with the ex parte OII,safety culture OII, and th
e CPUC’s SED investigations, including the SED’s investigations of the Yuba City incident, which arose from a residential structure firein Yuba City, California, in January 
2017, that resulted in the co llapse of a house and injuries to two persons inside the house, or other current and future investigations. 
  The SED could launch investigations a t any time on any issue it deems appropriate.
The SED has discretion whether to 
issue a penalty for each v iolation, but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutorypenalty of $50,000, with an administ
rative limit of $8 million per citation issued.  The SED may, at its discretion, impose pen alties on a daily basis, or on less thana daily basis, for violat
ions that continued for more than one day.  The SED also has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on the totality ofthe circumstances, in
cluding such factors as the gr avity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the number of persons affected; and thegood faith of the entity ch
arged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation.  The SED also is required to consider th e appropriateness of the amount of the penalty 
to the size of the entity charged.  Historically, the SED has exercised broad discretion in determining whether violations are continuingand the amount of penalti
es to be imposed.   While it is uncerta in how th e CPUC will calculate the number o f violations or the penalty for any violations, suchfines or penalties could b
e significant and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liquidity and results of operations.  (See Note 13 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Item 8.)  
The Utility also is a targ
et of a number of investigations.  In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General's officeopened investigations
 into matters related to allegedly improper communicat ion between the Utility and CPUC personnel.  The Utility also is unable to predict theoutcome of, or costs and expenses 
associate with, pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility. 
If these 
investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalt ies and, in the event of a judg ment against the Utility, suffer fur
ther ongoing negative consequences.  For example, on April 9, 2015, the CP UC issued a decision in its investig ative enforcement proceedingsagainst the Utility to i
mpose total penalties of $1.6 billion on the Utility after determining that the Utility had committed numerous violations of laws andregulations related 
to its natur al gas transmission opera tions (the “San Bruno Penalty Decision”).  The San Bruno Penalty Decision requires the SED to review theUtility’s gas transmission op
erations (including the Utility’s compliance with the remedies ordered by the San Bruno Penalty De cision) and to perform annu alaudits of the Utility’s r
ecord-keeping practices for a minimum of ten years.  The SED could impose fines on the Utility or require the Utility to incur unrecoverablecosts, or both, based on the outcome o
f these future audits.   Furthermore, a negative ou tcome in any of these investigations, or future enforcement actions, couldnegatively affect 
the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; for example, by enabling parties to ch allenge the Utility’s request to 
recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility’s violations.  (See also “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s futurefinancial results could be
 materially affected by the conviction of the Utility i n the federal crim inal proceeding and by the debarment proceeding” below.) 
The Utility could be subject 
to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws,regulations or 
orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacyrequirements; customer billing;
 customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construct ion, operating and mai ntenance practices; safetyand inspection practic
es; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; andenvironmental compli
ance.  For example, despite th e Utility’s system-wide surv ey of its transmission pipelines, carried out in an effort to address a self-reportedviolation whereby the Utili
ty did not properly identify encroachments (such as building structures and vegetation overgrowth) on the Utility’s pipeline rights-of- way, the SED could impose fines on the Util
ity in the future based on the Utility’s failure to continuously survey its system and remove encroachments. CPUCstaff could also impose pen
alties on the Utility in the future in accordance wi th its authority under the g as and electric safety citation programs.  The amount ofsuch fines, penalties, or cus
tomer refunds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,and 
cash flows.

On August 9, 2016, the jury in the 
federal criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in SanFrancisco, found the Utility gui
lty on one count of obstructing a federal agency proceedin g and five counts of violations o f pipeline integrity managementregulations of the Natura
l Gas Pipeline Safety Act.  On January 26, 2017, the court issued a judgment of conviction against the Utility.  The court sentenced theUtility to a 
five- year corpor ate probation period, overs ight by a third-party monitor for a period of five year s, with the ability to apply for early termination afterthree years 
, a fine of $3 million to be p aid to the federal government, certain advertising requirements, and communi ty service.  
The 
probation includes a requirement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period.  As part of the probation, the Utilityhas retained a third-p
arty monitor at the Utility’s expense.  The goal of the monitor is to help ensur e that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriate steps tomaintain the safety o
f its gas and electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive programs on a Utility-wide basis. 
The Utility could incur ma
terial costs and additional penalties , not recoverable through r ates, in the event of non-compliance with the terms of its probation and inconnection with the monitorsh
ip (including but not limited to costs resulting from recomme ndations of the monitor).  
Since 2015, the Utility has also be
en the subject of a DOI inquiry into whether the Util ity should be suspended or debarred from entering into federal procurementand non-procurement contr
acts and programs , citing the San Bruno e xplosion , and indicating, as the basis for the inquiry, alleged poor record-keeping, pooridentification and ev
aluation of threats to gas lines and obstruction of the NTSB’s investigation.  On December 21, 2016, the Utility and the DOI entered into aninter 
im administrative agreement that reflects  the DOI’s determination that the Utility remains eligible to contract with federal government agencies while the DOIdetermines whether any fu
rther action is necessary to protect the federal government’s business i nterests.  If the DOI deter mines that the Utility’s compliance andethics program is not 
generally effective in preventing and detecting criminal conduct, the Utility may be required to enter into an amended administrativeagreement and implement remedial a 
nd other measures, such as a r equirement that the Utility’s natural gas operations and/or compliance and eth ics programs be supervised by one or more independ
ent third- party monitor (s) . 
The Utility’s conviction and 
the outcome of probation and the debarme nt proceeding could harm th e Utility’s relationships with regulators, legislators,communities, business partn
ers, or other constituencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management.   Further, they couldnegatively affe 
ct the outcome of futur e ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, for example, by enabling parties to argue that the Utility should not be allowed torecover costs that the p
arties allege are somehow related to the criminal charges on which the Utility was f ound guilty.  They could also result in increasedregulatory or legisla
tive scrutiny with respect to various aspects of how the Utility’s business is conducted or organized.  (See “Enforcement and Li tigation Matters” 
in Item 7. MD&A.)  
PG&E
Corporation’s
and
the
Utility’s
financial
results
pri marily
depend
on
the
outcomes
of

regulatory
and
ratemaking
proceedings
and
the
Utility’s
ability
tomanage
its

expenses
and
capital
expendi
tures
so
that
it
is
able
to
earn
its
authorized
rate
of
return
in
a
timely
manner.  
As a regulated entity, the Ut
ility’s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficientrevenues to recover 
reasonable costs of providing service, in cluding a return on its capital investments.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial resultscould be materially 
affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn itsauthorized ROE.  The outcome of the Ut
ility’s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by interv ening parties;potential rate impacts; increasing
 levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regula tory, or legislative env ironments; and the opinions of the Utility’sregulators, consumer and oth
er stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility’s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gasservices. 
  Further, the inc reasing amount of Reliability Must Run ( “ RMR ” ) electric generation in the CAISO could increase the Utility’s costs of procuringcapacity needed for reliable ser
vice to its customers .  
32
 
 
In addition to the amount of 
authorized revenues, PG&E Corporation’s an d the Utility’s financial re sults could be materially affected if the Utility’s actual costs tosafely and reliably se
rve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs.  The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing ma rket circumstances, unanti
cipated events (such as storms, fires, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility’s operations), or compliance with newstate laws or policies.  Although 
the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of t he additional costs, ther e may be a substantial time lag between when theUtility incurs the costs and when 
the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs.  Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may disallow costs thatthey determine wer 
e not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility. 
The Utility 
also   is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of astate-wide electr
ic vehicle charging infrastructure, the d eployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energyefficiency programs, 
energy storage and renewable energy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the Ca lifornia high-sp eed rail project.  The Utility’s ability to r
ecover costs, including its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will, in large part, depend on thefinal form of legisl
ative or regulatory requirements, and whethe r the associated ratemaking mec hanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect a lower customer demand for the Utility’s electricity an
d natural gas services .

t
o
recover
“pass-through”
costs,
including
electri city
andnatural
gas
procurement
costs,
from
customers

in
a
ti
mely
manner.

The
CPUC
may
disallow
procurement
costs
for
a
variety
of
reasons.

In
addition,
theUtility’s
ability
to
r
ecover
these
costs
could
be
affected
by
the
loss
of
Uti lity
customers
and
decreased
new
customer
growth
,
 if
the
CPUC
fails
to
adjust
theUtility’s
rates
to
refl
ect
such
events.
 The Utility meets customer
 demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity gen erated from the Utility’s o wn generation facilities, electricityprovided by third parties unde
r power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market.   The Utility must manage these sources using thecommercial and CPUC regulatory p 
rinciples of “least cost dispatch” and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procur
ement plan.  The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the U tility did not comply with these principl
es or if the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan.  
Further, the contractual 
prices for electricity under the Utility’s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety of reasons, including developm
ents in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lowercustomer demand due to adve
rse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility’s cus tomers to other reta il providers.   In particular, the Utility will incur additionalcosts to procure renewable 
energy to meet the higher targets established by California SB 350 that became effective on January 1, 2016.  Despite the CPUC’scurrent approval 
of the contracts, the CPUC could disal low contract costs in the future if it determines that the terms of such contracts, including price, do not meetthe CPUC reasonableness standard. 
 
The Utility’s ability to 
recover the costs it incurs in the wholesa le electricity market may be affected b y whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continuesto function effectively.  
Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and software on which the market 
mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices.   The CPUC could prohibit the Utilityfrom passing through the higher 
costs of electricity to customers.  For example, during the 2000 and 2001 energy crisis, the mark et mechanism flaws inCalifornia’s then-newly
 established wholesale electricity market led to dramatically high market prices for electricity that the Utility was unable to recover throughcustomer rates, ulti
mately causing the Utility to file a pet ition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
Further, PG&E Corporation’s and the Util
ity’s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs throughmunicipalization of 
the Utility’s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number ofconsumers who become direct 
access customers of alternative generation providers.  (See “Competitio n in the Electricity Industry” in Item 1.)  As the number ofbundled customers (i.e., those 
customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increaseas the Utility would have a 
smaller customer bas e from which to recover certain procurement costs.  Although the Utility is permi tted to collect non-bypassablecharges for 
above market generation-related costs incurre d on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover thesecosts.  In addition, the Utili
ty’s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups.  Furthermore, ifthe former customers return t
o receiving electrici ty supply from the Utility, th e Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able totimely recover through rates
 or that it may not be able to recover at all. 
33 
 

In addition, increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by custo mers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customers to 
receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers.  New rules and rates became effective for new NEM custom
ers of the Utility in December 2016.  New NEM customers are required to pay an interconnection fee, comply with time of userates, and are requir
ed to pay certain non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the cos ts of low income, energy eff iciency, and other programs that othercustomers pay.  Remaining custo
mers may incur significantly higher bills due to an increase in customers seeking alternative energy providers .   The CPUC hasindicated that it in
tends to revi sit these rules in 2019.  
A confluence of technology-r
elated cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage aviable, cost-effective alternative to
 the Utility’s bundled electric service which could furthe r threaten the Utility ’s ability to recover its generation, transmission,and distribution investmen
ts.  If the number of the Utility’s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility’s level of author ized capital investment 
could decline as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings.  Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due tocustomer migration to o
ther energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technolog y, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substanti
ally offset through regulatory cost allocations, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business, financial condition, results of opera
t ions, liquidity, and cash flows.  
The CPUC has begun to implement rate r
eform to allow residential electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities’ actual costs of providing service and decreasecross 
-subsidization among custom er classes.  Many aspe cts of rate reform are not yet  finalized, including time-of-use rates and whether the utilities can impose afixed charge on certa
in customers.  
Further, c 
hanges in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility’s ability to timely recov er its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE.  Although the Utility general
ly recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as “pass-through” costs, a significant and sustained rise incommodity prices could c
reate overall rate pressures that make it m ore difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as “pass-through” costs.  To relieve some of this upward 
rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery.  
If the Utility is unable 
to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of changingloads, the wide deployment of dis
tributed generation, and the d evelopment of new elect ricity generation and energy storage technologies, PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s 
financial condition, r esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected .

PG&E Corporation’s 
and the Utility’s liquidity is dependent on many factors, including a ccess to the capital markets a nd availability under their revolving creditfacilities and commercial paper pro
gram s .  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access the capital markets, t he ability t o borrow under their loan financing arrangements, 
including their revolving credit facilities, and the terms and rates of future financings, as well as the credit ratings of PG&E Corporation and the 
Utility and their respective debt facilitie s, could be materially affected by the outcome or market percep tion of the matters dis cussed in this 2017 Form 10- K 
under “Northern California Wi ldfires” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Fin ancial Statements in Item 8 .  Liabilities that cou ld be incurred as a resultof the Northern California wi
ldfires could adversely affect th eir ability to comply with the covenants in their financing arrangements, which could adversely affectthe ability to borrow under th
e applicable facility or program.  
Access by 
PG&E Corporation to the equity capital markets is also critical to maintaining the Utility’s CPUC-authorized capital struc ture. PG&E Corporation contributes equity to t 
he Utility as needed to maintain the Utility’s CPUC-author ized capital structure.   In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, PG&ECorporation 
issued $ 416 million in common stock and made equity contributions of $ 455 million to the Utility .   PG&E Corporatio n forecasts it will need amaterial am 
ount of equity in future yea rs, including to support the Utility’s capital expenditures.   PG&E Corporation may also seek to issue addit ional equity tofund unrecoverable opera
ting expenses and to pay claims, losses, fin es and penalties that m ay be   required by the outcome of enforcement matters and litigation,including in connection with th
e Northern California wildfires, and the outcome of the related CPUC and Cal Fire investigations. 
If 
either PG&E Corporation or the Utility is unable to access the c apital markets or to borrow under their respective loan financing arrangements or commercialpaper program

be
ad

affected.  
PG&E Corporation 
is a holding company with no revenue g enerating operations of its own.   The Utility must use its resources to sa tisfy its own obligations,including the 
Utility’s obligation to serve custom ers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends , unless suspended, and meet its obligations to 
employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&E Corporation . Under the CPUC’s rules applicable to ut ility holdingcompanies, the 
Utility’s dividend policy must be estab lished by the Utility’s Board of Directors as though the Utility were a stand-alone util ity company andPG&E Corporation’s 
Board of Directors must give “first priority” to the Utility’s capital requirements, as determine d to be necessary and prudent to meet theUtility’s 
obligation to serve or to ope rate the Utility in a prudent and effici ent manner.  The CPUC has interpreted this “first priority” obl igation to include the requirement that 
PG&E Corp oration “infuse the Utility with all types of capita l necessary for the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve . ”  In addition, before theUtility 
can pay common stock dividends to PG&E Corp oration , the U tility must maintain its autho rized capital structure with an average 52% equity component. 
If the 
Utility were required to pay a ma terial amount of fines or incur material unrecoverable costs in connection with the Northern California wildfires , the Butt e fire 
, the pending CPUC investigations, the terms of probation or monitorship, or other liabilities or enforcement matters, it would require incremental equitycontributions from 
PG&E Corporation to restore its capit al structure.  PG&E Corp oration common s tock issuances used to fund such equi ty contributions couldmaterially dilut
e earnings per share. (See “Liquidity and Financ ial Resources” in Item 7. MD&A ).  Further, if PG&E Corp oration were required to infuse the Utility 
with significant capit al or if the Utility w ere unable to distribute cash to PG&E Corporation , or both, PG&E Corporation may be unable to pay princip aland interest on its outstand
ing debt, pay its common stock dividend or meet other obligations. 
In December 2017, the Boards of Dire
ctors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspend ed dividends on common stock of PG&E Corporation and preferred stockof the Utility due to uncer
tainty related to the causes and potential liabilities associated with the Northern California wildfires.  The suspens ion of dividends could continue to 
materially affect the price of PG&E Corporation’s common stock and adversely affect the ability of PG&E Corporation to raise additional equitycapital.  There can be no 
assurances as to when, if at all, the Board of Direct ors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility wi ll determine to re-instate quarterly cashdividends on PG&E Corporation’s common stock o
r the Utility’s preferred stock. 
PG&E

their
ability
to
continue

PG&E Corporation and the Utility will 
continue to seek funds in the capital and credit markets to enable the Utility to make capital investments, and to pay finesthat 
may be imposed in the future, as well as costs related to rights-of-way and legal and regulatory costs.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to accessthe capital and cred
it markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend primarily o n PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings and outlook. Their credit ratings 
and outlook can be affected by many factors, including pending or anticipated litigation, the pending Cal Fire and CPUC investigations andCPUC ratemaking proceedings, 
and by the December 20, 2017 decision o f the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to suspend dividends, aswell as the perceived i
mpact of all such matters on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, whether or not such perception is accura te.  OnDecember 21, 2017, Moody's Investor Servic
es and on December 22, 2017, S tandard & P oor’s Global Ratings, each placed all of th e ratings of PG&ECorporation and the Utility unde
r review for downgrade , and Standard & Poor’s Globa l Ratings additionally lower ed its ratings on the Utility’s preferred stock . If PG&E Corporation’s or the Utili
ty’s credit ratings were to be downgraded or th e ratings on the Utility’s preferred stock are further downgraded, in particular to below investm 
ent grade, their abil ity to access the capital and credit markets would be negatively affected and could result in higher borrowing costs, fewerfinancing options, including r
educed, or lack of, access to the commercial paper market and additional collater al posting requirements, whi ch in turn could affectliquidity and lead to an in
creased financing need.  Other factors can affect the availability and terms of debt and equity financing, including changes in the federalor state regulatory env
ironment affec ting energy companies gene rally or PG&E Corporation and the Utility in particular, the overall health of the energy industry,an increase in inter
est rates by the Federal Reserve Bank, and general economic and financial market conditions. 
The reputations 
of PG&E Corporation and the Utility con tinue to suffer from the negative publicity about matters discussed under “Enforcement and LitigationMatters” in 
Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Not e 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 .  The negative publicity and the uncertaintyabout the outcomes of
 these matters may undermine confidence in management’s ability to execute its business strategy and restore a constructive regulatoryenvironment, which could advers
ely impact PG&E Corporati on’s stock price.  Further, the market price of PG&E Corporation common stock could declinematerially 
depending on the outcome of thes e matters.   The amount and timing of futu re share issuances also could affect the stock price.

The Utility owns and operates ext
ensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system 
.  (See “Electric Util ity Operations” and “Nat ural Gas Utility Operations” in Item 1. Business.)  The Utility’s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends onits ability to efficiently maintain
, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment
 projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities.  In addition, the Utility is obligated todecommission its electricity ge
neration facilities at the end of their useful operating lives , and the CPUC approved retirement of Di ablo Canyon by 2024 and 2025.  The Utility’s ability to s
afely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility’s control, inc
luding those that arise from:  
the breakdown or failure of 
equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can causeexplosions, fires, or other c
atastrophic eve nts;  
an overpressure event 
occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow correct operatingprocedures, or welding or fabr
ication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or d istribution assets anduncontained natural gas f
low; 
the 
failure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gasoutages, gas surges back into homes, s
erious personal injury or loss of life; 
a prolonged statewide ele
ctric al black-out that resu lts  in damage to the Utility’s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other thirdparties;
 
the failure to fully 
identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for emplo yees or the public, environm entaldamage, or reputationa
l damage; 
the release of radioactive materials ca
used by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act; 
the failure of a large dam or
 other major hydroelectric facility, o r the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility’s assets are built; 
the failure to take expeditio
us or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonablyshould have identified, as unsa
fe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas exp losion) ;  
inadequate emergency p
reparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee har m orextended outages;
 
operator or other human e
rror; 
an ineffective records management
 program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintaina utility system safe
ly and prudently; 
construction performed by 
thir d parties that damage s the Utility’s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or“dig-ins” that damage 
the Utility’s underground pipelines; 
the release of haza
rdous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, in cluding, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking lead-based paint from the 
Utility’s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and 
attacks by third parti
es, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, o r war.   
36
 


 The occurrence of any 
of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generatingoutput; damage the Utili
ty’s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of thi rd parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customersor others; and cause persona
l injury or death.  As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore se rvice, and to compensate third parties.  
 
Further, although the Utility o
ften enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or theconstruction or demolit
ion or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor’s work and can be subject to penalties orother enforcement a
ction if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.  The Utility may a lso be subject to liability, penalties or otherenforcement action 
as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions.  
Insurance, equipment 
warranties, or other contractual indemnification requi rements may not be suffi cient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery underall circumstances o
r against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject.  An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s 
and the Utility’s financ ial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

The Utility 
has experienced incre ased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the Utility’s ordinary operations. PG&E Corporation, the Utilit 
y or its contractors and customers may experience cover age reductions and/or increased wildfire insurance costs in future years.  Noassurance can be given tha
t future losses will not exceed the limits of the Utility’s insurance coverage.  Uninsured losses a nd increases in the cost of insurancemay not be recoverable 
in customer rates.  A loss which is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, r esults of operatio ns, liquidity, and cash flows .  
As a result of the 
potential application of a strict liability standard under the doctrine of inve rse condemnation , recent losses recorded by insurance companies, therisk of increase of wildf
ires including as a result of t he ongoing drought, the Northern California wild fires, and the Butte fire, the Util ity may not be able to obtainsufficient insurance 
coverage in the future at comparable cost and terms as the Utility’s current insurance coverage, or at all.  In addition, the Utility is unable to predict whether it would be a
llowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses.  
Future insurance coverage 
may not be available at rates and on terms as favorable as the Utility’s cur rent insurance coverag e or may not be available at all.   If the amount of insurance is insuf
ficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to recover in rates the costs of any uninsured losses, PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s financial 
condition, results of opera tions, liquidity, and cash flows could be materi ally affected.

The electric power indust
ry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice (for example, customer-ownedgeneration and energy stor
age) and state climate policy supporti ng a decarbonized economy.  California's environmental policy objectives are accelerating the paceand scope of the industry change.  Th
e electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of new energy technologies that suppo rt California's clim ate change andGHG reduction objectives, which continu
e to be publicly supported by California policymakers notwithstanding a recent change in the federal approach to suchmatters.  California u
tilities are experiencing increasing deplo yment by customers and third p arties of DERs, such as on-site solar generation, energy storage, fuelcells, energy effic
iency, and demand response technologies.  This growth will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other thing s, accommodate two-way flows of e
lectricity, increase the grid's capacity, and interconnect DERs. 
In order to enable the 
California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy sto
rage options, EV infrastructure and s tate infrastructure modernization (e.g. rail and water project s ). 
37
 

  
To this end, the CPUC is conducting proceedings to
: evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distributi on grid in order to prepare for higherpenetration of DERs; consider fu
ture grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by DERs, andif feasible, what, if any, 
compensation to utilities wo uld be appropriate for enabling those investm ents ; and clarify the rol e of the electr ic distribution grid operator.  The CPUC 
has also recently opened proceedings regarding the   creation of a shared database or statewide census of utility poles and conduits in California and increas
ed access by communications providers to utility rights-of-way.   This proceeding could require utilities to invest significant resources intoinspecting poles and conduits, l
imit available capacity in existing rights-of-way, or im pose other requirements on utilities facilities.   The Utility is unable topredict the outcome of 
these proceedings.   
In addition, the CPUC has 
held discussions on potential changes to California’s electricity market.  On May 19, 2017, California energy companies, along with other stakeholders 
, discussed customer choice and the future of the state’s electricity industry at a CPUC “en banc” meeting.   Specifically, the goal of the “enbanc” was to frame a discuss

that technology and customer preferences wil l play in shaping this future.  While the CPUC had indicated its intent to open a proceeding related to customerchoice, the Utility is unab

The industry change, costs associ

The Utility’s electr
icity and natural gas sys tems rely on a complex, in terconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communicationtechnologies, which can be dam
aged by natural events—such as severe weather or seismic events—and by malicious events, such as cyber and ph ysical   attacks. Private and public entit
ies, such as the North American Electri c Reliability Corporation , and U.S. Government Departments, includ ing the Departments ofDefense, Homeland Security and Ene
rgy, and the White House, have noted that cyber-attac ks targeting utility syst ems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude,and frequency.  The Utility’s op
erational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure withnew technologies and 
control systems.  Any failure o r decrease in the functionality of the Utility’s operational networks could cause harm to the public oremployees, significant
ly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility’s ability   to safely generate, transport, deli ver and store energy and gas or o therwiseoperate in the most safe a
nd efficient manner or at all, and damage the Utility’s assets or operations or those of third parties.  
The Utility also relies on 
complex information technology systems that allow it t o create, collect, us e, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information,including the Utility’s f
inancial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and theirdependents, 
contractors, and other ind ividuals. In addition, the Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems , and to provide other services to 
the Utility or the Utility’s customers.  These third-party vendors could c ease to exist,   fail to establish adequate processes to protect theUtility’s systems and infor
mation, or experience security incidents or inadequate security measures .   Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility’s informationtechnology systems could impa 
ct the Utility’s ability to  track or collect revenues and to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting .  
The Utility and its third pa
rty vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to attempts to gain unauthori zed access to the Utility’s information technology syst
ems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility’s operations.   None of theseattempts or breaches h
as individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident wi th a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition and results of oper
ations.   Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be able to preve nt the unauthorized access to i
ts operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations.  Such events could subject the Utility tosignificant expenses, cl
aims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violat ion of applicable privacy laws, investigations, and regulatoryactions that could resul
t in fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reputation, any of which could have a materialadverse 
effect on PG&E Corporation’s and th e Utility’s financial condition and results of operations. 
The 
Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents .  However, there is no guarantee that adequ ate insurance wi ll continue to be availabl
e at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered byinsurance or recoverab
le in rates.

The operation of the Utili
t y’s nuclear generation facilities  exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such asrisks relating to the sto
rage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accide nt, seismic activity,natural disaster, or t
errorist act.  If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses couldhave a material e
ffect on PG&E Corpor ation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, r esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows .  In addition, the Utility m ay berequired under federa
l law to pay up to $255 million of liabilities ar ising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon f acility butat any other nuclear power p
lant in the United States.   (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)     
On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirem
ent of Diablo Canyon un its by 2024 and 2025.  However, the Utility continues to face public concern aboutthe safety of nuclear g
eneration and nuclear fuel.  Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging theactions o 
f the NRC and urging governmental ent ities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power.  Although an action in opposition may ultimatelyfail, regulatory proc
eedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete.  It is also possi ble that public pressure could grow leading to adversechanges in legislation, r
egulations, orders, or their interpretation.  As a result, operations at the Utility’s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could ceasebefore the 
ir respective license s expire in 2024 and 2025.  In such an instan ce, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of itsunrecovered investment 
and such charge could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liqu idity,and cash flows.
 
In addition, in order to re
tain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incurcosts in connection with (i) 
an employe e retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and developmentprogram, 
  to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the company .   In its January 11,2018 decision, the CPUC 
authorized rate re covery up to $211.3 million (compared with the $352.1 million requested by the Utility) for an employee retentionprogram 
, but there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilled p ersonnel under such program .  
The Utility has incurred, and 
may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders.   (See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1.Business.) 
  If the Utility were unable to re cover these costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.   The Utility maydetermine that it 
cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to ce
ase operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions.   The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceasesoperations at Diablo Canyon’s two nucl
ear generation units befor e their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025.  At December 31, 2017, the Utility’sunrecovered investment 
in Diablo Canyon was $1.7 billion. 
On June 28, 2016 the California State Lands Com
mission approved an extension of the Utility’s leases of c oastal land occupied by the wa ter intake and dischargestructures for the nucl
ear generation units at Diablo Canyon, to run concurrently with Diablo Canyon’s current operating licenses.  The Utility will be required toobtain an additional le
ase extension from the State Lands Commission to cover the period of time necessary to decommission the facility.  The State LandsCommission and California Coasta
l Commission will evaluate appropriate environmental mitigation and development conditions associated with the decommissioning project, 
the costs of which could be substantial. 
The Utility also has an obliga
tion to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, atthe end of the 
ir useful lives.   (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatement in Item 8.) 
  The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nu clear facilities through nuclear decommissioningcharges that are col
lected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit.   If theUtility’s actual deco
mmissioning costs, includin g the amounts held in the nucl ear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

The 
  Utility   purchases its nuclear fuel assemblies   for Diablo Canyon   from a sole source, W estinghouse.   The   Utility   also stores nuclear fuel inventory   at  the 
  Westinghouse   fuel fabrication facilit y.   In addition,   Westinghouse   provides the   Utility   with   Diablo Canyon   outage support services, nuclear fuelanalysis, original equipm
ent manufacturer engineering and parts support.     On March 29, 2017, Westinghouse filed for Chapter 11 protection in the Unit ed States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York. 
  On January 4, 2018, Westinghouse announced that it has agreed to be acquired by Brookfield BusinessPartners L.P. Westinghouse also indi
cated that its acquisition by Brookfield is expected to clos e in the third quarter o f 2018, subject to Bankruptcy Court approvaland customary closing condit
ions including, among others, regulatory approvals.   In the event   that   Westinghouse experiences business disrupt ions   in itsnuclear fuel business as a 
result o f bankruptcy proceedings, its p ending acquisition by Brookfield, or otherwise, the Utility could experience issues with its nuclearfuel supply and 
  delays in connection with   Diablo Canyon refueling   outages.   
Diablo Canyon’s Unit 2 refueling outag
e will oc cur in the first quart er of 2018 and the required fuel for that outage has been delivered.   The next Unit 1 refuelingoutage is expected to occu
r in the first quarter of 2019 and the fuel for that outage has not yet been fabricated.   If Westinghouse were t o fail to deliver nuclear fuel or provide 
  outage support to the Utility, the   Utility’s operation of   Diablo Canyon   would be adversely affected.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility   also couldexperience additional costs
, including decreased electricity market revenues, in the event tha t   one or both   Diablo Canyon   units are unable to operate.   Therecan be no assurance that any su
ch additional costs would be recoverable in the rates the   Utility   is permitted to recover from its customers.     Furthermore, the  Utility 
currently is not able to   estimate the nature or amount of additional costs and expenses that it might incur in connection with the uncertainties surrounding  Westinghouse but such costs and expens
es could be material. 
For
certain
critical
technologies,
pr
oducts
and
services,
the
Utility
re lies
on
a
limited
number
of
suppliers
and,
in
some
cases,
sole
suppliers.


 In
the
eventthese
suppliers
are
unable
to
perform,
the
Util
ity
could
experience
delays
and
disruptions
in
its
operations
while
it
transitions
to
alternative
plans
or
suppliers. 
The Utility relies on a l
imited number of sole source suppliers for certain of its technologies, products and services.   Although the Utility has long-termagreements with such supplie
rs, if the suppliers are unable to deliver these technolog ies, products or services, the Utility could experience delays and disruptionswhile it implements alternative 
plans and makes arrangements with acceptable substitute suppliers.   As a result, the Utility’s business, financial conditi on, and results of operations could b
e significantly affected.   As an example, the Utility relies on Silver Spring Networks, Inc. and Aclara Technologies LLC as suppliersof proprietary SmartMeter™ 
  devices and software, and of managed services, utilized in its advanced metering sy stem that collects electric and natural gas usagedata from customers. 
    If these suppliers encounter performance difficul ties or are unable to supply these dev ices or maintain and update their software, orprovide other services to 
maintain these systems, the Utility’s metering, billing, and electric network operations could be impacted and disrupted.

f
lows. 
Extreme weather, extend
ed drought and shifting climate patterns have  intensified the challenges associated wi th wildfire management in California. Environment alextremes, 
such as drought conditions followed by pe riods of wet weather, can drive additional vegetation growth ( which then fuel any fires ) and influence both the likelihood and severi
ty of extraordinary wildfire events.   In Ca lifornia, over the past five years, incons istent and extreme precipitation, coupled wi th more hotsummer days, have increas
ed the wildfire risk and made wildfire outbreaks increasingly difficu lt to manage.   In particular, the risk posed by wildfires has inc reased in 
the Utility’s service area (the Utility has approximately 82,000 distr ibution overhead circuit miles and 18,000 transmis sion overhead circuit miles) as a result of an 
extended period of drought, bark b eetle infestations in the California forest a nd wildfire fuel increases due to record rainfall fo llowing the drought,among other 
environmental facto rs. Other contributing factors include local land use policies and historical forestry management practices.  The combined effectsof extreme weather 
and climate change also impact this risk.
Severe weather 
events , including wildfires and othe r fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, drought, e arthquakes, tsunamis, pandemics, solar events, electromagneticevents, or other natural d
isasters such as wildfires, c ould result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries or loss of life,significant decreas
es in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  Any such even t could ha ve a material effect on 
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s bus iness , financial condition, r esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows .   If the Utility is unable to recover itswildfire costs, due to the r
easons described in the risk factors related t o the Northern California f ires, Butte fire, the doctrine of inverse condemnation, andinsurance limitat
ions above, or for other reasons, its financial condition, r esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.  
40
 

 Further, the 
Utility has been stu dying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on theUtility’s operations and is d
eveloping contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most signi ficant.  Scientists project that climate change will increase electricity
 demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather.  As a result, the Utility’s hydro electric generation could changeand the Utility would need t 
o consider managing or acqui ring additional generation.   If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources toreplace hydroelectric generation a
nd to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comp ly with GHG emissions limits. In addition, flooding caused by ris
ing sea levels could damage the Utility’s facilities, including generation and electric transm ission and distribution assets.  TheUtility could incur substant
ial costs to repair or replace f acilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries.  TheUtility anticipates 
that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-r ecovery may increase. 
 
Events or conditions caused by cl
imate change could have a greater impact on the Utility’s operations than the Utility’s studies suggest and could result in lowerrevenues or incr 
eased expenses, or both.  If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change,PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows cou ld be materially affected.  
The
Utility’s
operations
are
subject
to
extensive
environmental
laws
and
changes
in
or
liabilities
under
these
laws
could
adversely
affect
PG&E
Corporation’sand
the
Utility’s
financial
results.
 
The Utility’s operations a
re su bject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and orders, relating to air quality, water quality andusage, remediation of ha
zardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife.  The Utility incurs significant cap ital, operating, andother costs associated with 
compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations.  The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future,required to pay for en
vironmental remediation costs a t sites where it is ident ified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although the Utility has record
ed liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternati
ves, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other pote ntially responsible parties .  (For more information,s 
ee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  
Environmental remedi
ation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and moreexpansive application of 
existing environmental regulations.  Failure to compl y with these laws and regulations, o r failure to comply with the terms of licenses orpermits issued by environmen
tal or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or othersanction 
s.  
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to r
ecover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms.  One of thesemechanisms allows the Util
ity rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved si tes without a reasonableness review.  TheCPUC may discontinue or change these ra
temaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC hasauthorized the Utility 
to recover in ra tes.  
Some of the Utility’s environ
mental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through ratesor insurance.  (See “Environm
ental Regulation” in Item 1. and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Sta tements in Item 8.)  The Utility’s costs toremediate groundwater 
contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue tohave, a material effect o 
n PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.  Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimatedcosts and by the extent to which a
ctual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities. 
State
climate
policy
requires
reductions
in
greenhouse
gases
of
40%
by
2030
and
80%
by
2050.
 

 Various

The
future
r
ecovery
of
the
increased
costs
associated
with
compliance
is
uncertain. 
The CARB is the state’s primary regu
lator for GHG emission reduction programs.   Natural gas providers have been subject to compliance with CARB’s Cap-and-Trade Program since 2015, and natu
ral gas end-use customers have an inc reasing exposure to carbon cos ts under the Program through 2030 when the full cost willbe reflected in custo
mer bills.  CARB’s Scoping Plan also proposes various methods of reducing GHG emissions from natural gas.   These include more aggressiveenergy eff 
iciency programs to redu ce natural gas end use, increased renewable portfolio standards generation in the electric sector reducing noncore gas load, andreplacement of natural gas ap
pliances with electric appliances, leading to further reduced demand.   The se natural gas load reductions may be partially offset byCARB’s proposals to deploy natural gas to rep
lace wood fuel in home heating and diesel in transportation applications.   CARB also proposes a displacement ofsome conventional natura
l gas with above- market renewable natu ral gas.   The combination of reduced load and increased costs could result in higher natural gascustomer bills and a p
otential mandate to deliver renewable natural gas could lead to cost recovery risk.

the
Utility’s
business
and
the
Utilitymay
be
subject
to
fines
and

for
failure
to
comply
or
obtain
license
renewal.
 
The Utility must c omply with the terms of var ious governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continuedoperation of the Utility
’s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, st ate and local governmen tal agencies.  Many ofthe Utility’s capital investme
nt projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or othergovernmental permits.  T
hese permits, authorizatio ns, and licenses may be diff icult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays.  Further, existing permits andlicenses could be revoked or 
modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed whe n they were issued.  In addition, the Utility oft
en seeks periodic renewal of a license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generationfacility. 

 
If a license or permit is not renewed for a particul ar facility and the Utility i s required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairmentcharge or other costs.  Befor
e renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Uti lity’s compliance costs.  In particular, in 
connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility’s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose newlicense conditions that 
could, among other things, require increased expen ditures or result in red uced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility. 
 
In addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has no t been previously required to ob
tain.  
 
The Utility may incur penalties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect onPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial conditio n, results of operations, and c ash flows.  If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with necessarygovernmental permits, auth
orizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated complian ce and other costs in a timely manne
r, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, r esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit s for eligible employe es and retirees.  The Utility alsomaintains three trus
ts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the valueof plan assets and trust asse
ts.  A decline in the market v alue may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts.  The cost of providing pension andother postretirement benefits i
s also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimu m funding levels, the rat e of return onplan assets, employee demog
raphics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future governmentregulation, and prior cont
ributions to the plans.  Similarl y, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trustassets, changes in the laws or r
egulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptio ns or forecasts related 
to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment.  (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesof the Notes to the Consolidated Finan

Order
Instituting
an
Investigation
into
the
Utili
ty’s
Safety
Culture
On August 27, 2015, the CPUC began a formal investigation 
into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utilityprioritize safety 
and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards.  The CPUC directed the SED to evaluate theUtility’s and PG&E Corporation’s organ
izational culture, governance, policies, practices, and acc ountability metrics in relation to the Utility’s record ofoperations, including its r
ecord of safety incidents.  The CPUC authorized the SED to engage a consultant to assist in the SED’s investigation and the preparationof a report containing th
e SED’s a ssessment.  
On May 8, 2017, the CPUC President released the consul
tant’s report , accompanied by a scoping me mo and ruling.  The scoping memo establishes a second phasein this OII in which th 
e CPUC will evaluate the safety r ecommendations of the consultant that may lead to the CPUC’s adoption of the recommendations in th e report, in whole or in part.  
This phase of the proceeding wil l also consider all necessary measures, including, but not limited to, a potential reduction of the Utility’s return 
on equity until any recomm endations adop ted by the CPUC are implemented.  On November 17, 2017, the CPUC issued a phase two scoping memo and procedural schedu
le. The scoping memo directed the Utility and other parties to file testimony addressing a number of issues including adoption of the safety recommendat
ions from the consultant , the Utility’s implementation process for the safety recommendations of the consultant , the Utility’s Board ofDirector’s actions and in
itiatives related to safety culture and the consultant’s recom mendations , the Utility’s corrective action program , and the Utility’s responseto certain specifi
ed safety incidents that occurred in 2013 through 2015.   The Utility’s testimony was submitted to the CPUC on January 8, 2018 and stated that the Utility agrees with all o
f the recommendations of   the consultant and suppor ts their adoption by the CPUC.  Other parti es’ responsive testimony is due February16, 2018, and the Utility’s rebutt
al is due February 23, 2018.  On January 29, 2018, th e CPUC modified the procedural schedu le to allow more time for parties tobetter identify ar
eas of agreement to reduce the number of issues that may require hearings. 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding, including whether additiona l fines, penalties, or other ratemaking tools willultimately be adopted by 
the CPUC, and whether the CPUC will require that a portion of return on equity for the Utility be dependent on making safety progress asthe CPUC may def 
ine in this proceeding.

 Diablo
Canyon
Nuclear
 Power
Plant 
The Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant e
mploys a “once-through” cooling water system that is regulated under a Clean Water Act permit issued by the CentralCoast Board. 
This permit allows the Di ablo Canyon power plant to discharge the cooling water at a temperature no more than 22 degrees above the temperature ofthe ambient receiv
ing water, and requires that the beneficial uses of the water be protected.     The beneficial uses of water in this reg ion include industrial wat ersupply, marine and wildlife h
abitat, shellfish harvesting, and preservation of rare and endangered species.     In January   2000, the Central Coast Board issued aproposed draft cease and des
ist order alleging that, although the te mperature limit h as never been exceeded, the Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant's dischargewas not protective of benef
icial uses. 
In October 
  2000, the Utility and the Central Coast Board reached a tentative settlement under which the Central Coast Board agreed to find that the Ut ility'sdischarge of cooling water 
from the Diablo Canyon power plant protects beneficial uses and that the intake technology reflects the best technology available, asdefined in the federa
l Clean Water Act.     As part of the tent ative settlement, the Utility a greed to take measures to preserve certain acreage north of the plant andto fund approximately $6 
  million in environmental projects and future environmental monitoring related to coastal resources.     On March   21, 2003, the Ce ntral Coast Board voted to accept the s
ettlement agreement.     On June   17, 2003, the settlement agreement was executed by the Utility, the Central Coast Board andthe California Attorney Gene
ral's Office.     A condition to the effectiveness of the settlement a greement was that the Central Coast Board renew Diablo Canyon'spermit.
 
Ho 
wever, at it s July   10, 2003 meeting, the Central Coast Board did not renew the permit and continued the permit renewal hearing indefinitely.     SeveralCentral Coast Board members 
indicated that they no long er supported the settlement agreement, and the Central Coast Board requested a team of independentscientists to develop addi
tional information on possible mitigation measures for Central Coast Board staff.     In   2005, the Central Coast Board reviewed the scientists' draft report recomme
nding several such mitigation measures, but no action was taken .   
In 2010, the California Wat
er Board adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling to wers or other significant measures to reduce the 
impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%.  The policy also provided for an alternativecompliance approach for n
uclear plants if certain criteria were met .  As required by the policy, the Cal ifornia Water Board appointed a committee to evaluate thefeasibility and cost of us
ing alternative technologies to achieve compliance at Diablo Canyon.  The committee’s consultant submitted its final report to the California Water Board in Sept
ember 2014.  The report addressed feasibility, costs and timeframes to install alternative technologies at Diablo Canyon, such as coolingtowers.
 
On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirem
ent of Diablo Canyon Unit 1 by 2 024 and Unit 2 by 2025.  As a result of the planned re tirement, theCalifornia Water Board wi
ll no longer need to address alternative compliance measures for Diablo Canyon.  As required under the policy, the Utility paid anannual interim mitigation fee be 
ginning in 2017, which it will continue to pay until operations cease in 2025.  Additionally, the Utility expects that its decision toretire Diablo Canyon will af
fect the terms of a final settlement agreement between the Utility and the Central Coast Boar d regarding the therma l component of theplant’s once-through cooling d
ischarge.  
PG&E Corporation and the Utility bel
ieve that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on the Utility’s financial condition or results ofoperati 
ons.

AND
ANALYSIS
OF
FINANCIAL
CONDITION
AND


 RESULTS
OF
OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
 
PG& 
E Corporation is a holding company whose pr imary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and centralCalifornia.  The Utilit
y generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and nat ural gas to customers.  
The Utility’s base revenue 
requirements are set by the CPUC in its GRC and GT&S rate case and by the FERC in its TO rate cases based on forecast costs.    Differences between for
ecast costs and actual costs can occur for numerous rea sons, including the volume of work requ ired and the impact of market forces on thecost of labor and mater
ials.     Differences in costs can also arise from changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level.     Generally, differencesbetween a 
ctual costs and forecast c osts affect the Utility’s ability to earn its authorized return (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings”in Results of Operations below). 
    However, for certain operating costs, such as costs associated w ith pension and other employe e benefits, the Utility isauthorized to track the differe
nce between actual amounts and forecast amounts and recover or refund the difference through rates (referred to as “Utility Revenuesand Costs that did not Impact Ea
rnin gs” in Results of Operations below).     The Utility also collects revenue requirements to recover certain costs that the CPUChas authorized the Utili
ty to pass on to customers, such as the costs to procure electricity or natural gas for its customers.     Ther efore, although these costs canfluctuate, they gener
ally do not impact net income (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Results of Operations below).   See“Ratemaking Mechanisms” 
in Item 1 for further discussion. 
This is a combined report of PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility, and includes separate Consolidated Financial Statements for each of these two entities.  Thiscombined MD&A should be read in conjunc
tion with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Note s to the Consolidated Financial St atements included inItem 8.
 
Beginning on October 8, 2017, multiple wild
fires spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Del Norte, Lake,Nevada, and Yuba Counties, as well as 
in the area surrounding Yuba City ( the “Northern California wildfires”).   According to the Cal Fire California StatewideFire Summary dated October 30, 2017, a
t the peak of the wildfires, there were 21 major wildfires in California that, in total, burned over 245,000 acres, resulted in 43 fatalities, and dest
royed an estimated 8,900 structures.   Subsequently, the number of fat alities increased to 44. 
The 
fires are being investigated by Cal Fire and the CPUC , including the possible role o f the Utility’s power lines and other faci lities.  The Utility expects that CalFire will issue a report or 
reports stating its conclusions as to the sources of ignition of the fires and the way that they progressed.  The CPUC’s SED is also conducting investigations to 
as sess the compliance of electric  and communication companies’ facilities with applicable rules and regulations in fire impactedareas.  According to inform
ation made available by the CPUC, investigation topics include, but are not limited to, maintenance of facilities, vegetation management, and emerg
ency preparedness and response.  It is uncertain when the investigations will be complete and whether Cal Fire will release any preliminary findings be
fore its investigation is complete.   
PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility’s financi al condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flow s could be materially affected by potentia l losses resultingfrom the impact of th
e Northern California wildfires.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors .  
Tax
Cuts
and
Jobs
Act
of
201
7 
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enac
ted expansive tax legislation commonly refer red to as the Tax Act. 

Among other provisions, the Tax Actreduces the federal 
income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning on January 1, 2018 and elim inated bonus depreciation for utilities.  
50 
 

 The Tax Act also required PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility to re-measure existing deferred income tax assets and liabilities to reflect the lower federal tax rate. During the three months and yea
r ended December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation , on a consolidated basis, recorded a one-time provisional tax expense of $147million to reflec
t the transitional impacts of the Tax Act.  Of this amount, $83 million is attributable to the re-measurement of PG&E Corporation’s n et deferred tax asset comprised pri
marily of net operating loss carry - forwards and compensation-related items.  The remaining $64 million is related to the re-measurement ofthe Utility’s deferr
ed taxes not reflected in authorized revenue requirements, such as  disallowed plant.  The Utility also recorded a provisional $5. 7 billion re- measurement of 
its deferred tax balances ( related to flow-through and normalized timing differences for plant-related items ) which was offset by a change from a net deferred income 
tax regulatory asset t o a net regulatory liab ility.   The net deferred income tax regulatory liability will be refunded to customers over theregulatory lives of the 
related assets.  The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may materi ally vary from the above recorded amounts due to, among other things, 
future regulatory decisions fro m the CPUC that could differ from the Utility’s determination of how the impacts of the Tax Act are allocated betweencustomers and shareholders. 
 
As a r 
esult of the Tax Act, the Util ity intends to file by the end of March 2018 (i) revised revenue requir ements and rate base in its 201 7 GRC (for years 2018 and 2019) and 
2015 GT&S rate case (for 2018) as well as a proposed implementat ion plan in connection t hereto, and (ii) revis ed revenue requirement and rate baseforecast 
in its 2019 GT&S rate case.  The Util ity is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the CPUC decision i n connection with such filing s . 
On an aggregate basis, t 
he Utility anticipates an annual reduction to rev enue requirements of approximately $500 million starting in 2018 , and incrementalincrease 
s to rate base of approximately $500 million in 2018 and $800 million in 2019 as a result of the Tax Act .  The estimated benefi t to customer s is driven by the lower federal inco
me tax rate applied to future earn ings and the return of excess de ferred income taxes.  These benefits are partially offset by earnings onhigher rate base and lower 
tax benefits from flow-through items. 
In addition to this reduct
ion in future revenue requirements, the Tax Act is expected to accelerate when PG&E Corporation resumes paying federal taxes , primarily due to the e
limination of bonus depreciation ; although future taxes are expected to be lower due to the lower fede ral tax rate.  PG&E Corporation now expects to pay federal 
taxes starting in 2020 , although that timing would be i mpacted by any significant changes to future results of operations .  Add itionally, because the revenue redu
ction is expected to precede the reduction in federal income tax payments, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s op erating cash flows willbe negatively impact
ed resulting in additional financing needs.

m operations for the three months and twelve months ended Dece mber 31, 2017 compared to the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 
and a summary reconcil iation of the key drivers of PG&E Corporation’s earnings from operations and EPS based on earnings from operations for th 
e three months and twelve mon ths ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 .  “ 
Earnings from operations ” is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as income availab le for common shareholde rs less items impacting comparability.  
“ Items impacting comparability ” represent items that managem ent does not consider part of the normal course of operations and affect comparab ility of financialresults between periods. 
  PG&E C orporation uses earnings fro m operations to understand and compare operating results across reporting periods for variouspurposes including internal b 
udgeting and forecasting, shor t and long-term operating p lans, and employee incentive co mpensation .   PG&E Corporation believes that earnings from oper
ations provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business allowing for a better comparison against historical results andexpectations for futur
e performance .  E arnings from operations are not a substitute or altern ative for GAAP measures such as income av ailable for common shareholders 
and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Key
Factors
Affecting
Financial
 Results  
PG&E Corporation and the Utility bel
ieve that their financial condition, r esults of operations, liquidity , and cash flows may be materiall y affected by the following factors: 
 
The
Impact
of
the
Northern
California
Wild
fires
.

 PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financ ial condition, results of operations, liquidity , and cashflows could be 
materially affected by potentia l losses resulting from the impact of the Northern California wildfires.  The Utility incurred costs of $219 million for service 
restoration and repai rs to the Utility’s facilities (includin g an estimated $97 mill ion in capital expenditur es) in connection with thesefires.  
PG&E Corporation’s and t he Utility’s financial co ndition, results of operat ions, liquidity , and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utilityis 
unable to recover such costs through CEMA.  If the Utility’s facilities, s uch as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be thecause of one or more fir
es , and the d octrine of inverse conde mnation applies, the Utility could be liab le for property damages, interest, and attorneys’fees with 
out having been found negligent , which liability, in the agg regate, could be substantial.  In addition to such claims, as well as c laims under other theories of liab
ility, the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs , evacuation costs, medic al expenses, personal injury damages, and o therdamages if the Utility we
re found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggreg ate, could be substantial and have a material effect on PG&ECorporation and the Utility 
.   Further, the Utility also could be subject to material fines or penalties if the CPUC or any other law enforcement agencybrought an enforcement a
ction and determine d that the Utility fai led to comply with applicable laws and regulations.   If the Utility were to de termine thatit is both probable that a 
loss has occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, a liability would be recorded consistent with the principles discussed in Note 
13 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 .  To the extent not offset by insu rance recoveries, the liability wouldaffect the balanc
e sheet equity of PG&E Corporation and the Utility .  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 1 3 to Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements 
in Item 8 and Item 1A. Risk Factors.) 
 
The
Applicability
of
the
Doctrine
of
Inverse
Condemnation
in
PG&E
Corporation
and
the
Utility’
s
Wildfire
 Litigation.
 The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by 
courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potentialshareholder liabilities from s
uch litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’ s financial condition, r esults of operations, liquidityand cash flows. Although the imposition o
f liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from theircustomers, there can be no gu
arantee that the CPUC would authorize cost recove ry even if a court decision imposes liability under the doctrine of inversecondemnation.  
I n December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of thedoctrine o 
f inverse condemnation, hold ing that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC’s prudent managerstandard.  That determin
ation is being challenged by San Diego Gas & Electric as well as by the Utility and Southern California Edison.  (See “Enforcement and Litig
ation Matters” in Note 13 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and Item 1A. Risk Factors.) 
The
Tax
Cut
and
Jobs
Act
.

 O n December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted expansive tax leg islation commonly ref erred to as the Tax Act . Among other provisions, the Tax Act redu
ces the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning on January 1, 2018 and eliminate s bonus depreciation for uti
lities.  As a result of the Tax Act, beginning in 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility an ticipate a reduction in revenues, lower effective income tax rates 
and lower income tax expense .  In addition, the Utility expects a rate base increase primarily due to the elimination o f bonusdeprecia 
tion.  (See “The Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017” and “Regul atory Matters” in this Item 7. MD&A and Note 3 and Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial State
ments.) 
The
Outcome
of
Enforcement,
Litigation,
and
Regula
tory
Matters.

The Utility’s financia l results may continue to be impacted by the outcome of currentand future enforcemen
t, litigation, and regulatory matters, including the impact of the Northern California wildfi res, the Butte fire, the safety culture OIIand any rela 
ted fines, penalties, or o ther ratemaking tools that could be imposed by the CPUC, including as a result of the phase two of the proceeding,the ex parte OII and the r
elated proposed decision, the potential recommendations that the third-party monitor ( ret ained by the Utility in the first quarterof 2017 as part 
of its compliance with the sentencing terms of the Utility’s January 27, 2017 federal cri minal conviction) may make, and potential penalties in connection wi
th the Utility’s safety and other self-re ports.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8 , Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Item 1A. Risk Factors .)  
The
Timing
and
Ou
tcome
of
Ratemaking
Proceedings.

 The Utility’s financial results may be impacted by the timing and ou tcome of its 2019 GT&S rate case, and FERC TO18 and TO19 rate cases, as well as th
e recent remand decision by the Ninth Circuit regarding an ROE adder for transmission facilities.  
(See “Regulatory Matters – 2019 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case ” and “Regulatory Matters − FERC Transmission Owner Rate Cases ” belowfor more information.)  
The outcome of regulatory p roceedings can be affected by many factors, including intervening parties’ testimonies, potentia l rate impacts, the Utility’s 
reputation, the regulatory and political environments, and other factors. 
The
Ability
of
the
Utility
to
Control
and
Recover
Operating
Costs
and
Capital
Expenditures.

 In any given year the Utili ty’s ability to earn its author ized rate of return depends on i
ts ability to manage costs within the amounts authorized in rate case decisions.   The Utility forecasts that in 201 8 it will incurunrecovered pipeline-relat 
ed expenses ranging from $35 mi llion to $60 million which primarily relate to costs to identify  and remove encroachmentsfrom transmission pipel
ine rights-of-way.  Also, the CPUC decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case establishe d various cost caps that will increasethe risk of overspend over 
the rate case cycle th rough 2018. (See “Disallowance of Plant Costs ” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidate d Financial Statements in Item 8 
.)  
55
 

 
 
 
The
Amount
and
Timing
of
the
Utility’s
Financing
Needs.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access the capital markets, ability to borrow under its loan financin
g arrangements and the terms and rates of future financings could be materially affected by the outcome of, or market perception of,the matters discussed in Not
e 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financi al Statements, including liabilities, if any, incurred in relation to the NorthernCalifornia wildfires, adv
erse effects on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to comply with consolidated debt to total capitalization ratiocovenants in their finan 
cing arrangements and reg ulatory capital structure requirements resulting therefrom, adverse changes in their respective creditratings, general econom
ic and market conditions, and other factors.  PG&E Corporation contributes equity to the Utility as neede d to maintain the Utility’s CPUC-au 
thorized capital st ructure.  In 201 7 , PG&E Corporation issued $416 mil lion of common stock and made equity contributions of $455million to the Utility 
.  PG&E Corporation forecasts that it will need to continue to issue a material amount of equity in future years, primarily to supportthe Utility’s capita
l expenditures.  PG&E Corporation may seek to issue additional equity to fund unrecoverable pipeline-related expenses and to payclaims, losses, fines, and pen
alties that may be required by the outco me of litigation and enforcement matters.  Additional issuances of equity, if any,could have a materia
l dilutive impact on PG&E Corporation’s EPS. 
Changes
in
the
Utility
Industry.


 The Utility is committed to delivering safe, reliable, sustainable, and  affordable electric and gas services to itscustomers.  Increasing de
mands from state laws and policies relating to increased renewable energy resources, the reduction of GHG emissions, theexpansion of energy effic
iency programs , the development and widespre ad deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, and thedevelopment of energy stor
age technologies have increased pressure on the Utility to achieve efficiencies in its operations while continuing to pro vide customers with safe, rel
iable, and affordable service.  The utility industry is also undergoing transformative chang e driven by technological advancementsenabling customer choic
e (for example, customer-owned gen eration and energy storag e) and state c limate policy supporting a decarbonized economy. California’s environmental 
policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of the industry change.  The electric grid is a critical ena bler of theadoption of new energy technologi
es that support Cali fornia's climate ch ange and GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported byCalifornia policy make
rs notwithstanding a recent change in the fed eral approach to such ma tters.  In order to enable the Cal ifornia clean energyeconomy, sust 
ained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy s torage options, EV 
infrastructure and s tate infrastructure modernization (e.g. rail and water projects).   The Utility forecasts ove r $ 1 billion in gri d investments through 2020, 
which would include increased re mote control and sensor technology of the grid, integration inv estments in connection with DER bi-directional energy flows and voltage fluc
tuations , advanced grid data analy tics, g rid storage that enables renewable integration, expanded infrastructure for light,medium 
, and heavy-duty EVs, transmission integration for renewables, and energy efficiency and demand response programs.  In addition, these changes brought about by technol 
ogical advancements and climate policy may cause a reduction in natural gas usage and increase natural g as costs.  The combination of reduced 
natural gas load and incr eased costs could result in higher natural gas customer bills and potential cost recovery risk.  
For more information about 
the factors and risks that could affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity , and cash flows, or that could 
cause future results to d iffer from historical results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors .  In addition, this 201 7 Form 10-K contains forward- looking statements that are

E Corporation’s net income cons ists primarily of income taxes, interest expense on long-term debt, and other income from investments.  The decrease inPG&E Corporation’s net income for 2017, 
as compared to 2016 , is primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act and interest expense, partially offset by the impactof the San Bruno Derivative Litig
ation.  Results include approximately $30 million of realized gains and associated tax benefits related to an investment inSolarCity Corporation recogniz

Utility
 
The table below shows certain i
tems from the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Income for 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 .  The table separately identifies the revenuesand costs that impacted 
earnings from those that did not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is author ized to pass through direct ly to customers (such as costs to purchase elec
tricity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose programs) and the corresponding amount of revenues collected to recoverthose pass-through costs, do not impa
ct earni ngs.  In addition, expenses that hav e been specifically authorized (such as the payment of pension costs) and thecorresponding revenues the Uti
lity is authorized to collect to recover such costs, do not impact earnings. 
Revenues 
that impact earnings are primarily those that h ave been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility’s costs to own and operate its assetsand to provide the Utility an oppo
rtunity to earn its authorized rate of return on rate base.  Expenses that i mpact earnings a re primarily those th at the Utility incursto own and operate its assets.

that
Impacted
Earnings

The following discussion presents th
e Utility’s operating results for 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , focusing on revenues and expenses th at impacted earnings for theseperiods.
 
Operating
Revenues
 
The Utility’s electr
ic and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $ 144 m illion , or 1% in 2017 compared to 2016 , primarily due tohigher electric t
ransmission revenues .  
The Utility’s electr
ic and natura l gas operating revenues th at impacted earnings increased $1.2 billion or 13% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily as a result ofapproximately $700 mill
ion of incremental revenues authorized in the 2015 GT&S rate case and approximately $425 million of addi tional base revenues as authorized by the CPUC in the 2014 GRC decision and by the FERC in the TO 
17 rate case.

Operating
and
Maintenance

The Utility’s operating and 
maintenance expenses that impacted earnings decreased $ 675 m illion , or 12% , in 2017 compared to 2016 .  In 2017, the Utility incurred 
$4 55 million less in disallowed charges ( t he Utility recorded a $47 million disallowance related to the Diablo Canyon settlement in 2017 as compared to $ 
502 million of disallowed capital charges related to the San Bruno P enalty D ecision and 2015 GT&S rate case decision in 2016) and $ 447 million less in charges related to th
e Butt e fire (the Utility recorded $ 410 million in charges in 2017 as compared to $ 857 million in 2016) .   These decreases were partiallyoffset by 
insurance recoveries related to  the Butte fire decreasing by approximately $ 275 million (the Utility recorded $350 million in insurance r ecoveries in 2017 as compared to approxima
tely $ 625 million in 2016).   ( S ee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  
The Utility’s operating and 
maintenance expenses that impacted earnings increased $ 385 million , or 7% , in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to $857million in charges for 
third-party claims, Utility clean-up, repair, and legal costs related to the Butte fire, $219 million in permanently disallowed capital spending,$34 million in 
charges recorded in conne ction with the final CPUC decision related to the natural gas distribution facilities record-keeping investigation, the federalcriminal trial, and the atmosp
heric corrosion inspection self-report, $24 million in higher pipeline-re lated expenses and legal and regulatory related expensesduring 2016, an escalation re
lated to labor, benefits, and service contracts, and accelerated transmission and distribution project work.  These increases werepartially offset by $500 m
illion in cha rges associated with the San Bruno Penalty Decision for custome r refunds and fines incurred in 2015 with no correspondingcharges in 2016 and approximat
ely $125 million in lower disallowed capital charges associated with the San Bruno Penalty Decision in 2 016.  Additionally, the Utility recorded approxi
mately $576 million more in insurance recoveries (in 2016, the Utility record ed $625 million in insurance r ecoveries related to the Buttefire as compared to $49 m
illion of insurance recoveries for third-part y claims related to the San Bruno accident in 2015 ) . 
T 
he Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of theNorthern California wildfi
res and an y additio nal charges associated wi th costs related to the Butt e fire.   (See Item 1A. Risk Factors above and Note 1 3 of theNotes to the Consolidated Financia
l Statements in Item 8. )  
Depreciation,
Amortization,
and
Decommissioning
 
The Utility’s deprecia
tion, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased $ 100 million , or 4% in 2017 compared to 2016 and $ 143 million , or 5% in2016 
compared to 2015 .  In 201 7 , the increase was primarily due to the i mpact of capital additions and higher depreciation rates as authorized by the CPUC inthe 2017 GRC 
.  In 201 6 , the increase was primarily due to the impact of capital additions.  
Intere
st
Expense 
The Utility’s 
interest expenses increased by $ 58 million, or 7% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.  The Utility’s interest exp
enses increased by $ 56 million , or 7% in 201 6 compared to 201 5 , primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.

Income
Tax
Provision
 
The Utility’s income tax p
rovision increased $ 357 million in 2017 compared to 2016 .  The increase in the tax provision was prima rily the result of the statutorytax effect 
of higher pre-tax income in 201 7 compared to 201 6 and an adjustment requir ed to record the change in deferred tax balances due to tax reform in 2017with no comparable adjustm
ent in 2016.   (For more information see “Tax Reform” below and Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.) 
The Utility’s income tax 
provision increased $89 mil lion in 2016 compared to 2015.  The increas e in the tax provis ion was primarily the resu lt of the statutory taxeffect of higher pre-tax income
 in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by higher tax benefits from property-related timing differences in 2016 compared to2015.  The higher effective 
tax rate was driven by higher pre-tax earnin gs in 2016, partially offset by rate impact from property-related timing differences.

I nclude s the effect of federal flow-through ratemaking treatment for certain property-related costs a s authorized by the 2014 GRC decision in all periods presented and by the 2015 GT&S decision which impacted 2016 and 2017.  All amounts are impacted by the leve
l of income before income taxes.  The 2014 GRC and 2015 GT&S rate case decisions authorized reve nue requirements that reflect flow-through ratemaking for temporary income tax differences attributable to repair costs and certain other property-related costs for federal tax purposes.  For these
temporary tax differences, PG&E Corporation and the Utilit 
y recognize the deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities.  Therefore, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s effective tax rates are impacted as these differences arise and reverse.  PG&E Corporation a 
nd the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probable that 
these amounts will be recovered from or returned to customers in future rates.  (

Utility
Revenues
and
Costs
that

Earnings
 
Fluctuations in revenues tha
t did not impact earnings are primarily driven by procurement costs (see below for more detail). 
Cost
of
Electricity

The 
Utility’s cost of electricity includes the cost of power purchased from third p arties (including renewable energy resources), transmission, fuel used in its owngeneration facili
ties, fuel supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade prog ram, and realized gains and losses on price risk m
anagement activities.   (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The Utility’s total purch asedpower is driven by customer dem
and, the availability of the Utility’s own g eneration facili ties (including Diablo Canyon and its hydroelectric plants), and the cost-effectiveness of each source
 of electricity .

Average cost of purchased power was impacted primarily by lower Utility electric customer demand due to their departure to CCAs or direct access providers and a larger percentage of highercost renewable energy resource 
s being allocated to fewer remaining Utility electric customers.   See further discussion in Item 7. MD&A, “Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives - Power Charge Indifference Adjustment OIR 
”, below.  ( 
2) The decrease in purchased power for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due t o lower Utility electric customer demand and an increase in generation from hydroelectric facilit ies.

 Cost
of
Natural
Gas 
The Utility’s cost of natur
al gas includes the costs of procurement, storage and transportation of natural gas, costs to comply with California’s cap-and -tradeprogram, and realized g
ains and losses on price risk management activities.   (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The Utility’s cost of natura
l gas is impacted by the market price of natural gas, changes in the cost of storage and transportation, and changes in customer demand.

Operating
and
Maintenance
Expenses
 
The Utility’s 
operating expenses that did no t impact earnings include certain costs that the Utility is authorized to recover as incurred such as pension contributionsand public purpose programs costs.  
If the Utility were to spend more than authorized amounts, these expenses could have an impac t to earnings.  For 201 7 , 2016, 
and 201 5 , no material amounts were incurred above authorized amounts.

RES
OURCES
Overview
 
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directo
rs of PG&E Corporation and the Utili ty suspended quarterly cash div idends on both PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s common stock, beginn
ing the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018,due to the uncertaint 
y related to the causes o f and potential liabilities associated with the Northern California wildfires.  ( See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements in Item 8.)   
The Utility’s ability to 
fund operations , fi nance capital expenditures, and make distributions to PG&E Corpora tion depends on the levels of its operating cashflows and access to the capi
tal and credit markets.  The CPUC authorizes the Utility’s capita l structure, the aggregate amount of long-term a nd short-term debt that the Utility may issue 
, and the revenue require ments the Utility is able to collect to recover its cost of capital.  The Utility generally utilize s equity contributionsfrom PG&E Corporation and long-ter
m senior unsecured debt issuan ces to maintain its CPUC-authori zed capital structure consisting of 52% equity and 48% debt and preferred sto 
ck.  (See “R egulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A. )   The Utility relies on short-term debt, including commercial paper, to fund temporaryfinancing ne 
eds.   
PG&E Corporation’s ability to fund ope
rations, make scheduled principal and interest payments, fund equity contributions to the Utility , and declare and pay dividends primarily depends on 
the level of cash distributions received from the Utility and PG&E Corporation’s access to the capital and credit markets.  PG&E Corporation’s equity contribu
tions to the Utility are funded primarily through common stock issuances.   PG&E Corporation has material stand-alone cash flowsrelated to 
the issuance of equity and long -term debt, and issuances and repayments under its revolving credit f acility and commercial paper program.  PG&ECorporation relies on short-
term deb t, including commerci al paper, to fund temporary financing needs. 
61
 

 PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
credit ratings may be affected by the ultimate outcome of pending enforcement and litigation matters, including the outcomeof the uncertainties 
and pot ential liabilit ies associated with the Northern California wildfires.  Credit rating downgrades may in crease the cost and availability ofshort-term borrowing, includ
ing commercial paper, the costs associated with credit facilities, and long-term debt cost s.  In addition, some of the Util ity’scommodity contracts contain
 collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies.   In December 2017, following PG&E Corporation’s announcemen
t that it was su spending its divide nd due to the uncertainty related to the causes and potential liabilities associatedwith the Northern California wi
ldfires, all of the ratings of PG&E Corporation and the Utility were placed under review for downgrade by Moody’s Investo r Services.  Additionally, in Dece
mber 2017, Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings lowered the Utility’s preferred stock credit rating and placed all of the ratings ofPG&E Corporation and the Utility on Credi
tWatch with negative implications.  If the Utility’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the Utility wouldbe required to post a
dditional cash immediately to fully collateralize some of its net liability positions .  (See Note s 9 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 
Item 8.)   
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
equity needs could increase materially and its liquidity and cash flows could be materially affected by potential costs andother liabilities 
in connection with the Northern California wildfires.  T he Utilit y’s equity needs will also continue to be affected by the timing and amount of disallowed capital expend
itures, and by fines , penalties and claims that may be imposed in connection with the matters describe d in “Enforcement and Lit igationMatters” in Note 
13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Fina ncial Statements in Item 8 .  In addition, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access thecapital markets in 
a manner consistent with its past practices, if at all, could be adversely affected by such matt ers.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.)  
As 
a result of the Tax Act, the Utility anticipates an annual reduction to revenue requirements of approximat ely $500 million starting in 2018.  In addition to this reduction in future reven
ue requirements, the Tax Act’s other provisions, in particular the elimination of bonus depreciation, are expected to accelerate whenPG&E Corporation resumes paying fede
ral taxes; although future taxes will be lower due to the lower f ederal tax rate.  PG&E Corporation now expects to pay federal taxes starting in 
2020 , although that timing would be i mpacted by any significant changes to future results of operations .  Additionally, because therevenue redu 
ction is expected to prece de the reduction in federal income tax payments, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s op erating cash flows will benegatively impacted 
resulting in additional financing need s .

In November 2017, the Utility issued $1,150 
million principal amount of 3.30% senior notes due December 1, 2027 and $850 million principal amount of 3.95% senior notes due December 1, 2047.  The p
roceeds were used to repay all of the $700 million outstanding principal amount of its 5.63% senior notes due November 30, 2017, all of the $250 million f
loating rate unsecured term loan maturing Feb ruary 22, 2018 and $400 million of the 8.25 % senior notes due October 15, 2018,and the balance, for gene

 In November 2017, the Utility issued $500 
million of floating rate senior notes due November 28, 2018.  The proceeds were use d towards repayment of the $250 million unsecured floa
ting rate notes due November 30, 2017 and the balance was used to support the Northern California wildfire response efforts. 
On January 9, 2018, the Utility sent a not
ice of redemption to redeem all $4 00 million aggregate pr incipal amount of the 8.25% senior notes due October 15, 2018on February 18, 2018.  On January 31, 2018, the Utility depos

Operating
Activities
 
The Utility’s cash flows from op

require the use of cash.  During 2017, net cash provided by operat ing activities increased by $ 1.6 billion compared to 2016.  This increase was primarily 
due to additional elec tric and natural gas operating revenues collected as authorized by the CPUC in the 2015 GT&S rate cas e, the $400 million refund to natural gas custo
mers in the second quarter of 2016, as required by the San Bruno Penalty Decision (with no corresponding activity in 2017), and thereceipt of approximately $3
00 million of insurance recoveries related to the Butte fire in 2017 as compar ed to $50 million of insurance recoveries related to theButte fire during 2016. 
 
64
 
 

 During 
2016 , net cash provided by operating activities in creased by $ 597 million compared to 2015 .  This in crease was partially due to the Utili ty receiving an additional $170 million in 
tax refunds in 2016 as compared to 2015.  The remaining increase was primarily due to fluctuations in activities within the normalcourse of business such as timing 
and amount of customer billings and vendor billi ngs and payments. 
Future cash flow from operat
ing activities will be affected by various factors, including: 
the timing and amount of cos
ts in connection with the Northern California wildfires, as well as potential liabilities in connection with third- party claims and fines or penalties th
at could be imposed on the Utility if the CPUC or any other law enforcement agency brought an enforcement action anddetermined that the Ut
ility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations; 
the timing and am 
ounts of costs , including fines and penalt ies, that may be incurred in connection with the current and future enf orcement, litigation, andregulatory matters, includin
g the impact of the Butte fire and the timing and amount of related insurance recoveries, the safety culture OII, including otherratemaking tools that 
could be imposed by the CPUC as a result of the phase two of the proceeding, the ex parte OII and the related proposed decision,costs associated with 
potential recommend ations that the third-p arty monitor may make related t o the Utility’s conviction in the federal criminal trial, andpotential 
penalties in connection wi th the Utility’s safety and other self-reports ;  
the Tax Act, whic
h is expected to accelerate the timing of federal tax payment s and reduce revenue requi rements, resulting in lower operating cash flows; 
the timing and outcome 
s of the 2019 GT&S, TO18, and TO19 rate cases and other r atemaking and regulatory proceedings ;  
the timing and amount of cos
ts the Utility incurs, but does n ot recover, associated wi th its electric and natural gas system s ; and  
the timing of the resolu
tion of the Chapter 11 disputed claims and the amount of principal and interest on these claims that the Utility will be required topay.

Investing
Activities
 
Net cash used in investing act
ivities increased by $124 million during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures.   Net cashused in investing activit
ies in creased by $ 315 million during 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to an inc rease of approximately $440 million in capitalexpenditures, partial
ly offset by an increase in restricted cash released from escrow by approximately $160 million.  
Future cash flows used in investing a
ctivities are largely de pendent on the timing and amoun t of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incurapproximately $ 
6.3 billion in capital exp enditures in 2018 and $6.0 billion in 2019 .  
Financing
Activities
 
During 2017, net cash provided by financ
ing activities decreased by $ 1.1 billion as compared to 2016.  This decrease was primarily due to net commercialrepayments of $972 million 
in 2017 as compared to net rep ayments of $9 million in 2016.  During 2016 , net cash pro vided by financing activi ties de creased by $ 274 
million as compared to 2015 .  Cas h provided by or used in financing activities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by or used in operating a
ctivities, the level of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity dateof existing debt instrumen
ts.  The Utility generally utilizes long-term debt issu ances and equity contribut ions from PG&E Corporation to maintain its CPUC-authorized capital s
tructure, and relies on short-term debt to fund temporary financing needs.

 R
EGULATORY
MATTERS 
The Utility is subject to subst
antial regulation by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC , and other federal and state regulatory ag encies.  The resolutions of these and other proceedings may af
fect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financ ial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
The Utility is still ana
lyzing the impact of the Tax Act on revenue requirements and rate base for the 2017 GRC, the 2015 GT&S Rate Case, the recently submitted2019 GT&S Rate C 
ase, and the pending TO19 rate cas e.  However, on an aggregate basis, the Utility currently anticipates an annual reduction to revenuerequirements of approxi
mately $500 million starting in 2018, and incremental increases to rate base of approximately $500 million in 2018 and $800 million in2019, as a result of the Tax Act.   
 
As a result of the Tax Act, the Uti
lity intends to file by the end of March 2018 (i) revised revenue requirements and rate base in its 2017 GRC (for years 2018 and2019) and 2015 G 
T&S rate case (for 2018) as we ll as a proposed implementation plan in connection thereto, and (ii) revised revenue requirement and rate baseforecast in its 2019 GT&S rate 
case.  The Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the CPUC decision in connection with such filings.  As dis cussedbelow, the 2017 GRC final decision establ
ished a tax memorandum account to track revenue differences resulting from tax law changes, among other items, fordisposition in the 2020 GRC.  The March filing 
s will accelerate that timing.  (Se e “Tax Cut s and Jobs Act of 2017” in Item 7. MD&A and Note 3 and Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financ
ial Statements.) 
2017
General
Rate
Case
 
On May 11, 2017, the CPUC issued a final decision in the Ut
ility’s 2017 GR C, which determined the annual amount of base revenues (or “revenue requirements”)that the Utility is autho
rized to collect from customers from 2017 through 2019 to recover its anticipated costs for electric distribution, natural gas distribution, andele 
ctric generation operations and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return.  The final decision approved, with certainmodifications, the set
tlement agreement that the Utility, the ORA, TURN, and 12 other intervening partie s jointly submitted to the CPUC on August 3, 2016 (the “settlement agreement”).  Modificatio
ns from the settlement agreement to the final decision included a tax memorandum account and approval of a stand-aloneapplication with the CPUC or a filing 
in the CPUC’s ongoing residential rate re form proceeding to recover customer outreach and other costs incurred as a result ofresidential rate reform implementation.
  The new tax memorandum account will track any revenue differences resulting from changes in inco me tax expense caused by net revenue changes, 
mandatory or elective tax law changes, tax accounting changes, tax procedural changes, or tax policy changes during the 2017through 2019 GRC period.  The account will rem
ain open and the balance in the account will be reviewed in every subsequ ent GRC proceeding until a CPUCdecision closes the accoun
t. 
67
 

 The final decision approved 
a revenue requirement increase of $88 million for 2017, with additional increases of $444 million in 2018 and $361 million in 2019, in line with the amounts proposed in 
the settlement agreement.  The following table shows the revenue requirement amounts approved in the final decision based online of business and cost cat

eduction announcement and on July 10, 2017, providing an update of the cost effectiv eness study for the SmartMet er™Upgrade project.  On February 8, 2018, the CPUC exte 
nded the statutory deadlin e for the 2017 GRC from February 8, 2018 to August 9, 2018, in order to allowfor comments and CPUC action on any PD on the SmartM
eter TM Upgrade cost effectiveness study, as well as one other remaining GRC compliance item. 
2020
General
Rate
Case
The Utility expects to fi
le the 2020 GRC by September 1, 2018. On November 30, 2017, the Utility filed its first RAMP submittal to the CPUC in advance of its 2020 GRC filing. 
  The RAMP is a new CPUC requirement directing each large energy utility to submit a report describing how it assesses its risks and how itplans to mitigate and m
inimize such risks in advance of the utility’s GRC applica tion.  The objective of this filing is to inform the CPUC of the Utility’s topsafety-related r
isks, risk assessment procedures, and proposed mitigations of those risks for 2020-2022.   
The SED is expected to submit a repo
rt on the Utility’s RAMP submitta l and hold a workshop on the report, af ter which parties will have the opportunity to filecomments.  The RAMP results will be inco
rporated in the Utility’s 2020 GRC.

Gas

Storage
Rate
Case
 
During 2016, the CPUC issued 
final decisio n s in phase one and phase two of the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case .  T he phase one decision adopted the revenuerequirements that th
e Utility is authorized to collect through rates beginning August 1, 2016, to recover its costs of gas transmission and stor age services for the 2015 GT&S rate case period 
(2015 through 2018).  The phase two decision determined the allo cation of the $850 million penalty assessed in the San Bruno Penalty Decision and the revenu
e requirement reduction for the five-month delay cau sed by the Utility’s violat ion of the CPUC ex parte communication rules inthis proceeding. 
 
68
 

 The phase one decision excluded 
from rate base $696 mil lion of capital spending in 2011 through 2014 in excess of the amount adopted.  The decision permanently d 
isallow ed $120 m illion of that amount and o rdered that the remaining $57 6 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Util
ity may seek recovery in a future proceeding .  A draft of the audit repor t is expected in the first quarter of 2018.  Th e decision establishednew one-way balancing accounts to 
track costs as well as various cost caps that will increase the risk of disallowance over the current rate case cycle .  The Utility would be required to take a ch
arge i n the future if the CPUC’s audit of 2011 th rough 2014 capital spending resulted in additional permanent disallowance. 
In August 2016 and January 2017, TURN, ORA and Indicated Shippers filed 
applications for rehearing of the phase one and phase two decisi ons, respectively. The Utility cannot predic
t when or if the CPUC will grant the rehearing s or if it will adop t the parties’ reco mmendations.  Additionally, in June 2017, the Utili tyfiled a PFM of the phase one decis
ion to eliminate the requirement that the Utility install new cathodic protection systems in 2018 because the Util ity is not in aposition to identify the opt
imal location for such new systems in 2018.  Instead, the Utility requ ested to be allowed to continue its current cathodic protection pr ogram.  
As directed by the CPUC, on August 23, 2017, the Utility provided supp lemental information to the CPUC regarding the PFM.  The Utility is unable to predict if and when the CPUC would adopt the PFM 
.  In the event the PFM is not adopted and the Utili ty fails to perform th e mandated new cathodic protection systems, the Utility could in
cur fines and penalties, the amount of which the Utility is unable to predi ct. 
2019
Gas
Transmission
and
Storage
Rate
Case
 
On November 17, 2017, the Utility filed 
its 2019 GT&S rate case applicat ion with the CPUC, covering the years 2019 through 2021.  While the Utility has notformally proposed a fourth y
ear for this rate case, it provided a revenue requirement and rates for 2022, in the event the CPUC adopts an additio nal year.  
In its application, the Ut
ility requested that the CPUC authorize a 2019 revenue requirement of $1.59 billion to recover anticipated costs of providing natural gastransmission and storage se
rvices beginning on January 1, 2019.   This corresponds to an increase of $289 mil lion over the Utility’s 2018 authorized revenuerequirement of $1.30 bill
ion.   The Utility’s request also includes proposed revenue requirements of $1.73 billion for 2020, $1.91 billion for 2021, and $1.91 billionfor 2022 if the 
CPUC orders a fourth year for the ra te case period. 
The requested rate base 
for 2019 is $4.66 billion, which corresponds to an increase of $0.95 billion over the 2018 authorized rate base of $3.71 billion.   These ratebase amounts exclude approxi
mately $ 576 million of capital sp ending subject to audit by the CPUC related to 2011 through 2014 expenditures in excess ofamounts adopted in the 2011 GT&S rate 
case.   The Utility is unable to predict whether the $576 million, or a portion thereof, will ultimatel y be authorized by the CPUC and included in the Utility’s futur
e rate base.   The Utility’s request also excludes rate base adjustments that the Utility requested with the CPUC onNovember 14, 2017, resulting from th
e IRS’s October 5, 2017 private letter ru ling issued in connection with th e CPUC’s final phase two decision in the 2015GT&S rate case.  The Utility’s 
request is based on capital expenditure forecasts of $971 million for 2019, $963 million for 2020, and $804 million for 2021 (whichexclude common 
capital allocations).  
The increase in revenue re
quirement is largely attributable to increased infrastructure investment and costs related to new natural gas storage safety andenvironmental regulations. 
  Such new regulations were issued by: (1) the DOGG R, which issued six new safety and reli ability natural gas storage measures in2016 in response to the 2015 Southern Califo
rnia natural gas storage leak in Aliso Canyon; (2) the PHMSA, which issued interim final rules, effective January 18,2017, that addr 
ess pipeline safety issues and mandate certain reporting requirements for operators of underground natural gas storage facilities; and (3) the CPUC,which issued General Order 112-F that b
ecame effective on January 1, 2017, and requires additional expendit ures in the areas of gas l eak repair, leak survey, andhigh consequence area iden
tification, among other things. 
In addition, DOGGR is planning to complete 
its final rulemaking on n ew gas storage safety rules.   The draft rules, that were released for comments on May 19,2017, include a requiremen
t for natural gas storage operators to perform well integrity assessments every two years and to eliminate possibl e single points of failure from natur
al gas storage wells.   The implementation timeframe and requirements under the PHMSA’s proposed regulations currently are being challengedin federal courts. 
  In its application, the Utility proposes a new two-way Gas S torage Balancing Account to add ress uncertainty around the anticipated DOGGRregulations, and also proposes a n
ew memorandum account to track costs related to other anticipated new regulations. 
69
 

 As a result of the existing and 
anticipated gas storage safet y requirements, the Util ity developed and proposed in its 2019 GT&S rate case application a natural gasstorage strategy which inc
ludes the discontinuation (through closure or sale) of operations at two gas storage fields.   The discontinuation is expected to reduce long-term costs for custo
mers and to reduce safety and environmental risks. 
In addition to costs rela
ted to new natural gas storage safety and environmental regulations, the Utility proposed increased infrastructure investments over the 2019to 
2021 period to continue its efforts to improve overall system safety by: (1) making approximately 1,100 miles of transmission pipelines capable of in-lineinspection; (2) perfor
ming in-line inspections of over 2,100 miles of transmission pipeline, or appro ximately one-third of total miles; (3) testing or replacing allpipeline without a test r
ecord (or with a test record that does not meet the Utility’s documentation requirements) by 2027; (4) replacing vintage pipeline for othersafety or reliability issue 
s; and (5) automating valv es in areas where there is a significant potential impact. 
A prehearing conference 
took place on January 4, 2018, and established a procedural schedule.  Testimony will be served near the end of second quarter of 2018and evidenti 
ary hearings, if needed, wil l begin in the third quarter of 2018. As stated above, the Utility expects to file an update of its revenue requirement forecastto reflect the Tax Act by 
the end of March 2018.

On July 29, 2016, the Utility 
filed its TO18 rate case at the FERC request ing a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.7 2 billion, a $387million increase over the 2
016 revenue requirement o f $1.33 billion.  The forecast ed network transmission rate base for 2017 is $6.7 billion.  The Utility is alsoseeking a return on equity of 10.9
%, which includes an incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the C AISO.  In the filing, the Utility for
ecasted that it will make investmen ts of $1.30 billion in 2017 in various capi tal projects.  
On September 30, 2016, the FERC issued an order acc
epting the Utility’s July 2016 filing and set it for hearing, but held the hearing procedures in abeyance forsettlement procedur
es.  The order set an effective date for rates of March 1, 2017, and made the rates subject to refund following resolution of the case.  On March17, 2017, the FERC chief judge issued an order t
ermi nating the settlemen t procedures due to an impasse in the settlement negotiations reported by the parties.  
On August 22, 2017, the FERC trial staff submitted 
testimony.  The table below summarizes the differences between the amount of revenue requiremen t increases included in the Utility’s

January 30, 2018, and an initial decision is expe cted on or before June 1, 2018.  
Also, on March 31, 2017, several of the pa
rties that had already intervened in the TO18 rate case filed a complaint at the FERC, and requested that the complaintbe consolid 
ated with the rate case.   The complaint asserts that the Utility’s revenue requirement request in TO18 is unreasonably high and should be reduced.  The complaint asks that, i
f the outcome of the litigation in TO18 is that the Utility’s revenue requirement should be set at a lower leve l than the revenuerequirement from th
e TO17 settlement, that the FERC order refunds to that lower level determined in TO18 litigation.  On April 20, 2017, the Utility answered thecomplaint, requesting th
at FERC dismiss it. On November 16, 2017, FERC dismissed the c omplaint as the Utility had requested.  On December 18, 2017, thecomplainants filed a 
r equest for rehearing of that orde r, and on January 16, 2018, FERC issued an order granting rehearing for further consideration.  That order does not address the merits o

r the proposed 2 017 revenue req uirement of $1.72 billion. The forecasted n etwork transmission rate base for 2018 is $6.9 billion.  The Utilityis also seeking a 
n ROE of 10.75%, which includes an incent ive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAIS O.  In the filing, the Utility for
ecasted capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion.  On September 28, 2017 , the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s July2017 filing, subject to hear

lication to the CPUC to retire Diablo Canyon at the expiration of its current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025and replace it with a por
tfolio of energy efficiency and GHG-free resources.  The applicati on implements a joint propos al between the Utility and the Friends ofthe Earth, Natural Resources De
fense Council, Environment California, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245, Coalition of California UtilityEmployees, and Alliance 
for Nuclear Responsibility (together, the “Joint Par ties”) .  
On January 
11, 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision in the Ut ility’s proposal to retire Diablo Canyon Uni t 1 by 2024 and Unit 2 by 2025.  The CPUC also:  
deferred considerat
ion of replacement resources to the CPUC’s Integrated Resou rce Planning proceeding;authorized rate re
covery for up to $ 211.3 million (compared with the $352.1 million requested by the Utility) for an em ployee retention program; authorized rate recovery for 
an employee re training program of $11.3 million requested by th e Utility;rejected rate r
ecovery of the proposed $85 million for the community impacts mitigation program on the ground that rate recovery for such a programrequires legislativ
e authorization;authorized 
rate recovery of $18.6 mi llion of the total Diablo Canyon license renewal cost of $53 million and rate recovery of cancelled project costsequal to 100% of direct cos
ts incurred prior to June 30, 2016 , and 25% of direct costs incurred after June 30, 2016, based on a settlement ag reementamong the Utility, the Joint Pa
rties, and certain other parties that the Utility filed with the CPUC in May 2017; andapproved the amortiza
tion of the book value for Diablo Canyon consistent with the Diablo Canyon closure s chedule.  
71
 

 During the year ended Decembe
r 31, 2017, the Utility incurred pre-tax charges of $ 47 million related to the retireme nt of Diablo Canyon including $24 million for cancelled proje
cts and $ 23 million for disallowed license renewal costs.   The Utilit y does not expect to incur addi tional charges as a result of the CPUC’sfinal decision 
, other than additional  project cancellation costs that the Utility does not expect to be material .  
The Joint Parties determ
ined that they will not seek a rehearing on the CPUC final decision.  In accepting the CPUC's decision to retire Diablo Canyon, the Utilitywill withdraw its license r
enewal application at the NRC .  
California

Lands
Lease
 
On June 28, 2016, 
the California State Lands Commission approved a new lands lease for the intake and discharge s tructures at Diablo Canyon to run concurrentlywith Diablo Canyon’s current opera
ting licenses, until Diablo Canyon Unit 2 ceases operations in August 2025.  The Utility believes that the approval of the newlease will ensure sufficient
 time for the Utilit y to identify and bring online a portfolio of GHG-free replacement resources.  The Utility will submit a future leaseextension request to address 
the period of time required for plant decommissioning, which under NRC regulations can take as long as 60 yea rs.  On August 28, 2016, the World Business Academy fil
ed a writ in the Los Angeles Superior Court asserting that the State Lands Commission committed legal error when itdetermined that the sho
rt term lease extension for an existing facility was exempt fr om review under the Californ ia Environmental Quality Act and alleging thatthe State Lands Commission should be r
equired to perform an environmental review of the new lands lease.  The trial took place on July 11, 2017, in Los AngelesSuperior Court and th 
e judge dismissed the peti tion on all grounds, ruling that the State Lands Commission properly determined the short term lease extension wassubject to the existing f
acilities exemption under the California Environmental Quality Act. The World Business Aca demy appealed this decis ion and the matter iscurrently before the Ca
lifornia Court of Appeals in Los Angeles, Second District.  The trial date has not been set.  
Asset
Retirement
Obligations
 
The Utility expects that 
the decommissioning of Diablo Canyo n will take many years af ter the expiration of its current operating licenses.  Detailed studies of thecost to decommission the Uti
lity’s nuclear generation facilities are conducted every three years in conjunction with the NDCTP.  Actual decommissioning costs may vary from these est
imates as a result of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulatory requirements; technology; and costs of labor,materials, and equipm
ent.  The Utility recovers its revenue requirements for decommissioning c osts from customers through a non -bypassable charge that theUtility expects will cont
inue until those costs are fully recovered. 
While the NDCTP forecast includes 
employee severance program estimates, it does not include estimated costs related to the fi nal decision’s employee retention and retraining and develop
ment programs, and the San Luis Obispo County community mitigation program described above.  The Utility intends to conduct a site-specific decommission
ing study to update the 2015 NDCTP forecast and to submit the study to the CPUC by mid-2019.  
The Utility expects to fi
le its 2018 NDCTP application in late 2018 or early 2019.  (See “Asset Retirement Obligations” in Note 2 to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.)
 
CPUC
Cost
of
Capital

On July 13, 2017, the CPUC issued a final decision adopting, wi
th no modifications to it , the PFM filed in February 2017 by San Diego Gas & Electric Company,Southern California Gas Company, Southern Cal
ifornia Edison, the ORA, TURN, and the Utility. 
The final decision extends 
the Utility’s next cost of capital application filing deadline by two years to April 22, 2019, for the year 2020.  The final decision alsoreduces the Utility’s au
thorized ROE from 10.40% to 10.25%, effective January 1, 2018, and resets the Utility’s au thorized cost of long-term debt and preferredstock effective Janua
ry 1, 2018.  In addition, the decision suspends the cost of capital adjustment mechanism to adjust cost of capital for 2018, but allows theadjustment mechanism to o 
perate for 2019 if trigg ered.  If the mechanism is a ctivated for 2019, the Utility’s cost of capital, including its new ROE of 10.25%, willbe adjusted according to th
e ex isting terms of the me chanism.  The Utility’s current capital  structure of 52% common equity, 47% long-term debt, and 1%preferred equity re
mains unchanged. 
The final decision also l
eaves the proceeding open to facilitate gathering of information to inform the next cost of capital proceeding, as well as to provide apossible venue in whi 
ch to consider whether the Uti lity’s ROE should be reduced until any recommendations that the CPUC may adopt in the second phase of itssafety culture investigation
 are implemented, as described in the May 8, 2017 scoping m emo a nd r uling issued in the Safe ty Culture OII.  
72
 

 On September 29, 2017, the Utility submi
tted an advice letter to the CPUC, updating its cost of capital and the estimated revenue requirement impacts with aneffective date of J
anuary 1, 2018.  The long-term debt cost , reset to 4.89%, ref lects actual embedded costs as of the end of August 2017 and forecasted interestrates for the new long-te
rm debt expected to be issued for the remainder of 2017 and all of 2018.  Changes in market interest rates may have material effects on thecost of th 
e Utility’s future fin ancings, but will not affect the authorized cost of capital in 2018.
The Utility 
expects to file its next cost of c apital application in 2019.
Application
to
Establish
a
Wildfire
Expense
Memorandum
Account

On July 26, 2017, the U 
tility filed an appl ication with the CPUC requesting to establish a WEMA to track wildfire expenses and to preserve the opportunity for theUtility to request recov
ery of wildfire costs in excess of insurance at a future date.  Concurrently with this appli cation, the Utility also sub mitted a motion to theCPUC requesting that the WEMA be deemed e
ffective as of July 26, 2017, such that the Utility may begin recording costs to the account while the application ispending before the CPUC. 
 
Under the WEMA as 
proposed, the Utility would record costs related to wildfire s , including: (1) payments to satisfy wildfire claims, including any deductibles,co-insurance and other insu
rance expense paid by the Utility but excluding costs that have already been authorized in the Utility’s GRC; (2) outside l egal costsincurred in the defense o
f wildfire claims; (3) premium costs not in rates; and (4) the cost of financing these amounts. Insurance proceeds, as well as any paymentsreceived from third p
arties, would be credi ted to the WEMA as they are r eceived.  The WEMA would not include the Utility’s costs for fire response andinfrastructure costs whi
ch are tracked in CEMA.  The Utility would be required to file an application to seek approval to recover costs tracked in W EMA.  A prehearing conferenc
e was held on December 8, 2017, and a scoping memo was issued on January 11, 2018.  The Utility filed opening briefs with the CPUC onJanuary 25, 2018 and other parties
’ briefs are expected to be filed in February 2018.  The Uti lity cannot predict th e outcome of this proceeding. 
Catastrophic
Event
Memorandum
Account
Applications
 
The CPUC allows utilities to recover 
the reasonable, incremental costs of responding to catastrophic events through a CEMA.  The CEMA tariff authorize s the utilities to recove
r costs incurred in connection with a catastrophic event that has been declared a disaster o r state of emergency by competent federal or state authorities. 
In 2014 , the CPUC directed the Utility to perform additional fire preventi on and vegetation managem ent work in response to the se vere drought in California.  The costs associ
ated with this work were tracked in the CEMA .  While the Utility bel ieves such costs are recoverable through CEMA, its CEMAapplications 
are subject to CPUC a pproval.  
In 2016, the 
Utility submitted a request to th e CPUC to authorize recovery under the CEMA tariff revenue requirement of approximately $146 million for recorded capital and expense costs 
related to drought mitigation and emergency response activities for declared disaste rs that occurred from D ecember 2012 through March 2016 
.  On January 4 , 2018, ORA, TURN, and the Utility filed an all-par ty motion with the CPUC seeking approval of a settlement agreement these parties have entered into 
.  The settlement agreement proposes that the Utility’s total CEMA tariff revenue requirement request be reduced by $29 million, from $146 million to$117 million. 
  The Utility has requested that these costs be recovered through rates in 2018 and 2019 .  PG&E Corp oration and the Ut ility are unable to predict the outcome of this proce
eding.  
The Utility expects to submi
t its 2018 CEMA application to the CPUC in the second quarter of 2018 .

Plan  
As required by California law, on July 1, 2015, 
the Utility filed its proposed DRP for approval by the CPUC.  The Utility’s plan identifies optimal locations on itselectric distribu
tion system for deployment of DERs.  The Utility’s proposa l is designed to allow energy t echnologies to be integrated into the larger grid whilecontinuing to provide custome
rs with safe, reliable, and affordable electric service.  
73
 

 On February 27, 2017, the CPUC issued a ruling that seeks th
e development of a p rocess for incorporating DER for ecasts into the DRP that takes intoconsideration the coordin
ation with other statewide planning and forecasting processes such as the CEC’s Integrated Energy Policy Report.  This ruling mandatedthe Utility, along with the 
other California IOUs, to develop a draft joint proposal for the CPUC and stakeholder consideration on the process for developing DERforecasts.  On June 9, 2017, the 
IOUs submitted a draft join t proposal for CPUC and stakeholder consideration. The CPUC is sued a PD on December 8, 2017, requiring the IOUs to use the CEC’s DER forecas
t for the 2018-2019 distribution planning cycle.  The Utility has historically used the CEC forecast for planningand will have the opportunity to 
adjust forecasts for EV, photov oltaic , and energy storage during the intermediate years.  The PD also requires the IOUs todevelop an alternate p
lanning forecast scenario in 2018 to establish a method for calculating costs and benefits for DER grid integration to better inform DERsourci 
ng policies.  Workshops to discuss the joint proposal will continue in early 2018 and a final decision is expected from the CPUC by the end of the firstquarter of 2018.
 
On June 30, 2017, the CPUC issued another ruling solicit
ing stakeholder responses on questions set forth in a CPUC staff white p aper on proposing a DIDF.  TheDIDF aims to establish a process fo
r identifying distribution deferral opportunities for DERs.  Stakeholder comments on DIDF were submitted on August 7, 2017,with reply comments sub 
mitted on August 18, 2017. On December 8, 2017, the CPUC issued a PD requiring an annual g rid needs assessment and an annualdistribution deferra
l opportunity report, as part of the annual DRP for greater transparency on infrastructure investments. The g rid needs assessment repor t will identify critica
l overload areas on the grid.  The distribution deferral opportunity report will document the Utility’s proposed distribution needs and identify DER deferral opportuniti
es to be reviewed by the Distribution Planning Advisory Group for prioritiz ing DER deferral projects.   The PD proposes to adopt theregulatory incentive 
mechanism being piloted in the Integrated Distributed Energy Resources Proceeding where the Utility can earn a 4% pre-tax incentive on thean 
nual payments for DER deferral contracts.  The Utility expects a fin al decision from the CPUC in the first quarter of 2018.

On April 4, 2016, the CPUC issued a 
ruling proposing to establish, on a p ilot basis, an interim program offering regulatory incentives to the Utility and the othertwo large California IOUs for th
e deployment of cost-effective DERs.  The ruling stated that it did not intend for this phase to adopt a new regulatory fra mework orbusiness model for the Califo
rnia electric utilities.  On December 22, 2016, the CPUC issued a final decision in the proceeding which authorizes a pilot to test aregulatory incentive 
mechanism through which the Utility will earn a 4% pre-tax incentive on annual payments for DERs, as well as test a regulatory process thatwill allow the Utility to co
mpetitively solicit DER services to defer distribution infrastructure.  Each IOU is required to conduct at least one pilot, but may conduct up to three additional pi
lots. 
In June 2017, the Utility submitt
ed a pilot project proposal to the CPUC for approval to begin solicitations.  The pilot aims to evaluate the effectiveness of anearnings opportunity in motiv 
ating utilities to source DERs.  On October 27, 2017, the CPUC issued a draft resolution that proposed modifications to the Utility’spilot program. 
On December 14, 2017, the CPUC granted the Utility’s November 20, 2017 request to cancel the current pilot project proposa l due to the damage of the Utility’s faci
lities in the area of the Northern California wildfires and propose a new pilot program location by May 1, 2018.

The award was fully offset by a portion of the remain ing reduction approved in the settlement agreement related to the re hearing o f the 2006 – 2008 
risk/reward incentive mechanism.  The settlement agreement requires  the Utility to reduce future energy efficiency shareholder incentives by a total of $29.1million, 
of which $5.8 million was used to offse t the 2014 – 2015 award.  The re maining settlement reduction of $1.3 million will be offset against future energysaving performance 
incentive awards.  
LEGISLATIVE
AND
REGULATORY
IN
ITIATIVES 
The California Legislatu
re and the CPUC have adopted requirements, policies , and decisions to implement new state l aw requirements applicable to natural gasstorage facilities 
, accommodate the growth in distributed electric generation resources (including solar installations), increase the amount of renewable energydelivered to customers, 
improve fire safety regula tions, and foster the development of  a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure to encourage the use ofelectric vehicles. 
  In addition, the CPUC continues to implement state law requirements to reform electric rates to more cl osely reflect the utilities’ actual c osts ofservice, 
and reduce cross-subsidizat ion among customer rate classes .   CPUC proceedings related to some of these matters are discussed below. 
 
74
 

  
The Utility’s ability to 
recover its costs, including investments as sociated with legislative a nd regulatory initiatives, as well as its electricity procurement and otheroperating costs, will, in la
rge part, depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanism s can be timely adjusted to reflect chan
ges in customer demand for the Utility’s electricity and natural gas service.

OIR
 
On April 25, 2017, the Utility, along with Southern Ca
lifornia Edison Company and San Diego Gas & Electric Company, fil ed a joint application with the CPUCon how to allocate costs associ
ated with long-term power commitments in a manner that ensures all customers are treated equally.  At issue is how customerswithin communities that 
choose to i mplement CCA power arrangements and those served under direct access pay for their share of the costs.  The utilities believethat these customers a
re not paying their full share of costs associated with the long-term commitments, which results in other cu stomers paying more, which is inconsistent with state l
aw.  The Utility is committed to helping create a cost allocation method that treats all customers fairly and equally, whether they continueto receive service 
from the Utility or choose a CCA or direc t access provider.  The Util i ty projects that more than half of its customers will purch ase electricityfrom a CCA or direct access prov
ider by 2020.  Without changes to the current cost allocation system, a portion of the contract and facilities costs wil l be shifted to customers who remain with th
e Utility or live in areas that do not have access to alternative electricity providers.  The utilities’ joint proposed approach wouldreplace the curren
t system, which is known as the PCIA, with an updated syste m known as the Portfolio Allocation M ethodology. 
On June 29, 2017, the CPUC dismissed the Utility’s joint Por
tfolio Allocation Methodology application without prejudice and instead approved an OIR to review,revise, and consider alt
ernatives to the PCIA.   The OIR will focus on PCIA within the larger con text of consumer choice in energy services, and should not beconsidered a follow-up to the CPUC and Energy Comm
ission Joint En Banc on Customer Choice in California.  On September 25, 2017, the CPUC issued a scoping memo and ruling estab
lishing a procedural schedule and a new overall goal to mitigate cost increases for both bundled and departing load customers. Testimony is scheduled for th
e first quarter of 2018.  Evidentiary hearings , if needed, are sche duled for the second quarte r of 2018 and a proposed decision isexpected by the third quar
ter of 2018. 
Customer
Choice

On May 19, 2017, California energy compan
ies, along with other stakeholders discussed customer choice and the future of Ca lifornia’s el ectric industry at a CPUC “en banc” meeting.  Specifica
lly, the goal of the meeting was to frame a discussion on the trends that are driving change within California’s electricitysector and overall cl
ean-energy economy and to lay out elements of a path fo rward to ensure that California achieves its reliability, affordability, equity, andcarbon reduction imper
atives while recognizing the important role that technology and customer preferences will play in shaping this future.  
On October 11, 2017, the CP 
UC announced the formation of the Ca lifornia Customer Choice Project to examine the issues and produce a report evaluatingregulatory framework opt
ions in early 2018.  The CPUC held an informal public workshop on October 31 ,
 2017 , to gather stakeholder inp ut on global and national electric market choice model
s, including California’s 2020 market.  The project may produce a white paper that will provide a framework to evaluatecustomer choice models b
ased on affordability, decarbonization, and reliability.  The white paper will not presen t a recommendation nor is it intended to providethe basis for instituting 
a rulemaking .  While the CPUC had indicated its in tent to open a proceeding related to customer choice, the Utility is unable to predictwhether that 
remains the CPUC’s intent or the t iming of any such proceeding.

Development 
In December 2014, the CPUC issued a decision adop
ting a policy to expand the California utilities’ role in developing EV charging infrastructure to support California’s clima
te goals.  On February 9, 2015, the Utility filed an application requesting that the CPUC approve the Utility’s proposal to deploy, own, andmaintain EV charging stat
ions and the associated infras tructure.  On De cember 15, 2016, the CPUC issued a fina l decision establishing a three-y ear EV programof 
$130 million (approximately $109 million in capital expenditures) to deploy up to 7,500 charging stations.  Further deployment of light-duty EV infrastructurewill be 
considered in a second phase of the proceeding. 
Tra

(TE) 
California Law (S 
B 350) requires the CPUC, in consultation with the CARB and the CEC, to direct electrical corporations to file applications for programs andinvestment 
s to accelerate widesp read TE.  In September 2016, the CPUC directed the Utility and the other large IOUs to file TE applications which include bothshort-term projects 
(of up to $20 million in total) and two- to five-year programs with a requested revenue requirement deter mined by the Utility.  On January 20,2017, the Utility filed its TE 
application with the CPUC requesting a total of up to $253 million (approximately $211 million in capital expenditures) in programfunding over five years (2018 - 2022
) related to make-r eady infrastructure for TE in medium to heavy-duty vehicle sectors, fast charging stations, and short-termprojects which includes a se
ries of TE demonstratio n projects and pilot progra ms.  On January 11 , 201 8 , the CPUC approved , with modi fications, four out of the five short-term p
rojects proposed by the Utility for a total of approxim ately $8 million.  The CPUC may issue a proposed decision o n the make-ready infrastructure proposa
ls in the first or second quarter of 2018. 
Fire
Safety
OIR 
On December 14, 2017, the CPUC approved new regulations to 
enhance the fire safety of overhead electric transmission and distribution lines located in high fire-threat areas.  This is th
e culmination of a decade-long effort to improve the fire safety of overhead utility and com munication infrastructure across California.  TheSED conferred with Cal Fire, Californ
ia IOUs, and fire safety professionals, to develop and adopt a statewide fire-threat map.  This map, in conjunction with aUnited States Forest Ser 
vice and Cal Fire map of tr ee mortality high hazard zones, will dictate the application of the new fire safety regulations. On January 19, 2018, the CPUC approved the final fire sa
fety map associated with the new regulations. 
The new regulations include 
increased patrol frequency f or overhead facilities , expanded vegetation clearances around powerlines , and give the utilities increased authority to de-energize line
s on private property for the removal of trees that pose an immediate threat to fire safety .  The costs associated with the implementation of th
ese new regulations will be tracked in a fire hazard prevention memorandum account and requested for recovery through rates. 
ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS
  
The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health ofthe Utility’s personnel and 
the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad  range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardouswastes; the reporting and r
eduction of CO 2 and other GHG emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting of safety and reliability measures for natural gas 
storage facilities; and the transportation, hand ling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors , “Environmental Regulation
” in Item 1 . and “Environmental Remediation Contingencies” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial State ments in Item 8 
.) 
RISK
MANAGEMENT
ACTIVITIES
 
PG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownersh
ip of the Utility, and the Utility are exposed to risks associated with advers e changes in commodity prices, interestrates, and counterparty 
credit. 
The Utility actively m
anages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourage unauthorized risk-taking, re duce commodity cost volatil
ity, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non- trading purposes ( i.e . risk mitigation) and not for speculative purposes 
.  The Utility’s risk manage ment activities include the use of physical and financial instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps,options, and other instruments 
and agreements, most of which are accounted for as derivative instruments.  Some contracts are accounted for as leases. 
76
 

 Commodity
Price
Risk  
The Utility is 
exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas andnuclear fuel necessa
ry for electricity generation and natural gas procurement for core customers.  As long a s the Utility can conclude that it is probable that itsreasonably incurred w
holesale electricity procurement costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and natural gas prices will not affectearnings 
. Such fluctuations, howe ver, may impact cash flows.   The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core customers are also fullyrecoverable through a r
atemaking mechanism.  
The Utility’s current au
thorized revenue requirement for natural gas transportation and storage service to non-co re customers is not balancing account protected.  The Utility recovers thes
e costs in its gas transmission and storage rate cases through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts,resulting in pric 
e and volumetric risk.  The Utility uses value-at -risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks.  The Utility’s va lue-at-risk was approximately 
$ 8 million and $7 million at December 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively .  During 2017 , t he Utility’s approximate high, low, and average values- at-risk 
were $8 million, $7 million and $7 million, respectively. During 2016 , the value-at-risk a mounts were $7 million, $1 million and $4 million, respectively . ( 
See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of pr ice risk management activities.) 
Interest
Rate
Risk
 
Interest rate risk s
ensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in marketinterest rates.  A 
t December 31 , 2017 and 2016 , if interest rates changed by 1% for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term debt, short-termdebt, and cash investments 
, th e impact on net income over the next 12 months would be $ 12 million and $13 million, respectively, based on net variable ra te debtand other interest ra
te-sensitive instruments outstanding.   ( See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further d iscussion ofinterest rates 
.)  
Energy
Procurement
Credit
Ris
 k 
The Utility conducts business with coun
terparties mainly in the energy industry, including the CAISO market, other California investor- owned electric utilities,municipal utiliti
es, energy trading companies, financial institutions, electricity generatio n companies, and oil and natural gas produc tion companies located in theUnited States and Canada.  If a coun
terparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas, then the Utility may find it necessary toprocure electricit 
y or gas at current mark et prices, which may be higher than the contract prices. 
The Utility manages cred
it risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, creditratings, a 
nd other credit criteria as deeme d appropriate.  Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically.  The Utility executes many energy contracts under 
master commodity enabling a greements that may require security (referred to as “Credit Collatera l” in the table below).  Cred it c ollateral may be in theform of cash or letters of
 credit.  The Utility may accept other forms of performance assurance in the form of corporate guarantees of acceptable credit quality orother eligible secur
ities (as deeme d appropriate by the Utili ty).  Credit c ollateral or performance assurance may be required from counterparties when current netreceivables and replacement cost
 exposure exceed contractually specified limits.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING
POL
ICIES

The preparation of 
the Conso lidated Financial Stat ements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estima tes and assumptions that affect the recordedamounts of assets and liabi
lities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses durin g the reporting period.  The accounting policies desc
ribed below are considered to be critical accounting policies due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant andmaterial to the f
inancial position and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and b ecause these policies require the use of material judgmentsand estimates.  Actual r
esults may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions .  These accounting policies and their key c haracteristics are ou tlined below.
 
Regulatory
Accounting  
As a regulated entity, 
t he Utility records regulatory assets  and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probab le of recovery from, or refund to, customers.  Theseamounts would otherwise be record
ed to expense or income under GAAP.  Refer to “Regulation and Regu lated Operations” in Note 2 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financia
l Statements in Item 8.  At December 31, 2017 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility repo rted regulato ry assets (including curr entregulatory balancing a
ccounts receivable) of $ 5 .6 billion and regulatory liabilities (incl uding current regulatory balancing accounts payabl e) of $9.9 billion .  
Determining probability 
requires signifi cant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatoryhearings, proposed regulatory d
ecisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court ap peals.  For some of the Utility’s regulatory ass
ets, including utility retained generation , the Utility has determ ined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from the CPUC 
.  The Utility also records a regulatory asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current e xpenditures and historical experience indicates that recoveryof incurred costs is probabl
e, such as the r egulatory assets for pension benefits ; deferred income tax; price risk management; and unamortized loss, net of gain, onreacquired debt.  The CPUC has not denied th
e recovery of any material costs previously recognized by the Utility as regulatory assets for the periods presented.  If the Utility determined 
that it is no longer probable th at regulatory assets would be reco vered or reflected in future rates, or if the Utility ceas ed to be subject to rate regulation, the 
regulatory assets would be charged against income in the period in which that determination was made.   I f regulatory accounting did notapply, the Utility’s 
future financial results coul d become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the differences in the timing of expense orrevenue recognition.
 
In addition, regulatory a
ccounting standards require recognition of a   loss if it beco mes probable that capi tal expenditures will be disallowed for ratemakingpurposes and if a reasonable 
estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments require significant judgment by management regardingprobability of recovery, 
as described above, and the ult imate cost of construction of capital assets. The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are expectedto exceed the amount to be 
recovered.   The Utility records a provision based on its best estimate; to the extent t here is a high degree of unc ertainty in the Utility’sforecast, it will re
cord a provision based on the lower end of the range of possible losses.   The Utility’s capital forecasts involve a series of complex judgmentsregarding detailed pro
ject plans, esti mates included in third-part y contracts, historical cost experience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmentalcompliance standards, and 
a variety of other factors.   
In 2017, t 
he Utility recorded cha rges of $47 million for capita l expenditures related to cancelled projects and disallowed license renewal costs as part of the DiabloCanyon settlement agree
ment.  In 2016, the Utility incurred charges of $283 million and $219 million for capital spending that wa s disallowed related to th e SanBruno Penalty Decision and for capi
tal expenditures disallowed based on the final phase two decision in its 2015 GT&S rate case, respectively.  In 2015, theUtility incurred charg
es of $407 million for capital spending that were disallowed related to the San Bruno Penalty Decision.  The Utility would be required torecord charges in futur
e periods to the extent there are additional capital disallowances.  (See “ Enforcement and Litigation Matters ” in Note 1 3 of the Notes to th e 
Consolidated F inancial Statements in Item 8.)

 Loss
Contingencies

As discussed below, PG&E Corporation and t 
he Utility have recorded  material accruals for various enforcement and legal matters and enviro nmental remediation liabilities.  PG& 
E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded insurance receivables for third-party claims. 
Enforcement
and
Litigation
Matters
 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are name d as parties in a number of claimsand lawsuits.  In addition, penal
ties may be incurred for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations.  PG&E Corporation and the Utilityrecord a provision for a loss 
contingency when it is both p robable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG&ECorporation and the Utility ev
aluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount w ithin the range is a better 
estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss isestimable, often involv
es a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies are reviewed  quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect theimpact of all known inform
ation, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and eventspertaining to a pa 
rticular matte r.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs, which are expensed asincurred.  Actual results 
may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.  (See “Enforcement and Litig ation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.) 
Environmental
Remediation
Liabiliti
es
The Utility is subject to loss 
contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regulations that in t he future may require the Utility to payfor environmental re
mediation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party.  Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardoussubstances at various potent
ial sites, including f ormer manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility fo r thestorage, recycling, or dispos
al of potentially hazardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site. 
The 
Utility generally commences the environmental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a potentialsite requiring remedial action.
  (In some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determi ne its remediation l iability for sites that it no longer owns incooperation with regulato
ry agencies.  For example, the Utility has begun a program related to certain former manufactured gas plant sites.)  Based on such notification, the Util
ity completes an assessment of the potential site and evaluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred.  The Utilityrecords an environmenta
l remediation liability when site assessments indicate remediation is probable and it can reasonab ly estimate the loss or a range of possiblelosses 
.  Given the complexities of the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, theprocess for estimating remediati
on liabilities is subjective and requires s ignificant judgment.  Key factors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extentand types of hazardous substances 
at a potential site, the range of technologies that can be used for remediation, the determination of the Utility’s liability in proportion to other responsibl
e parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. 
When possible, the Utility es
timates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience f or costs incurred at sim ilar sites depending onthe level of informa
tion available.  Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees who areexpected to devote a signi
ficant amount of t ime directly to the remediation eff ort.  These estimated costs include remedial site investigations, remediation actions,operations and maintenan
ce activities, post remediation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site. Remediation efforts fo
r a particular site generally extend over a period of several years.  During this period, the laws governing the remediation process maychange, 
as well as site conditions, thereby possibly affect ing the cost of t he remediation effort.  
79
 

 At December 31, 
2017 and 2016 , the Utility ’s accruals for undiscount ed gross environmental liab ilities were $ 1 b illion and $ 958 million, respectively.  The Utility’s undiscounted futur
e costs c ould increase to as much as $ 2.1 billion if the extent of contaminatio n or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or if the other potentia
lly responsible parties are not financially able to contribute to these costs, and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyondregulatory requirem
ents.  Although the Utility has provided for known environmenta l obligations that are pr obable and reasonably estimable, estimated costs mayvary significantly fro
m actual costs, and the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.  
Insurance
Receivable 
The Utility has liability 
  insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third party claims.  The Utility records insurance recoveries only when athird party claim is recorded
 and it is deemed probable that a recovery of that claim will occur and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.    The assessment of whether re
covery is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the recovery or a range of recoveries is estimable, often involves a series ofcomplex ju 
dgments about future events.     Insurance recoveries are reviewed quarterly   and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact   of all known information,including contractual 
liability insurance policy coverage, advice of legal counsel, past experience with si milar events, discussions with insurers and other information and events 
pertaining to a particular matter.   (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13   of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.)

Asset
Retirement
Obligation
s 
PG&E Corporation and the 
Utility account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable esti mate of fair valueand its settlement date 
can be made.  At the time of recording an ARO, the associated as set retirement costs are capitalized a s part of the carrying amount of therelated long-lived asset.  
The Utility recognize s a regulatory asset or liabilit y for the timing differences b etween the recognition of expenses and costs recovered through the rate 
making process.   (See Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
To estimate 
its liability, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant est imates and assumptions abou t future decommissioning costs,inflation rates, and the e
stimated date of decommissioning.  The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects therisk associated with the de
commissioning obligation.  
At December 31, 
2017 , the Utility’s recorded ARO for th e estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was $ 4.9 billion .   Changes in these estimates and assumptions 
could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for thes e assets. 
Pension
and
Other
Postretirement
Benefit
 Plans 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
sponsor a non-contributory defined b enefit pension plan for eligible emplo yees a s well as contributory postretirement health care and 
medical plans for eligible r etirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and retirees 
.   Adjustments to the pension and oth er benefit obligation are based on the d ifferences between a ctuarial assumptions and actual plan results .  These amounts are 
deferred in accumulated other c omprehensive income (loss) and amortized into income on a gradual basis.   The differences between pe nsion benefit expense 
recognized in accordan ce with GAAP and amounts recognized for ratem aking purposes are recorded as regulatory asset s or liabilit ies as amounts areprobable of recovery fro
m customers.   To the extent the other ben efits are in an overfun ded position, the Utility re cords a regulatory liability.   (See Note 3 of theNotes to the Consolidated Financia
l Statements in Item 8.)  
The pension and 
other postretirement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date.  The significant a ctuarial assumptions used in determin
ing pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the health carecost tre 
nd rate and the expected return on plan assets.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them asnecessary 
.  While PG&E Corporation and the Util ity believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significa nt differences in actual experie nce, plan changesor amendments, 
or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the recorded pension and other postretirement benefit oblig ations and future plan expenses. 
 
I 
n establishing health care cost ass umptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider rec ent cost trends and projections from industry experts .  This evaluation suggests that cu
rrent rates of inflation are expected to continue in the near term.  In recognition of continued high inflation i n health care costs and given the design of PG&E Corporation’s pl
ans, the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2018 is 6.8 % , gradually decreasing to the u ltimate trend rate of 4.5 %in 
2027 and beyond .  
 
80 

 Expected rates of retu
rn on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then apply ing these returns to the target asset allocations ofthe employee benefit 
trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Fixed - income returns were projected based on real maturity and creditsp 
reads added to a long-term inflat ion rate.  Equity returns wer e projected based on estimates of divid end yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term rateof inflation.  For the Utili
ty’s defined benefit pension plan, the assumed return of 6.2 % compares to a ten-year actual return of 7.8 % . 
The rate used to discount pension b
enefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of approximately 623 Aa-grade non-callablebonds at December 31, 
2017 .  This yield curve has discount r ates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated futu re cash flows for the pension and other postretir
ement benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate. 
The following reflects th
e sensitivity of pension costs and projected benefit obligation to changes in ce rtain actuarial assumptions:

NOTE
1:
ORGANIZATION
AND
BASIS
OF
PRESENTATION  
PG&E Corporation is a holding company 
whose primary operating subsidi ary is Pacific Gas and Electri c Company, a public utility serving northern and central California.  The Utility gen
erates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of el ectricity and natur al gas to customers.  The Utility is primarily regulated by the CPUC and the FERC.  In addition, the NRC oversees the licens
ing, construction, operation, and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.  
This is a co 
mbined annual report of PG&E Corpora tion and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation’s C onsolidated F inancial S tatements include the accounts of PG&ECorporation, the Utility, and oth
er wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.  The Utility’s Consolidated F inancial S tatements include the accounts of the Utilityand its wholly owned and controlled subsid
iaries.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   The Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements apply to both PG&E Corporat
i on and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess financial performance and allocate re sources on aconsolidated basis (i.e., th
e companies operate in one segment).  
The 
accompanying C onsolidated F inancial S tatements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the reporting requirements of Form 10-K.  The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP require s the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev 
enues and expenses and the disclosu re of contingent assets and liabilitie s.  Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to theUtility’s 
regulatory assets and li abilities, legal and regulatory contingencies, environmental remediation lia bilities, ARO s, and pension and other postreti rementbenefit plans obligations.  M
anagement believes that its estimates and assumptions reflected in the C onsolidated F inancial S tatements are appropriate andreasonable.  
A change in management’s es timates o r assumptions could result in an adjustment that could have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition and results of operations and cash flows during the period in which such change occurred. 
Beginning on October 8, 20 
17, multiple wildfires spr ead through Northern California, includ ing Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humbold t, Mendocino, Del Norte , Lake,Nevada, and Yuba Counties, as well as in the 
area surrounding Y uba City (the “Northern California wildfires ”).  According to the Cal Fire California Statewide Fire Summary dated October 30, 2017, a
t the peak of the wildfires, there were 21 major wildfires in California that, in total,   burned over 245,000 acres, resultedin 43 fatalities, and des
troyed an estimated 8,900 structu res.   Subsequently, the number of fat alities increased to 44.  The fires are being inves tigated by Cal Fireand the CPUC, including the possible role of 
the Utility’s power lines and other facilities.   See “Northern California Wildfires” in Note 13 below.  
NOTE

SUMMARY
OF
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUN
TING
POLICIES

Regulation
and
Regulated
Operations
 
The Utility follows accounting p
rinciples for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “re venue requirements” that have been authorizedby 
the CPUC or the FERC based on the Utility’s cost of providing service.  The Utility also records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemakingprocess that would not be record
ed under GAAP for nonregulated entities.  The Utility capitali zes and records as regula tory assets, costs that would otherwise becharged to expense if it 
is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.  Regulatory assets are amortized over the future periods in which the costs are recovered.  
If costs expected to be in curred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Utility records those expected future costs asregulatory liabilities.  
A mounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers in the future are a lso recorded as regulatory liabilities. 
Management continues to be
lieve the use of regulatory accounting is applicable a nd that all regulatory assets and liabilitie s are recoverable or refundable.  To the extent that portions of th
e Utility’s operations c ease to be subject to cost of service rate regulation, or recovery is no longer probable as a result of changes inregulation or other re
asons, the related regulatory assets and liabilities are written off.

Revenue
Recognition
 
The Utility 
recognizes revenues when electricity and natural gas ser vices are delivered .   The Utility records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energydelivered to customers bu
t not yet billed at the end of the period.  Unbilled revenues are included in accounts rece ivable on the Consolidated Balan ce Sheets.  Rates charged to customers 
are based on CPUC and FERC authorized revenue requirements. 
The CPUC authorizes most of the Utility
’s revenues in the Utility’s GRC and its GT&S rate cases, which generally occur every three or four years.   T he Utility’sability to recover r 
evenue requirements au thorized by the CPUC in these rates cases is independent, or “decoupled” from the volume of the Utility’s sales ofelectricity and na
tural gas services.   The U tility recognizes revenues that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable ofrecovery, and are expec
ted to be collected within 24 months.   Generally, revenue is recognized ratably over the year.   The Utility records a bal an cing account asset or liability fo
r differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that are probable of recovery or refund.   
The CPUC also has authorized the Utility 
to collect additional revenue requirements to recover costs t hat the Utility has been authorized to pass on to cus tomers,including costs to purchase e
lectricity and natural gas; and to fund public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs.   In general , the revenue recognition cr
iteria for pa ss-through costs billed to custo mers are met at the time the costs are incurred.   The Utility records a regulatory balancingaccount asset or liability f
or differences between incurred costs and custome r billings or authorized revenue meant to recover thos e costs , t o the extent that thesedifferences are prob
able of recovery or refund .  These differences have no impact on net income.   
The FERC authorizes the Utility’s r
evenue requirements in periodic (often annual) TO rate cases.   The Utility’s ability t o recover revenue requirements authorized by the FERC is dependent on the vo
lume of the Utility’s electricity sales, and revenue is recognized only for amounts billed and unbilled , net of revenues subject to refund 
.  
C
ash
and
Cash
Equivalents 
Cash and cas 
h equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated atfair value. 
 
Allowance
for
Doubtful
Accounts
Receivable

PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cognize an allowance for doubtful a ccounts to record uncollectable customer accounts receivable at estimated net realizablevalue.  The allowance is det
ermined based upon a variety of factors, including historical write-off experience, aging of receivables , curren t economic conditions, and assessment of customer 
collectability. 
Inventories

Inventories are carried at 
weighted- average cost and include natural gas stored underground as well as materials and supplies .   Natural gas stored underground is recorded to 
inventory when injected and then expensed as the gas is withdrawn for distribut ion to customers or to be used as fuel for electric generation.  Materials and supplies are 
recorded to inventory when purchased and expens ed or capitalized to plant, as appropr iate, when consumed or instal led. 
Emission
Allowances
 
The Utility purchases GHG emission al
lowances to satisfy its compliance obligations.  Associated costs are recorded as inventory and included in current assets –other and other noncurrent 
assets – ot her on the Consolidated Balance She ets.  Costs are carried at weighted-average and are recoverable through rates. 
101
 

 Property,
Plant,
and
Equipment
 
Property, plant, and equipment 
are reported at the lower of their historical cost less accumulated depreciat ion or fair value .  Historical costs include labor and materials, construc
tion overhead, and AFUDC.  (See “AFUDC” below.)  The Utility’s total estimated useful liv es and balances of its property, plant, andequipment were as follows:

Balance includes nuclear fuel inventories.  Stored nuclear fuel inventory  is stated at weighted- average  cost.  Nuclear fuel  in the reactor is expensed as  used based on the amount of energyoutput.  (See Note 
13 below.) 
The Utility depreciat
es property, plant, and equipment using the composite, or group, method of depreciation, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to thegross investment 
balance in a particular cl ass of property.  This method approximates the straight line method of depreciation over the useful lives of property,plant, and equipment.  The Util
ity’s co mposite depreciatio n rates were 3.83 % in 2017 , 3.73% in 2016 , and 3.80 % in 2015 .   The useful lives of the Utility’sproperty, 
plant, and equipment are authorized by the CPUC and the FERC, and the depreciation expense is recovered through rates charged to customers. Depreciation expense inc
ludes a component for the original cost of assets and a component for estimated cost of fut ure removal, net of any sa lvage value atretirement.  Upon reti
rement, the original cost of the retired assets, net of salvage value, is charged against accumulated depreciation.  The cost of repairs andmaintenance, including pla
nned major maintenance act ivities and minor repl acements of property, is charged to operating and maintenance expense as incurred. 
AFUDC
 
AFUDC 
represents the estimated cost s of debt (i.e., interest) and equity funds used to finance regulated plant additions before they go into servic e and is capitalized as par
t of the cost of construction.  AFUDC is recoverable from customers through rates over the life of the related property once the property is placedin service.  AFUDC related to the cost o
f debt is recor ded as a reduction to inte rest expense.  AFUDC related to the cost of equity is recorded in other income. The Utility recorded AFUDC 
related to debt and equi ty, respectively, of $ 38 million and $ 89 mil lion during 2017, $ 51 million and $ 112 million during 2016 , and 
$ 48 million and $107 million during 2015.

al settlement dates for these assets , reasonable estimate s of fair value cannot be made.  As such, ARO liabilities are not re corded forretirement activitie 
s associated with substations, photovoltaic facilities, and certain hydroelectric facilities; removal of lead-based paint in some facilities andcertain communications equipme
nt from leased property; and restoration o f land to specified conditions under ce rtain agreements.

 Nuclear
Decommissioning
Obligation
 
Detailed studies of the cos
t to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities are conducted every three years in conjunction with the NDCT P.  On May 25, 2017, the CPUC issued a final decision in the 2015 NDCTP adopting a nu
clear decommissioning cost estimate of $1.1 billion for Humboldt Bay,corresponding to the Utility
’s request, and $2.4 billion for Diablo Canyon, representing 64% of the U tility’s request of $3.8 billion.  On an aggregate basis, thefinal decision adopted a $3.5 b
illion total nuclear decommissioning cost estimate, compared to $4.8 billion requested by the Utility.  Compared to the Utility’sestimated cost to deco
mmission Di ablo Canyon, the final decision adopts assumptions which lower costs for large component removal, site security,decommissioning contrac
tor staff, spent nuclear fuel storage, and waste disposal.  The Utility can seek recovery of these costs in the 2018 NDC TP.  The CPUC’s final decision result
ed in a $66 mill ion reduction to the ARO on the Consolidated Balance Sheets re lated to the assumed length of the wet cooling period of spentnuclear fuel afte
r plant shut down. 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
corded an increase of $92 mill ion to the ARO recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, to align the decommissioningcost estimate with the CPUC’s fina
l decision on the Utility’s application to retire Diablo Canyon Unit 1 by 2024 and Unit 2 by 2025. 
The es 
timated nuclear de commissioning cost is discounted for GAAP purposes and recognized as an ARO on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   The total nuclear decommissioning obligation 
accrued was $ 3.5 billion at both December 31, 2017 and 2016 .   The estimated undiscounted nuclear decommissioning cost for theUtility’s nuclear power pl
ants was $ 4.1 billion at December 31, 2017 (or $ 7 billion in future dollars).  These estimates are b ased on the 2017 decommissioning cost studies, prepared in a
ccordance with CPUC requirements. 
Disallowance
of
Plant
Costs
 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently comple ted plant will not berecoverable through ra
tes charged to customers and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note13 
below.) 
Nuclear
Decommissio
ning
Trusts 
The Utility’s nuclear 
generation facilities consist o f two units at Diablo Canyon and one retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires thesafe removal of 
a nuclear generation facilit y from service and the reduction of r esidual radioactivi ty to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of the proper
ty for unrestricted use.  The Utility's nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered from customers through rates and are held in trusts untilauthorized f 
or release by the CPUC .  
The Utility classifies 
its investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trust s as “available-for-sale.”  Since the Utility’s nuclear d ecommissioning trust assetsare managed by externa
l inve stment managers, the Uti lity does not have the ability to sell its investments at its discretion.  Therefore, all unrealized losses areconsidered other-than-
temporary impairments.  Gains or losses on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments are refun dable or recoverable, respectively, fromcustomers 
through rates.   Therefore, trust earnings are deferred and included in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of the ARO.  There is no impact onthe Utility’s earnings 
or accumulated other compr ehensive income.  The cost of debt and equity securiti es sold by the trust is determined by specif ic identification. 
Variable
Interest
Entities
 
A VIE is an entity that does not have su
fficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional s ubordinated financial suppo rt from other parties, or whoseequity investors lack a
ny characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is a primary beneficiaryand is required to consolid 
ate the VIE.  
103
 

 Some of the counterparti
es to the Utility’s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power pl ant that wouldgenerate electricity for sale to the
 Utility.  To determine whether the Utility was the primary beneficiary of any of these VIE s at December 31, 2017, it assessed whether it absorbs any of the VIE’s 
expected losses or receives any portion of the VIE’s expected residual returns under the terms of the power purchase agreement , analyzed 
the variability in the VIE’s gross margin , and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities that are mostsignificant to the VIE’s pe
rformance, such as dispatch rights and operating and maintenance activities.  T he Utilit y’s financial obligation is limited to the amount the Utility 
pays for delivered ele ctricity and capacity.  The Utility did not have any decision-making rights associated with any of the activities that are mostsignificant to the econo
mic performance of a ny of these VIEs .  Since the Utility was not the prim ary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2017 , itdid not consolidate any of 
them .

In 
March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation
–
Retirement
Benefits
(Topi c
715)
, which amends the existing guidan ce relating to the presentationof net periodic pension cost 
and net periodic other pos t-retirement benefit costs .   On a retrospective basis, the amendment requ ires an employer to separate theservice cost component f
rom the other components of net benefit cost and provides explicit guidance on how to present the service cost component and othercomponents in the income st
atement.   In add ition, on a prospective basis, the ASU limits the component of net benefit cost eligible to be capitalized to servicecosts. 
  The ASU became effective for PG&E Corporat ion and the Utility on January 1, 2018 .   The FERC has allowed and the Utility has made a one-time election to adopt the new FASB guidance fo
r regulatory filing purposes.   In January 2018 , the CPUC approved modifications to the Utility’s calculation for pension-related revenu
e requirements to allow for capitalization of only the service cost c omponent determined by a pl an’s actuaries.     The change incapitalization of retirement benefits 
will not have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consol idated Financial Statements .

 , which amends the existing guidan ce relating to the definition of a lease, recognition oflease assets and lease 
liabilities on the balance sheet, and the disclosure of key information a bout leasing arrangemen ts.   In November, 2017, the FASB tentativelydecided to amend the new le
asing guidance such that entities may elect not to restate their comparative periods in the period of adoption.  Under the new standard, all lessees must recogni 
ze an asset and liabil ity on the balance sheet.  Operating leases were previously not recognized on the balance sheet.   The ASU will beeffective for PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility plan to adopt th is guidancein the 
first q uarter of 2019.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect this standard to increase lease assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and do not expect 
the guidance will have a materi al impact on the Consolidated Statements o f Income, Statements of Cash Flows and lease disclosures.

In connection with the settlement agreement entered into among PG &E  Corporation, the Utility, and the CPUC in 2003 to resolve the Utility’s proceeding under Chapter 11, the CPUCauthorized
 the Utility to recover $ 1.2 billion of costs related to the Utility’s retained generation assets.  The individual components of thes e  regulatory assets are being amortized over therespective lives of the underlying generation facilities, consistent wi
th the period over which the related revenues are recognized. ( 
3 ) Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annu al  contribution requirements. As these annual requirements continue indefinitely into the future, t he  Utility expects tocontinuously recover pension benefits.
( 
4 ) The change in the balance from a regulatory asset as of December 31, 2016 to a regulatory li ability  as of December 31, 2017 reflects the impact of changes in net deferred tax liabilitiesassociated with a lower federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Act.  (See “Regulatory Liabilities” be
low and Note 8.) 
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, other long-t
erm regulatory assets included $274 million and $70 million, respectively, of costs related to CEMA events from2014 through 2017 that the Utility be
lieves are recoverable based on historical experience in recover ing costs for these types of ev ents. 
In general, the Utility do
es not earn a return on regulatory assets if the related costs do not accrue interest.  Accordingly, the Utility earns a return only on itsregulatory

extent these differ ences are probable of recovery or refund over the next 12 months, the Utility records a current regulatory balancingaccount receivable o
r payable.     Regulatory balancing accounts that the Utility expects to collect or refund over a perio d exceeding 12 months are re corded asother noncurrent assets – r
egulatory assets or noncurrent liabilities – regulatory liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These differences do not have an 
impact on net income .  Balancing accou nts will fluctuate during the year based on seasonal electric and gas usage and the timing of when costs areincurred and cu

Revolving
Credit
Facilities
In May 2017, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
each extended the t ermination dates of th eir existing revolving credit facilities by one year from April 27, 2021 toApril 27, 2022. 
  PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's revolving credit fac ilities may be used for working capital, the r epayment of commercial paper, and othe r corporate purposes. 
 
Borrowings under each credit ag
reement (other than swingline loans) will bear interest based on the borrower’s credit r ating and on each borrower’s election of either 
(1) a London Interbank Offered Ra te (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin or (2) the base r ate plus an applicable margin.  The base rate will equal the higherof the following: 
  the administrative agent’s announced base rate, 0.5% above the overnight federal funds rate, and the one-month LIBOR plus an applicablemargin. 
  T he borrower’s credit rating at the time of borrowing will determine the applicable rate within the following ranges.   The applicable margin for LIBORloans will range between 0.9% and 1.475
% under PG&E Corporation’s credit agreement and between 0.8% and 1. 275% under the Utility’s cr edit agreement.   Theapplicable margin fo
r base rate loans will range between 0% and 0.475% under PG&E Corporation’s credit agreement and between 0% and 0.275% under theUtility’s credit agreement.  I
n addition, the facility fee under PG&E Corporation’s and the Utili ty’s credit agreements will range between 0.1% and 0.275% andbetween 0.075% and 0.225%, respectiv

lt and covenants limiting liens to those p ermitted under their senior note indentures, me rgers, sales of all or substantially all of their assets, and other fundament
al changes.  In addition, the respective revolving credit fac ilities require that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain a ratio of totalconsolidated debt to t
otal consolidated capitalization of at most 65% as of the end of each fiscal quarter .  PG&E Corporation’s revolving credit facility agreement also requires that PG&E Corporat
ion own s , directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the outstanding common stock and at least 70 % of the outstanding voting capital stock of the Utility.
 
Commercial
Paper
Program
s  
The 
borrowings from PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility ’s commercial pape r programs are used primarily to fund temporary financing needs.  PG&ECorporation and the Utility c
an issue commercial paper up to the maximum amounts of $300 million and $2.5 billion, re spectively.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility treat the amount of
 outstanding commercial paper as a reduction to the amount available under their respective revolving credit facilities.  The commercial paper may have maturi
ties up to 365 days and ranks equ ally with PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s other unsubordinated and unsecur ed indebtedness. Commercial paper notes are 
sold at an interest rate dictated by the market at the time of issuance.   For 2017 , the average yield on outst anding PG&E Corporatio n and Utility commerci
al paper was 1.29 % and 1.11 % , respectively .  
Other
Short-term
Borrowings

In February 2017, PG&E Corporation amended i
ts February 2015 EDA providing for the sale of PG&E Corporation common stock having an aggregate price of upto $275 million.  During 2017 
, PG&E Corporation sold 0.4 million shares of its common stock under the February 2017 EDA for cash proceeds of $ 28.4 million, net of commissions paid of $ 
0.2 million .   There were no issuances under the February 2017 EDA for the three months ended Dece mber 31, 2017.  As ofDecember 31, 2017, the remain

 Dividends
 
Ordinarily, the Board of Direc
tors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility de clare dividends quarterly.  Under the Utility’s Articles of Incorporation, the Utilitycannot pay common stock dividends un
less all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock have been paid.  Under their r espective credit agreements, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility are each required to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated capitalization of at most 65%.  Basedon the calculation of th
is ratio for each company, no amount of PG&E Corpo ration's retained ea rnings and $218 million of the Utility's retained earnings wassubject to this restri
ction at December 31, 2017.  Additionally, the Utility's net assets, and therefore its ability to pay dividends, are restricted by the CPUC-authorized capital s
tructure, which requires the Utility to maintain, on average, at least 52% equity.  Based on the calculation of this ratio,  $14.3 billion of the Utility's net assets were r
estricted at December 31, 2017.  Additionally, as a result of this requirement, the Utility's ability to pay dividends in the future could beimpacted by future poten
tial liabilities.  On December 20, 2017, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation suspended quarter ly cash dividends on PG&E Corporation’s common stock, beginn
ing with the fourth quarter of 2017 due to uncertainty related to the causes of and potential liabilities associated with theNorthern California wildfi
res.  (See “Northern California Wildfires” i n Note 13 below.)  
For the first quarter of 2017, 
the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a common stock dividend of $0.49 per share quarterly.  In May 2017, the Boardof Directors of PG&E Corporation approv
ed a new annual common stock cash dividend of $0.53 per share quart erly.  In 2017, total dividends declared were $1.55per share.

Units

R 
estricted stock units generally vest equally ov er three year s .   Vested restricted stock units are settled in shares of PG&E Corporation common stockaccompanied by cash paymen
ts to settle any divi dend equivalents associat ed with the vested restricted stock units.  Compensation expense is generally recognized rateably over the 
vesting period based on grant-date fair value .  The weighted average grant-date fair value for restricted stock units grante d during 2017 , 2016 , and 
2015 was $ 66.95 , $ 56.68 , and $ 53.30 , respectively.  The tota l fair value of restricted stock units that vested during 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 was $ 57million, 
$ 36 million, and $ 57 million, respectively.  The tax benefit from restricted stock units that vested during each period was not material.   In general, forfeitures are re
corded rateably over the vesting period, using historical averages and adjusted to act uals when vesting occurs.  As of December 31, 2017 , $ 33 million of total unrecogniz
ed compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units was expected to be recognized over the remai ning weighted average period of 
1.46 years.

Performance shares gene
rally will vest three years after the grant date.  Upon vesting, performance shares are settled in sh ares of common stock based on either PG&E Corporation’s total sharehold
er return relative to a specified group of industry peer companies over a three-year performance period or , for a small numberof awards, 
an internal PG&E Corpor ation metric .  Dividend equivalents are pa id in cash based on the amount of common stock to which the recipients areentitled. 
 
Compensation expen
se attributable to performance share is generally recognized rateably over the applicable three-year period based on the grant-date f air valuedetermined using a Monte Car

PG&E Corporation has authorized 
80 million shares of no par value preferred stock and 5 million shares of $ 100 par value preferred stock , which may be issued as redeemable or nonred
eemable preferred stock.  PG&E Corporation does not have any preferred stock outstand ing .  
The Utility has authorized 
75 million shares of $ 25 par value preferred stock and 10 million shares of $ 100 par value preferred stock.  At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Utility’s p
referred stock outstanding included $ 145 million o f shares with interest r ates between 5% and 6% designated as nonredeemablepreferred stock and $ 
113 million of shares with interest rates between 4.36%   and 5% that are redeemable between $ 25.75 and $ 27.25 per share.  The Utility’s preferred stock outstand

113
 

 At December 31, 
2017 , annual dividends on the Utility’s nonredeemable pre ferred stock ranged fro m $ 1.25 to $ 1.50 per share.  The Utility’s r edeemablepreferred stock is subje
ct to redemption at the Utility’s option, in whole or in part, if the Utility p ays the specified redemption price plus accumulated and unpaiddividends through the redempt
ion date.  At December 31, 2017 , annual d ividends on redeemable pr eferred stock ranged from $ 1.09 to $ 1.25 per share.  
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directo
rs of P G&E Corporation and the Utility determined to suspend quarterly cash divid ends on the Utility’s preferredstock, beginning with the three
-month period ending January 31, 2018, due to uncertainty related to causes and potential liabilities associated with the October2017 Northern California wildfi
r es.  See “Northern California Wildfires” in Note 13 below .)  
Dividends on all Utility pref
erred stock are cumulative.  All shares of preferred stock have voting rights and an equal preference in dividend and liquidation rights. Upon liquidation or 
dissolution of the Utility, hold ers of preferred stock would be entitled to the par value of such shares plus all accumulated and unpaiddividends, as specified for 
the class and series.   T he Utility paid $ 14 million of dividends on preferred stock in ea ch of 2017, 2016, and 2015.

INCOME
TAXES

PG&E Corporation and the Utility use th
e asset and liability method of a ccounting for income taxes.  The i ncome tax provision includes current and deferred income taxes resulting 
from operations during the year. PG&E Corporation and the Utility estimate current peri od tax expense in addition to calculating deferredtax assets and liabilities.
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary tax and accounting timing differences, such as those arising from depreciationexpens 
e.  
PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
recognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return will besustained upon examination by t
axing authorities based on the merits of the position.  T he tax benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured based onthe largest amount of ben
efit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  As such, t he difference between a tax position taken or expected tobe taken in a t 
ax return in future periods and the benefit recogni zed and measured pursuant to this guidance in the financial statements represents an unrecognized tax benefit. 
 
Investment tax credi
ts are deferred and amortized to income over time.  PG&E Corporation am ortizes its investmen t tax credits over the projected investmentrecovery period. 
  The Utility amortizes its investment tax credits over the life of the related property in accordance with regulatory treatment. 
PG&E Corporation files a consolida
ted U.S. f ederal income tax r eturn that includes the Utility and domestic subsidiaries in which its ownership is 80% or more. PG&E Corporation files a combined s
tate income tax return in California.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to a tax-sharing agr eement under which the Utility determin
es its income tax provision (benefit) on a stand-alone basis.

All amounts are impacted by the level of income before income taxes.  The 2014 GRC and 2015 GT&S rate case decis ions authorized revenuerequirements that reflect flow-through ratemaking for temporary income tax differences attributable to repair costs and 
certain other property-related costs for federal tax purposes.  For these temporary tax differences, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize the deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabil
ities.  Therefor e, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s effective tax rates are impacted as these differences arise and reverse.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or
liabilities as it is probable that 
these amounts will be r ecovered from or returned to customers in future rates.  116

The component of unre 
cognized tax benefits th at, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate at December 31, 2017 for PG &E Corporation and the Utility was $ 
21 million .  
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s un
recognized tax benefits may change significantly within the next 12 months due to the resolution of several matters,including audits. 
  As of December 31, 2017, it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits will decreas e by approximately $ 20 million within the next 12months.
 
Interest income, int
erest expense and penalties associated with income taxes are reflected in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of In come.  For t he years ended December 31, 2017 
, 2016, and 201 5 , these amounts were immaterial. 
Tax
Cuts
and
Jobs
Act
of
2017  
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enac
ted expansive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act.  Among other provi sions, the Tax Act reduces the federal 
income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning on January 1, 2018 and eliminated bonus depreciation for utilities.  The Tax Actrequired PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity to re-measure all existing deferred in come tax assets and liabilitie s to reflect the reduction in the federal tax rate. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
made reasonable estimates to reflect the impacts of the Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts, in accordance withrules issued by th 
e SEC in Staff Account ing Bulletin No. 118 , for the re-measure ment of deferred tax balances as of December 31, 2017.  
During the three months and yea
r ended December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation, on a consolidated basis, recorded a one-time provisional tax expense of $147 million to reflec
t the transitional impacts of the Tax Act.  Of this amount, $83 million is attributable to the re-measurement of PG&E Corporation’s net deferred taxasset comprised prima
rily of net operating loss carry-forwards and compen sation-related items.  The remai ning $64 million is related to the re-measurement of theUtility’s deferred t
axes not reflected in authorized revenue requirements, such as disallowed plant.  The Utility also recorded a provisional $5. 7 billi on re-measurement of its deferred tax
 balances (related to flow-through and normalized timing differences for plant-related items) which was offset by a change from anet deferred income 
tax regulatory asset to a net regulatory liability.  The deferred inc ome tax regulatory liability will be refunded to customers over the regulatorylives of the related 
assets.  
117
 

 The final transition i
mpacts of the Tax Act may differ from the above recorded amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, regulato ry decisions from the CPUC that could differ f
rom the Utility’s determination of how the impacts of the Tax Act are allocated between customers and shareholders.  In addition,while PG&E Corporation and the Utility we
re able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of the reduction  in federal tax rate and the elimination of bonusdepreciation due to the 
enactment of the Tax Act; changes in interpretations, guidance on legislative intent, and any changes in accounting standards for incometaxes in response 
to the Tax Act could impact the recorded amounts.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility will finalize and record any adjustments related to the TaxAct within the one year measu
rement period provided under S taff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 .  
Tax
Settlements
 
PG& 
E Corporation’s tax returns hav e been accepted through 2015 except for a few matters, the most significant of which relates to deductible repair costs for gastransmission and distribut
ion lines of business.   In February 2017, the Joint Committee of Taxati on approved PG&E Corporation’s settle ment with the IRS relatedto deductible elect
ric transmission and distribution repairs for the 2011 and 2012 tax years.   The agreement provided that the methodology used in determining thedeductible amount should be fo 
llowed for all subsequent per iods, absent any material change in facts.   In November 2017, PG&E Corporation reached anagreement with the IRS on deduct
ible generation repairs for the 2013 and 2014 tax years.   The IRS may issue guidance in 2018 that clarifi es which repair costs are deductible for th
e natural gas transmission and distribution lines of business.   
Tax years after 2008 remai
n subject to examination by the state of California.

Transmission
and
Storage
Rate
Case
 
The final phase two de 
cision reduced rate bas e by the full amount of the disallowed capital expenditures but did not remove the associated deferred taxes, whichthe Utility believes cons
titutes a normalization violation.  In the final decision, the CPUC authorized the Utility t o establish a Tax Normaliz ation MemorandumAccount to track relevan
t costs and clarified that it is the CPUC’s intention that the Utility comply with normalization rules and avoid the potential adverseconsequences of a normali
zation violation.  The CPUC a llowed the Utility to seek a ruling from the IRS and the Utility filed the ruling request with the IRS onApril 10, 2017.  On October 5, 2017, the IRS issued a privat
e letter ruling indicating the final decision rate base reduction was inconsistent with the IRS tax normalization requiremen 
ts.  As a result of the IRS private letter ruling, the Utility filed an advice letter with the CPUC on December 11, 2017, requesting a ratebase adjustment of $7 mil
lion, $28 million, $49 million, and $61 million, in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.

DERIVATIVES

Use
of
Derivative
Instruments
 
The Utility is expo
sed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities.  Procurement costs are recovered throughcustomer rates.  The Util
ity uses both derivative and non-derivative contracts to manage volatili ty in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices. Derivatives include cont
racts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs .  
Derivatives are presen
ted in the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets recorded at fa ir value and on a net basis in accordance with master netting arrangements foreach counterparty.  The f
air value of derivative instruments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the intention to offsetexist. 
 
Price risk management 
activities that meet the definition of derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These instruments are notheld for speculative purpos
es and are subject to certain regulatory requirements.  The Uti lity expects to fully reco ver in rates all costs related to derivatives under the applicable 
ratemaking mechanism in place as long as the Utility’s price r isk management activities are carried out in accordance with CPUC directives. Therefore, all unreali 
zed gains and losses associat ed with the change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recorded within the Utility’s regulatoryassets and liabiliti
es on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Net realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives a re recorded in the cost of electricity or the costof natural gas with correspond
ing increases or decreases to regulatory balancing accounts for recovery from or refund to customers. 
The Utility elects the no
rmal purchase and sale exception for eligible d erivatives.  Eligible derivati ves are those that require physical delivery in quantities that areexpected to be used by the Util
ity over a reasonable period in the normal course of business, and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the commoditydelivered.  These 
items are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  Eligible derivatives are accounted for under the accrual method ofaccounting.

impact of cash collateral postings. ( 
2) These amounts are fully passed through to customers in rates.  Accordingly, net income was not impacted by realized amounts on these instruments. 
Cash inflows and outflows associated with d
erivatives are included i n operating cash flows on the Util ity’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
The majority of the Utilit
y’s derivatives contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies .   AtDecember 
31, 2017 , the Utility’s credit rating was investment grade.  If the Utility’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the Utility would berequired to post additiona
l cash immediately to fully collateralize some of its net liability deriv ative positions.

NOTE

FAIR
VALUE
MEASUREMENTS 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility me
asure their cash equivalents, trust assets and price risk management instruments at fair value.  A three -tier fair valuehierarchy is establ 
ished that prioritizes th e inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value :  
Level


1
–
Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
Level


2
–
Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observabl e in the marketplace. 
Level


3
–
Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activities. 
120
 

 The fair value hiera
rchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable in puts when measuring fair valu e. 
Assets and liabilities m
easured at fair value on a recurring basis for PG&E Corporation and the Utility are summarized below .  A ssets held in rabbi trusts are heldby PG&E Corporation and not the Utility

Fair
Value
 
In general, investments h
eld in the trusts are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and market volatility risks.  N uclear decommissioning trustassets and other trust asse
ts are composed primarily of equity and fixed-income securities and also include short-te rm investments that are money market fundsvalued at Level 1 
.  
Global e 
quity securi ties primarily include i nvestments in common stock th at are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified as L evel 1. 
Fixed-income 
securities are pri marily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income se curities, includingcorporate debt securi
ties.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value isdetermined by observable
 market prices in acti ve markets.  A market a pproach is generally used to estimate the fair value of fixed-income securities classified as Level 2 
using evaluated pricing da ta such as broker quotes, for simi lar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation model generally include bench
mark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuationmodel, as applicable.

in the fair value hierarchy tables above.  The fair value amounts are included in th e tables above in order to reconcile to the amountspresented in the Consolidated Ba
lance Sheets.  These investments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securit ies traded publicly on exchangesas well as fixed-inc 
ome securities that are composed primarily of U.S. government securities and asset-backed securities.  
Price
Risk
Management
Instruments

Price risk management 
instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreem ents, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs that are traded either on 
an exchange or over-the-counter.  
Power purchase agreements, fo
rwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded futures that are valued using obs ervable market forward prices 
for the underlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-traded futures, or are valued using forward pr
ices from broker quotes that are corroborated with marke t data are classified as Level  2.  Exchange-traded and over-the-counter options are valued using observab
le market data and market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2.   
Long-dated power purchase agre
ements that are valued using significant unobservable data are c lassified as Level 3.  These Level 3 contracts are valued usingeither estimated b
asis adjustments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends beyond aperiod 
for which market data is available.   Market and credit risk ma nagement utilizes mod els to derive pricing inputs for the valuation of the Utility’s Level 3instruments 
using pricing inputs from br okers and historical data.  
The Utility holds CRRs to hedge 
the financial risk of CAISO-impos ed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is available in the CAISOauction and between auction d
ates; therefore, the Utility utilizes historical prices to f orecast forward prices .  CRRs are classif ied as Level 3.  
Level

Measurements
and
Sensitivity
Analysis
 
The Utility’s market and 
credit risk m anagement function, which reports to the Chi ef Financial Officer, is responsible for deter mining the fair value of the Utility’sprice risk manag 
ement de rivatives.  The Utility’s finance and risk management func tions collaborate to determine the ap propriate fair value methodologies andclassification for 
each derivative.  Inputs used and the fair value of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions todetermine reasonableness.
 
123
 

 Significant increases o
r decreases in any of those inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reason able costs related toLevel 3 instruments are 
expected to be recoverable t hrough customer rates; therefore, there is no impact to net income resulting from changes in the fair value ofthese instruments.

Financial
Instruments

PG&E Corporation and the Utility use th
e following methods and assumptions in estimating fair value for financial instruments: 
The fair values of cash 
, restricted cash , net accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, customer deposits, floating rate senior notes, and the Utility’s variab
le rate pollution control bond loan agreement s approximate their carrying values at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , as they areshort-term in nature or ha 
ve interest rates th at reset daily .   
The fair values of the Uti
lity’s fixed - rate senior notes and fixed - rate pollution control bond s and PG&E Corporation’s fixed - rate senior notes were based on quoted market pric
es at December 31, 2017 and 2016 .

Expected rates of retu
rn on plan assets were developed by determining projected stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target assetallocations of the emp
loyee benefit plan trusts, resulting in a weight ed average rate of return on pl an assets.  Returns on fixed-income debt investments were projected based on real 
maturity and credit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate.  Returns on equity investments were estimated based on es timates ofdividend yield and real e
arnings growth a dded to a long-term infl ation rate .  For the pension plan, the assumed return of 6.2 % compares to a ten-year actual return of 
7.8 %.  The rate used to discount pension benefits and ot her benefit s was based on a yield curve developed from market data of over approximately 623 Aa-grade non-callable bonds 
at December 31, 2017 .  This yield curve has discount rates th at vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated futurecash flows for the pension 
benefits and other benefit obliga tions were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average dis count rate.
 
Investment
Policies
and
Strategies
 
The financial position of PG&E Corpor
ation’s and the Utility’s funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefitobligations.  
Volatility in funde d status occurs wh en asset values change dif ferently from liability values and can result in fluctuations in costs in financial reporting 
, as well as the amount of min imum contributions required under the Employee Retirement In come Security Act of 1974, as amended .  P G&E Corporation’s and the Utili
ty’s investment policies and strategies are designed to increase the ratio of trust assets to plan liabilities at an acceptable level of fundedstatus volatility. 
 
The trusts 
’ asset allocations are meant to manage volatility, reduce costs, and diversify its holdings .   Interest rate, credit, and equity risk are the key determinantsof PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility
’s funded status volatility.  In addition to affecting the trusts’ fixed income portfolio market values, interes t rate changes also influence liabi
lity valuations as discount rates move with current bond yields.  To manage volatility , PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s trust s hold significant allocations in 
long maturity fixed-income investments . A lthough they co ntribute to funded status vol atility, equity investments are held to reducelong-term funding costs due to 
their higher expected return.  Real assets and absolute return invest ments are held to diversify the trust ’s holdings in equity and fixed-income inve 
stments by exhibiting retu rns with low correlation to the direction of these markets.   R eal assets include commodities futures, global REITS, and 
global listed infrastructure equities.  Absolute return investments include hedge fund portfolios .

 Derivative 
instruments such as equity ind ex futures are used to meet target equity exposure.   Derivative instruments, such as equity index futures and U.S. treasuryfutures, are also used to r
ebalance the fixed income/equity allocation of the pension’s portfolio.   F oreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge a portionof the non U.S. dollar exposure of global 
equity investments.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility apply 
a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets.  The guidingprinciples of this risk
 management framework are the clear articulation of roles an d responsibilities, appropr iate delegation of authority, and proper accountabilityand documentation.  Trust inves
tment policies and investment manager guidelines include provisions designed to ensure prudent diversif ication, manage riskthrough appropriat 
e use of physical direct asset holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited investments.

 Valuation
Techniques
 
The following describes the va
luation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the tabl e above.   All investments that are valued using a NAV per share can be red
eemed quarterly with a notice not to exceed 90 days. 
Short-Term
Investments

Short-term investments 
consist primarily of comming led funds across government, credi t, and asset-backed sectors.  These securitie s are categorized as Level 1and Level 2 assets.
 
Global
Equity
 
The global equity 
category include s investments in common stock and equity-index futures .  Equity investments in common s tock are actively traded on publicexchanges 
and are therefore cons idered Level 1 assets.  These equity investments are generally valued based on unadjusted prices in active mar kets for identical securities.  Equity-index 
futures are valued based on unadjusted p rices in active markets and are Level 1 assets .  
Real
Assets
 
The real asset 
category includes portfo lios of commodity futures, global REITS and global listed infrast ructure equities .  The commodity futures, global REITS, and global listed infras
tructure equities are actively traded on a publ ic exchange and are the refore considered Level 1 assets.  
Fixed-Income

Fixed-income 
  securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, includingcorporate debt securities. 
  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair valueis determined by observabl
e market prices in active markets.   A market approach is generally used to estimate the fa ir value of debt securities  classified as Level 2using evaluated pricing da
ta such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.   Significant inputs used in the valuation modelgenerally include bench
mark yield curves and i ssuer spreads.   The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in thevaluation model, as appli
cable.

CONTINGENCIES
AND
COMMITMENTS 
PG 
&E Cor poration and the Utility have significant conting encies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to enforcement and litigation matters and environmen
tal remediation . A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both prob able that a loss has been in curred and the amount ofthe loss can be reasonably es
timated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on thelower end of the range, unless an 
amount with in the range is a bette r estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonablypossible, and whether the loss or a 
range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss con tingencies are reviewed quarterly and estima
tes are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice oflegal counsel, and other in
formation and events pertaining to a parti cular matter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s p rovision for loss and expense excludesanticipated legal 
costs, which are expensed as incurred .   The Utility also has substantial financial commitments in connection with agreements entered into tosuppo 
rt its operating activities.   See “Purchase Commitments” below.  PG&E Corporation has financial co mmitments described in “Other Commitments” below.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be mate rially affected by the outcom e of the followingmatters.

Northern
California
Wildfires

Beginning on October 8, 2017, multiple wild
fires spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, But te, Humboldt, Mendocino, Del Norte, Lake,Nevada, and Yuba Counties, as well as in the 
area surrounding Yuba City.  According to the Cal Fire California Statewide Fire Summary dated October   30, 2017,at the peak of th 
e wildfires, there were 21 major wildfires in California that, in total, burned over 245,000 acres, resulted in 43 fatalities, and destroyed anestimated 8,900 structur
es.  Subsequently, the number of fatalities increased to 44. 
The 
Utility incurred $ 219 million in costs for service res toration and repair to the Utility’s facilities (including $97 million in capital expenditures) through December 31, 2017 
in connection with these fi res.  While the Utility believes that such costs a re recoverable through C EMA , its CEMA requests are subject to CPUC approval.  
The Utility’s financial condition, r esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to recoversuch costs.
 
The fires are 
being investigated by Cal Fire and the CPUC , including the possible role o f the Utility ’s power lines and other fac ilities.   The Utility expects that Cal Fire will issue a report o
r reports stating its conclusions as to the sources of ignition of the fires and the ways that they pr ogressed.  The CPUC’s SED also is conducting investigatio
ns to assess the compliance of electric and communication companies’ facilities with applicable rules and regulations in fire impactedareas.  
According to information m ade available by the CPUC, inve stigation topics include , but are not limited to, maintenance of facilities, vegetationmanagement, and emerg
ency preparedness and response.   Various other entities, including fire departments, may also be investigating certain of the fires.  (Forexample, 
on February 3, 2018, it was reported tha t investigators with the Santa Rosa Fire Department had completed their investigation of two small fires thatreportedly destroyed two homes 
and damaged one outbuilding and had concluded that the Utility’s facilitie s, along with high wind and other facto rs, contributed tothose fires.)  
It is uncertain when the inv estigations will be complete and whether Cal Fire will release any preliminary findings before its investigation is complete. 
As of January 31, 2018 
, the Utility had submitted 22 e lectric incident reports to the CPUC associated with the Northern Ca lifornia wildfires where Cal Fire hasidentified a site as po
tentially involving the Utility’s facilities in its investigation and the p roperty damage associated with each incident exce eded $50,000.  The information contained in t
hese reports is factual and preliminary, and does not reflect a determination of th e causes of the fires.   The in vestigations into the fires are ongoing.
 
If the 
Utility’s facilities, such as its electric dis tribution and transmission lines, are determined to be the cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, the 
Utility could be liable for prope rty damage, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, which liabil ity, in theaggregate, could be substant
ial and have a material adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility .  California c ourts have imposed liabil ity under thedoctrine 
of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property wasdamaged through a public use unde
rtaking should be spread across the community that benefitted from su ch undertaking and based on the assu mption that utilitieshave the ability to re
cover these costs from their customers.  Further, courts could deter mine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation app lies even in the absenceof an open CPUC proceeding for co 
st recovery, or before a po tential cost recovery decision is issued by the CPUC.  There is no guarantee tha t the CPUC wouldauthorize cost recove
ry even if a court decision were to determine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation app lies.  In addition t o such claims for property damage, interest and a
ttorneys’ fees, the Utility could be liable for fi re suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury damages, and otherdamages under other theor
ies of liability, including if the Util ity were found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and havea material adverse effect on 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility .   Further, the Utility could be subject to mate rial fines or penalties if the CPUC or any other law enforcement agency broug
ht an enforcement action and determined that the Utility failed to comply with appl icable laws and regulations.

 Given the preliminary st
ages of investigations and the uncertainty as to the causes of the fires, PG&E Corpor ation and the Utility do not be lieve a loss is probableat this time.  However, it is 
reasonably possible that facts could emerge through the course of the various investigations that lead PG&E Corporation and the Utilityto believe that a loss is p
robable , resulting in an accrued liability in the future, the amount of which could be material.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility currently are unable to reasonably 
estimate the amount of losses (or range of amounts) that they could incur given the preliminary s tages of the investigat ions and the uncertainty regarding 
the extent and magnitude o f potential damages. On January 31, 2018 , the California Departm ent of Insurance issued a press releaseannouncing an update on property loss
es in connection with the Octo ber and December wildfir es in California, stating that, as of such date, “insurers havereceived nearly 45,000 insur
ance claims totaling more than $11.79 billion in losses,” of which approximately $10 billion relates to statewide claims from theOctober 20 
17 wildfires.  The remaining amount relates to claims from the Southern California December 2017 wildfires.  According to the California Departmentof Insurance, as of the dat
e of the press release, more than 21,000 homes, 3,200 businesses, and more than 6 ,100 vehicles, watercraf t, farm vehicles, and otherequipment were damaged or d
estroyed by the October 2017 wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not independently verified these estimates.  TheCalifornia Department o
f Insurance did not state in its press release wheth er it intends to provide updated estimates of losses in the future. 
If the Utility’s fac
ilities are determined to be the cause of one or more of the Northern California wildfires, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be liable for the related property 
losses and other damages.  The California Departmen t of Insurance January 31, 2018 press release r eflects insured property losses only.  Thepress release does not ac
count for uninsured losses, interest, attorneys’ fees, fire suppr ession costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury andwrongful death damages or othe
r costs.   If the Utility were to be found liable for certain or all of such other costs and expenses, the amount of PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s lia bility could be higher than the approximately $10 billion estimated in respect of the wildfires that occurred in October 2017,depending on the extent of the d
amage in connection with such fire or fires.  As a result, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s f inancial condition, resu lts ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows could be materially affected.   
As of January 31, 2018 
, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of 111 lawsuits, six of which seek to be certi fied as class action s , that have been fil ed against 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility in the Sonoma, Napa and San Francisco Counties Superior Courts.  The lawsuits allege, among oth er things, negligence,inverse condemnation, tr
espass, and private nuisance.  They principally assert that PG&E Corpo ration’s and the Utility ’s alleged failure to maintain and repairtheir distribution and t
ransmission lines and failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the fires .   The plaintiffs seekdamages that include 
wrong ful death, personal injury, property da mage, evacuation costs, medical expenses, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and otherdamages.  
In addition, insurance ca rriers who have made payments to their insureds for property damage arising out of the fires ha ve filed three subrogation complaints in the San Francis
co County Superior Court .
   These complaints allege, among other things, negligence, inverse condemnation, trespass and nuisance. The allegations are si
milar to the ones made by individual plaintiffs.   On October 31, 2017, a group of plaintiffs sub mitted a petition for coordination to the Chairof the Judicial Council of Cal
ifornia and requested coordination of the litigation in the San Francisco Superior Court.  On November 9, 2017, PG&E Corporation and the Utility submitted a p
etition for coordination to the Chair of the Judicial Council of California, and requested separate coordination in the counties in whichthe fires occurred.  On Janua
ry 4, 2018, the coordination motion judge of the San Francisc o Superior Court entered an orde r granting coordination of the litigationin connection with the Northern Ca
lifornia wildfires and recommending that the coordinated proceeding take place in the San Francisco Superior Court.  OnJanuary 12, 2018, the Judici 
al Council of California a ccepted the coordination motion judge’s recommendation and assigned the coordinated proceeding to SanFrancisco.  The first case 
management conference is scheduled for February 27, 2018. 
 
In addition, two derivative 
lawsuits for breach of fiduciary dut ies and unjust enrichment were filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court on November   16,2017 and November 
  20, 2017, respectively.  The first lawsuit is fil ed against the members of the Board of Directors and certain officers of PG&E Corporation . PG&E Corporation 
is identified as a nominal  defendant in that action.   The second lawsuit is filed against the members of the Board of Directors, certain formermembers of the Board of Dire
ctors, and certain officers of both PG&E Corp oration and the Utility .   PG&E Corporation and the Utility are identified as nominal defendants in that act
ion.   Motions to consolidate the two l awsuits, appoint lead plaintiffs’ counsel, and enter a case schedule are currently pending.  
PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility expect to be the subject o f additional lawsuits in connection with the Northern California wildfires.   The wildfire litigationcould take a number of yea
rs to be resolved because of the complexity of the matters, including the ongoing inve stigation into the causes of the fires and the growing number of parties and c
laims involved.  The Utility has liabili ty insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party liabilityattributable to the Norther
n California wildfires in an aggregate amount of app roximately $800 million.  If the Utility were to be found liable for on e or more fires,the Utility's insurance cou
ld be insufficient to cover that liability, depending on the extent of the damage in connection with such fire or fires.    Following theNorthern California wildfi
res, PG&E Corporation reinstated its liability insurance in the amount of approximately $630   million for any potential future event. 
136
 
 
 

In addition, it could take a number of years before the Utility’s final liability is known and the Utility could apply for cost recove ry.  The Utility may be unable to recover costs in excess of 
insurance through regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take a number of years to resolve and a num ber of years thereafter to collect.  
Further, SB 819, introduced in the Califo rnia Senate in January 2018, if it becomes law, would prohibit utilities from recovering costsin excess of insurance resu
lting from damages caused by such utilities’ facilities, if the CPUC determines that the u tility did not reasonably construct, maintain,manage, control, or opera
te the facilities.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have considered certa in actions that might be taken to attempt to address liquidityneeds of the 
business in such circumstanc es, but the inability to recover costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collecting such rates in atimely manner, or any neg
ative assessment by the Utility of the likelihood or tim eliness of such recovery and collection, could have a material adverse effect onPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, r esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

Connection
with
the
Butte
Fire

In September 2015, 
a wildfire (known as the “Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.  On April 28, 2016, Cal Fire 
  released its report of the investigation of the origin and cause of the wildfire. According to Cal Fire’s repo rt, the fire burned 70,868 acres, resu lted in twofatalities, destroyed 
549 homes, 368 outbuildings and four comm ercial properties, and damaged 44 structures.  Cal Fire’s   report concluded that the wildfire wascaused when a 
gray p ine tree contacted   the Uti lity’s   electric line which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by the Utility   and/or itsvegetation managemen
t contractors, ACRT Inc. and Trees, Inc.,   to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management program ultimately led to the failure of the tree.
 
Third-Party
Claims

On May 23, 2016, individual plaintiffs 
filed a master complaint against the Utility and its two vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California for Sacramento County. 
  Subrogation insurers also filed a separate master complaint on the same date.   The California Judicial Council had previouslyauthorized the coordina
tion of all cases in Sacramento County.   As of December 3 1 , 2017, 77 known compl aints have been filed ag ainst the Utility and its twovegetation managemen
t contractors in the Superior Court of California in the Counties of Calaveras, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Amador.  The complaintsinvolve approximately 3,770 
individual plaintif fs representing approximately 2 ,030 households and their insurance comp anies.   These complaints are part of orare in the process of being 
added to the two master complaints.   Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on the doc trine of inverse condemnation and negligenc
e theor y of liability.  Plaintiffs also seek punitive damages.  As of December 31, 2017, several pla intiffs have dismissed the Utility’stwo vegetation managemen
t contractors.  The number of individual comp laints and plaintiffs may still increase in the future , because the statute of limitations forproperty damages in connec
tion with the Butte fire has not yet expired .  (The statute of limitations for personal injury in connection with the Butte fire hasexpired.) 
  The Utility continues mediating and settling cases. 
In addition, on April 13, 2017, Cal Fire fi
led a complaint with the Superior Court of the Stat e of California, County of Calaveras, seeking to recover $87 mil lion forits costs incurred on the th
eory t hat the Utility and its veg etation management contractors were negligent, among other claims.   On July 31, 2017, Cal Fire dismissed its complaint 
against Tree’s, Inc., one of the Utility’s vegetation contractors.  The Utility and Cal Fire are currently eng aged in a mediation proc ess.   
Further 
, in May 2017, the OES indicated that i t intends to bring a claim against the Utility that it estimates in the approximate amount of $190 million.  This claimwould include costs incurred by th
e OES for tree and debr is removal, infrastru cture damage, erosion control, and other claims related to the Butte fire.  Also, inJune 2017, the County of Calaveras indic
ated that it intends to bring a claim against the Utility that it estimates in the approximate amount of $85 m illion.  This claim would include costs th
at the County of Calaveras incurred or expects to incur for infrastructure damage, erosion control, and other costs related to the Buttefire. 
 
On April 28, 2017, the Utility moved for sum
mary adjudication on plaintiffs’ claims for punitive damages.  On August 10, 2017, the Court denied the Utility’smotion on the grounds that plain
tiffs might be able to show con scious disregard for public s afety based on the fact that the Utility relied on contractors to fulfilltheir contractual ob
ligation to hire and train qualified employees.  On August 16, 2017, the Utility filed a writ with the Court of Appeals challenging w hat theUtility believes is a 
novel theory of punitive dam ages liability.  The Court of Appeals accepted the writ on September 15, 2017 and ordered the trial court andplaintiffs to show cause why the r
elief requested by the Utility should not be granted. Briefing on the writ was completed as of January 2, 2018 .   The Utility isseeking expedited review of 
the motion.

On June 22, 2017, the Superior Court for the County of Sac
ramento ruled on a motion of several plaintiffs and found that the doctrine of inv erse condemnationapplies to the Utility with 
respect to the Butte fire.  The court held, among other things, that the Utility had failed to put forth any evidence to support its contentionthat the CPUC would not allow the Utility to pass on 
its inverse c ondemnation liability through rate increases .  While the ruling is binding on ly between theUtility and the plainti
ffs in the coordination proceeding, others could file lawsuits and make similar claims.  On January 4, 2018, the Utility filed wi th the court a renewed motion for a lega
l determination of inverse condemnation liability, citing the November 30, 2017 CPUC decision denying the San Diego Gas & ElectricCompany application to recov
er wildfire costs in excess of insurance, and the CPUC declaration tha t it will not automati cally allow utilities to spread inversecondemnation losses through ra
te increases.  The motion is set for hearing on March 15, 2018. 
Estimated
Losses
from
Third-Party
Claims

In connection with this mat
ter, the Utility may be liable for property damages, int erest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, through thedoctrine 
of inverse condemnation.  
In addition, the Utility m
ay be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to have been n egligent. While the Utility bel
ieves it was not negligent, there can be no assurance that a court or jury would agree with the Utility.  
The Utility currently be
lieves that it is probable that it will in cur a loss of at least $1.1 billion, increased from the $750 million previously estimated as ofDecember 31, 2016, in connection with 
the Butte fire.  The Utility’s updated estimate resulted primarily from an increase in the number of claims filed against the Utility and experience 
to date in resolving claims.  This amount is based on updated assumptions about the number, si ze, and type of structures damaged ordestroyed, the contents of such s
tructures, the number and types of tree s damaged or destroyed, as well as assumptions about personal injury damages, attorneys’fees, fire suppression costs, 
and certain other damages, but does not include punitive damages for whi ch the Utility could be li able.  In addition, w hile this amount i 
ncludes the Utility’s assumptions about fire suppression costs (including its assessment of the Cal Fire loss), it does not include any significant portion of theestimated claims 
from the OES and the County of Calaveras.   The Utility still does not have s ufficient information to reaso nably estimate the probable loss it may have for these additiona
l claims. 
The Utility currently is un
able to reasonably estimate the upper end of the range of losses due to the uncertainty of pending legal motions related to the applicability of inve
rse condemnation and punitive damages and because it has insufficient information on the claims of over 1,000 households and the claims fromthe OES and the County of Calaveras.  
The process for estimat ing costs associated with clai ms relating to the Butte fire requires management to exercisesignificant judgment bas
ed on a number of assumptions and subjective factors.  As more information becomes known, including additional discovery from theplaintiffs, results f
rom the ongoing med iation and settlemen t process, review of potential claims from the OES and the County of Calaveras, outcomes of futurecourt or jury decisions, and in
formation about damages, including punitive damages, that the Utility could be liable for, management esti mates and assumptions regarding the financial impact 
of the Butte fire may result in materia l increases to the loss a ccrued.

Loss
Recoveries

The Utility has liabili
ty insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party liability attributable to the Butte fire in an aggregate amount of $9 22 
million.  The Utility records insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that a recovery will occur and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount or itsrange.  
Through December 31, 2017, the Utility recorded $ 922 m illion for probable insurance recoveries in connection with losses related to the Butte fire.  Whilethe Utility plans to seek r
ecovery of all insured losses, it is unable to predict the ultimate amount and timing of such insurance recoveries.  In addition , in the year ended December 31, 2017, 
the Utility received $53 million of reimbursements from the insurance polic ies of one of its vegetation managemen t contractors ( excluded from t 
he table below) . Recoveries of additional amounts under the insurance pol icies of the Utility’s ve getation management contractor s , includingpolicies where the Utili
ty is listed as an add itional insured, are unc ertain.

During 
2014 and 2015, the Utility filed sev eral reports to notify the CPUC of communications that the Utility believes may have constituted or described ex partecommunications that e

r a commissioner’s advisor and interested persons concerning substantive issues in certain formal proceedings.  Certaincommunications are proh
ibited and others are permissible with proper noticing and repor ting. 
On November 23, 2015, the CPUC issued an OII into whether the Uti
lity should be sanctioned for violating rules pertaining to ex parte communications and Rule1.1 of the CPUC’s Rules of Practice and Procedur
e governing the conduct of those appear ing before the CPUC.  The OII cites some of the communications theUtility reported to the CPUC.  The OII also 
cites the ex parte violations alleged in th e City of San Bruno’s July 2014 motion, which it filed in CPUC investigatio ns related to the Utili
ty’s natural gas transmission pipeline operations and practices.

On March, 28, 2017, the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos, ORA, the SED, TURN, and the Utility 
jointly submitted to the CPUC a settlement agreement inconnection wi 
th the OII into the Utility ’s compliance with the CPUC’s ex parte communication rules.  On September 1, 2017, the assigned administrative law judge 
issued a PD in this proceeding adopting, wi th one modification, the settlement agreement jointly submitted to the CPUC on March 28, 2017, by the Utility, the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos, the ORA, the SED, and TURN.
 
If adopted, the PD would increase th
e payment to the California General Fund , relative to the set tlement agreement, from $1 million to $12 mil lion resulting in a total penalty of $97.5 mil
lion comprised of: (1) a $12 million payment to the California General Fund, (2) forgoing collection of $63.5 million of GT&S revenuerequirements for the y
ears 2018 ($31.75 million) and 2019 ($31.75 million), (3) a $10 million one-time  revenue requirement adjustment to be amortized inequivalent annual amounts ov
er the Utility’s next GRC cycle (i.e., the GRC following the 2017 GRC), and (4) compensation payments to the Cities of San Brunoand San Carlos in a to 
tal amount of $12 millio n ($6 million to each city).  In addition, the settlement agreement provides for certain non-financial remedies,including enhanced noticing ob
ligations between the Utility and CPUC decision-makers, as well as certification of emplo yee training on the CPUC ex parte communication rules.  Under 
the terms of the settlement agreement, customers will bear no costs associated with the financial remedies set forth above. 
On September 21, 2017, the Utility submi
tted a motion to the CPUC ac cepting the proposed  modification of the settlement agreement to increase the Utility’spayment to the Californi
a General Fund from $1 million to $12 million.  Further, the Utility also reported that it has identified several communications that appearto r 
aise issues similar to other communications that are part of this proceeding. 
On November 1, 2017, the Utility filed 
a status report advising the CPUC that the Utility and the non-Utility parties to the settlement agreement were unable toreach an agreem 
ent with respect to how to proce ed regarding the communications that the Utility reported to the CPUC on September 21, 2017.   Also onNovember 1, 2017, the non-Utility par
ties to the settlement requested that the CPUC approve the settlement, as modified by the PD, and open a second phase of the OII to investigate and consid
er appropriate sanctions for the new communications reported by the Utility on September 21, 2017, and others that may bediscovered.
 
On November 30, 2017, the CPUC issued a decision ex 
tending the statutory dead line to June 29, 2018 to resolve the proceeding.  The CPUC stated that anextension of the statutory d
eadline was necessary to allow the assigned administrative law judge time to prepare the revised decision and to open and resolve a second phase of this proceeding.
 
The Utility is unable to pred
ict the outcome of this proceeding. 
At December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation’s and the Ut
ility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include a $24 million accrual for the amounts payable to the Cali fornia General Fund and the Cities of San Bruno and San Car
los.  In accordance with accounting rules, adjustments related to revenue requirements would be recorded inthe periods in which they are

In 2012, the Utility notified 
the CPUC and the SED that the Utility planned to complete a system-wide survey of its transmission pipelines in an effort to address a self-reported viola
tion whereby the Utility did not properly identify encroachments (such as building structures and vegetation overgrowth) on the Utility’s pipelinerights-of-way. 
  The Utility also submitted a proposed compliance plan that s et forth the scope and  timing of remedial work to remove identified encroachmentsover a multi-year pe
riod and to pay penalties if the proposed milestones were not met.   In March 2014, the Utility informed the SED that the survey had beencompleted and tha 
t remediation work, includ ing removal of the encroachments, was expected to continue for several years.  The SED has not addressed theUtility’s proposed complian
ce plan, and it is reasonably possible that the SED will impose fines on the Utility in the fut ure based on the Utility’s f ailure tocontinuously survey its system and 
remove encroachments.  The Utility is unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of future charges that could beincurred given the SED’s wide discr
etion and the number of fact ors that can be consi dered in determining penalties.

The SED periodically audits uti
lity operating practices and conducts investigations of potential violations of laws and regulations applicable to the safety of theCalifornia 
utilities’ electric and natural g as facilities and ope rations.  The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issu e citations and impose penalties for violations identified 
through audits, investigations, or self -reports.  There are a number of aud it find ings, as well as other potenti al violations identified throughvarious investigations and th
e Utility’s self-reported non-compliance with laws and regulations, on which the SED has yet to act.  Under both the gas and electr icprograms, the SED has discreti 
on whether to iss ue a penalty for each vio lation. 
The SED has discretion whether to issue 
a penalty for each violation, but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutorypenalty of $50,000, with an administ
rativ e limit of $8 million p er citation issued.  The SED may, at its discretion, impose penalties on a daily basis, or on less thana daily basis, for violat
ions that continued for more than one day.  The SED also has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on the tot ality ofthe circumstances, in
cluding such factors as the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the number of persons affected; and thegood faith of the entity ch
arged in attempting to achieve c ompliance, after not ification of a violation.  The SED also is required to consider the appropriateness ofthe amount of the penalty 
to the size of the entity charged.  Historically, t he SED has exercised broad discre tion in determining whether violations are continuing and the amount of penalti
es to be imposed.  In the past, t he SED has imposed fines on the Utility ranging from $50,000 to $16.8 million for violations of electricand natural gas laws and regul
ations.   The CPUC can also open an OII and levy additional fines even a fter the SED has issued a citation.  
The Utility is unable to re
asonably estimate the amount or range of future charges as a result of SED investigations o r any proceedings that could be commenced inconnection with potential v

ending in 2011 through 2014 in excess of the amount adopted.  The decision permanently disallowed $120 million of that amount and orderedthat the remaini 
ng $576 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek recovery in a future proceeding.  The decision also establish
ed various cost caps that will increase the risk of overspend over the current ra te case cycle includ ing new one-way balancing accounts. As a result, in 2016, the Utility in
curred charges of $219 million for capital expenditures that the Utility believes are probable of disallowance based on the decision.  This included $134 million 
for 2011 through 2014 capital expenditures in excess of adopted amounts and $85 million for the Utility’s estimate of 2015 through2018 capital expenditures 
that are probable of exceeding authorized amounts.  Additional charges may be required in the future b ased on the Utility’s abil ity tomanage its capital sp

Contingencies  
Given the complexities of

r end of the range of estimated pro bable costs, unless an amount with in the range is a better estimate than any other amount.   Keyfactors 
that inform the develop ment of estimated costs includ e site feasibility studies and investigations, applicable remediation actions, operations a nd maint enance activities, post-

ws and regulations related to hazardous materials, waste, remediation activities, and other environmental requirements.  The Utilityassesses and monitors, 
on an ongoing basis, measures that may be necessary to comply with these laws and regulations and implements changes to its program asdeemed appropriate.  
The Utility’s remedia tion activities are overseen by the DTSC, several California regional water qu ality control boards, and va rious otherfederal, state, and lo
cal agencies. 
The Utility’s environment
al remediation liability at December 31, 2017 reflects its best estimate of pr obable future costs associated with its final remediation plan. Future costs will depend on many fa
ctors, including the extent of work to implement final remediation plans and the Utility’s required time frame for remediat ion. The Utility may incur act
ual costs in the future that are materially different than this estimate and such costs could have a material impact on results of operations,financial condition and 
cash flows during the period in which they are recorded.  At December 31, 2017 , the Utility expected to recover $ 725 million of itsenvironmental remediation liabil 
ity through various ratem aking mechanisms authorized by the CPUC.

Co
mpressor
 Station
 Sites
The Utility is legally r
esponsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gas compressor 
stations.  The Utility is also requir ed to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment. 
Topock
Site
 
The Utility’s remediation a
nd abatement efforts at the Topock site are subject to the regulatory authority of the DTSC and the DOI. In November 2015, the Utility submitted its final r
emediation design to the agencies for approval.  The Utility’s design proposes that the Utility construct an in-situ groundwater treatment systemto convert hexavalent ch
romium int o a non-toxic and non-soluble form of chromiu m.  On December 21, 2017 the DTSC issued its final environmental impactreport.  The environmenta
l impact report includes requirements related to conditions of work that have been anticipated or previously requir ed and are accounted for in the current enviro
nmental remediation liability .   The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Topock site may increase by as much as $ 289 million if the exten
t of contamination or necessary remediation is  greater than anticipated.  The costs associated with envi ronmental remediation at the Topock siteare expected to be re
covered through the HSM, where 90% of the costs are recovered in rates. 
Hinkley
Site
 
The Utility has been i 
mplementing interim remediation meas ures at the Hinkley site to reduce the mass of the chromium plume in groundwater and to monitor and control movement of the p
lume.  The Utility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the r egulatory authority of th e CaliforniaRegional Water Quality Contro
l Board, Lahontan Region.  In November 2015, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region adopted afinal clean-up and aba
tement order to contain and remediate the u nderground plume of hexavalen t chromium and the potential environmental impacts.  The finalorder states that the Ut
ility must continue and improve its remediation efforts, define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take other action.  Additionally,the final order requi
res setting plume capture requirements, requires establishing a monitoring and reporting program, and finalizes deadlines for the Utility to meetinterim cleanup targets. 
  The United States Geological Survey team is currently conducting a background study on the site to be tter define the chromium plumeboundaries.  The background study is expe
cted to be finalized in 2019.  The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Hinkley site may increase by as much as $ 
145 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated.  T he costs associated with environmental remediation atthe Hinkley site will not be r
ecovered through rates. 
Former
Manufactured
Gas
Plants
(“MGPs
”)  
Former m 
anufactured gas plants used coal and oil to produce gas for use by the Utility’s customers in the past .  The by-products and residues of this process were often disposed at the manuf
actured gas plants themselves.  The Utility has undertaken a program to manage the r esidues left behind as a result of the manufacturingprocess; many of the sites 
in the program have been addressed.  The Utility’s undiscounted futu re costs associated with MGP sites may increase by as much as $ 343 
million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated.  The costs associated with envi ronmental remediation at the MGPsites are recovered 
through the HSM, where 90% of the costs are recovered in rates .  
Utili
ty-Owned
Generation
Facilities
and
Third-Party
Disposal
Sites 
Utility-owned generatio
n facilities and third-party disposal sites are long-term projects that are undergoing a remediation process.  The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated wi
th Util ity-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites may increase by as much as $ 145 million if the extent ofcontamination or necessary
 remediation is greater than anticipated.  The environmental rem ediation costs associated with the Utility-owned generation f acilitiesand third-party disposal si
tes are recovered through the HSM , where 90% of the costs are r ecovered in rates .  
Fossil
Fuel-Fired
Generation
Sites
 
In 1998 the Utility divested i
ts generation power plan t business as part of genera tion deregulation. Although the Utility has sold its foss il-fueled power plants, theUtility has retained 
the environmental re mediation liability associated with each site .  The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with fossil fuel-fired generation sites may in
crease by as much as $ 106 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated.  The environmental remediation costs assoc
iated w i th the fossil fuel-fired sites will not be recovered through rates.

Nuclear
Insurance
 
The Utility is a member o
f NEIL, which is a mutual insurer owned by utilities with nuclear facilities.  NEIL provides insurance coverage for p roperty damages andbusiness interruption losses in
curred by the Utility if a nuclear event were to occur at the Utility’s two nucle ar generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retiredHumboldt Bay Unit 3.  
NEIL provides property damage and business in terruption coverage of up to $ 3.2 billion per nuclear incident and $2.6 billion per non- nuclear incident 
for Diablo Canyon .  Humboldt Bay Unit 3 has up to $ 131 million of coverage for nuclear and non-nuclear property damages. 
NEIL also provide 
s coverage for damages caused by acts of terrorism at nuclear power plants.  Certain acts of terro rism may be “certified” by the Secretary of the Treasury.  If damages ar
e caused by certified acts of terrorism, NEIL can obtain compensation from the federal government and will provide up to its full policylimit of $ 
3.2 billion for each insured loss.  In contrast, NEIL would treat all non-certif ied terrorist acts o ccurring within a 12-month period against one or morecommercial nucle
ar power plants insured by NEIL as one event and the owners of the affected plants would share the $ 3.2 billion policy limit amount.  
In addition to the nuclea
r ins urance the Utility ma intains through the   NEIL, the Utility also is a member of the   EMANI, which provides excess insurancecoverage for property da
mages and business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur at Diablo Canyon.   
If NEIL losses in any policy year 
exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment.     If NEIL were to exercise this assessment,as of December 31, 2017, the curr
ent maximum aggregate annual retrospect ive premium obligation for the Utility would be approximately $ 57 million.    EMANI provides $200 million for any one a
ccident and in the annual aggregate excess of the combined amount recoverable under the Utility’s NEIL policies.  IfEMANI losses in any po 
licy year exceed ac cumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment of approximately $ 3 million, as ofDecember 31, 2017. 
      
Under the Price-Anderson Act, public 
liability claims that arise from nuclear incid ents that occur at Diablo Canyon, and that occur during th e transportation ofmaterial to and fro
m Diablo Canyon are limited to $ 13.5 billion.  The Utility purchas ed the maximum available public liability insurance of $ 450 million forDiablo Canyon.  The balance of the $ 
13.5 billion of liability p rotection is provided under a loss-sharing program among utilities owning nuclear reactors.  TheUtility may be assessed up to $ 
255 million per nuclear incident und er this program, with payments in each year limited to a m aximum of $38 million perincident.  Both the maximum 
assessment and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years.  The next scheduled adjustment isdue on or before 
September 10, 2018 .  
The Price-Anderson Act does not apply to 
claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur during shipping of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel enricher to afuel fabricator or that occur at
 the fuel fabricator’s facility.  The Utility has a se parate policy that provides coverage for claims arising from some of these incidentsup to a maximum of $ 
450 million per incident.   In addition, the Utility has $ 53 million of liability insurance for Humboldt Bay Unit 3 and has a $ 500 millionindemnification fro
m the NRC for public liability arising from nuclear incidents, covering liabilities in excess of the lia bil ity insurance.

Claims
 
Various electricity supp
liers filed claims in the Utility’s proceeding filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking payment for energy supplied tothe Utility’s customers b
et ween May 2000 and June 2001.   While the FERC and judicial proceedings are pending, the Utility has pursued, and continues to pursue, settlements with e
lectricity suppliers.  The Utility has entered in to a number of settlement agreements with various electr icity suppliers to resolv e some ofthese disputed claims and 
to resolve the Utility’s refund claims agains t these electricity suppliers.   Under these settlement agreements, a mounts payable by the parties are, in some ins
tances, subject to adjustment based on the outcome of the various refund offset and interest issues being considered by the FER C. Generally, any net refu
nds, claim offsets, or other credits that the Utility receives from electricity suppliers either through settlement or through the conclus ion of the various FERC and judicial proce
edings are refunded to customers through rates in future periods.   
At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, r
espectively, the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected $ 243 million and $ 236 million in net claims withinDisputed claims and custome

ON
INTERNAL
CONTROL
OVER


 FINANCIAL
REPORTING 
Management of PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.     PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financialreporting and the prepar
ation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GA AP.     Internalcontrol over financial reporti
ng includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairlyreflect the trans
actions and dispositions of the assets of PG&E Corporati on and the Utility, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded asnecessary to permit pr
eparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance withauthorizations 
of management and dire ctors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial sta tements.  
Because of its inherent
 limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to future perio
ds are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of ch anges in conditions or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate. 
Management assessed the
 effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on the criteria established in Internal
Control— Integrated

of
Internal
Control
over
Financia
l
Reporting 
A company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reaso nable assurance regarding  the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes t 
hose policies and pr ocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are rec orded as necessary to perm it preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and director s of the company; and (3) provid e reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent 
limitations, intern al control over financial reporting may not prevent, or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in condi tions, or that the degree o f compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.
