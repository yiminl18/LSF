PART I
 
ITEM 1. Business.
General
We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of
advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system
integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial
applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2016, 71% of our $47.2 billion in net sales were from the U.S.
Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 59% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 27% were from international
customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 2% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our
main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, and homeland security.
We operate in an environment characterized by increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A
significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our
products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our
customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent
markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue
to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to
succeed without limiting our ability to return cash to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space Systems. We
organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.
Recent Developments
Divestiture of the Information Systems & Global Solutions Business
On August 16, 2016, we completed the divestiture of our Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business, which merged with a subsidiary of
Leidos Holdings, Inc. (Leidos), in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. This transaction represents the culmination of the strategic review of our government
information technology (IT) business and our technical services business performed in 2015 to explore whether the IS&GS business could achieve greater
growth and create more value for customers and stockholders outside of Lockheed Martin. The IS&GS business generated annual net sales of $5.6 billion in
2015 and $3.4 billion in 2016 through the August 16, 2016 divestiture date. As part of the transaction, we also completed an exchange offer that resulted in a
reduction of our common stock outstanding by approximately 9.4 million shares (approximately 3%). Based on an opinion of outside tax counsel, subject to
customary qualifications and based on factual representations, both the exchange offer and merger will qualify as tax-free transactions to us and our
stockholders, except to the extent that cash was paid to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares. Additionally, we received a one-time special cash
payment of $1.8 billion in connection with the divestiture of the IS&GS business. The operating results of the IS&GS business have been classified as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. See “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information about the divestiture of the IS&GS business.
AWE Management Limited
On August 24, 2016, our ownership interest in the AWE Management Limited (AWE) venture increased from 33% to 51% in exchange for our assuming
a more significant role in managing the operations of the venture. AWE operates the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program and generated net sales of
about $1.5 billion and net earnings of about $85 million in 2015. As a result of the increase in ownership interest, we now hold a 51% controlling interest in
AWE. Accordingly, we are required to consolidate AWE. AWE continues to be aligned under our Space Systems business segment. Prior to August 24, 2016,
we accounted for our investment in AWE using the equity method of accounting. See “Note 3 –Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the consolidation of AWE.

Aeronautics
In 2016, our Aeronautics business segment generated net sales of $17.8 billion, which represented 38% of our total consolidated net sales. Aeronautics’
customers include the military services and various other government agencies of the U.S. and other countries. In 2016, U.S. Government customers
accounted for 66% and international customers accounted for 34% of Aeronautics’ net sales. Net sales from Aeronautics’ combat aircraft products and
services represented 28% of our total consolidated net sales in both 2016 and 2015, and 26% in 2014.
Aeronautics is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft,
including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include:
 
• F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter – international multi-role, multi-variant, fifth generation stealth fighter;
• C-130 Hercules – international tactical airlifter;
• F-16 Fighting Falcon – low-cost, combat-proven, international multi-role fighter;
• F-22 Raptor – air dominance and multi-mission fifth generation stealth fighter; and
• C-5M Super Galaxy – strategic airlifter.
The F-35 program is our largest program, generating 23% of our total consolidated net sales, as well as 62% of Aeronautics’ net sales in 2016. The F-35
program consists of development contracts, multiple production contracts, and sustainment activities. The development contracts are being performed
concurrently with the production contracts. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts is used for complex programs to test aircraft,
shorten the time to field systems and achieve overall cost savings. We expect the System Development and Demonstration portion of the development
contracts will be substantially complete in 2017, with less significant efforts continuing into 2019. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many
years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,443 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy; commitments from our eight
international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. During 2016, we delivered 46 aircraft to our
U.S. and international partners, resulting in total deliveries of 200 production aircraft as of December 31, 2016. We have 173 production aircraft in backlog as
of December 31, 2016, including orders from our international partners. On November 2, 2016, the U.S. Government unilaterally definitized Low Rate Initial
Production (LRIP) 9, which covers 57 aircraft. For additional information on the F-35 program, including a discussion of the unilateral contract action, see
“Status of the F-35 Program” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Aeronautics produces and provides support and sustainment services for the C-130J Super Hercules, as well as upgrades and support services for the
legacy C-130 Hercules worldwide fleet. We delivered 24 C-130J aircraft in 2016, including five to international customers. We have 88 aircraft in our backlog
as of December 31, 2016 with advanced funding from customers for additional C-130J aircraft not currently in backlog. Our C-130J backlog extends into
2020.
Aeronautics currently produces F-16 aircraft for international customers with deliveries of new aircraft planned through 2017. Aeronautics also provides
service-life extension, modernization and other upgrade programs for our customers’ F-16 aircraft. We delivered 12 F-16 aircraft in 2016. As of December 31,
2016, we have eight F-16 aircraft in backlog with all deliveries expected in 2017. Although existing production contracts provide for deliveries of F-16
aircraft through late 2017, we continue to seek international opportunities to deliver additional aircraft beyond 2017. Aeronautics also provides service-life
extension, modernization and other upgrade programs for our customers’ F-16 aircraft, with existing contracts continuing for several years.
While production and deliveries of F-22 aircraft were completed in 2012, Aeronautics continues to provide modernization and sustainment activities for
the U.S. Air Force’s F-22 aircraft fleet. The modernization program comprises upgrading existing systems requirements, developing new systems
requirements, adding capabilities and enhancing the performance of the weapon systems. The sustainment program consists of sustaining the weapon systems
of the F-22 fleet, providing training systems, customer support, integrated support planning, supply chain management, aircraft modifications and heavy
maintenance, systems engineering and support products.
Aeronautics provides sustainment services for the existing U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy fleet and modernization activities to convert 52 C-5 Galaxy
aircraft to the C-5M Super Galaxy configuration. These modernization activities include the installation of new engines, landing gear and systems and other
improvements that enable a shorter takeoff, a higher climb rate, an increased cargo load and longer flight range. As of December 31, 2016, we had delivered
41 C-5M aircraft under these modernization activities, including nine C-5M aircraft delivered in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we have 11 C-5 aircraft in
backlog with backlog extending into 2018.

In addition to the above aircraft programs, Aeronautics is involved in advanced development programs incorporating innovative design and rapid
prototype applications. Our Advanced Development Programs (ADP) organization, also known as Skunk Works®, is focused on future systems, including
unmanned aerial systems and next generation capabilities for advanced strike, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, situational awareness and air
mobility. We continue to explore technology advancement and insertion in our existing aircraft. We also are involved in numerous network-enabled activities
that allow separate systems to work together to increase effectiveness and we continue to invest in new technologies to maintain and enhance competitiveness
in military aircraft design, development and production.
Missiles and Fire Control
In 2016, our MFC business segment generated net sales of $6.6 billion, which represented 14% of our total consolidated net sales. MFC’s customers
include the military services, principally the U.S. Army, and various government agencies of the U.S. and other countries, as well as commercial and other
customers. In 2016, U.S. Government customers accounted for 61%, international customers accounted for 37% and U.S. commercial and other customers
accounted for 2% of MFC’s net sales.
MFC provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems;
mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management
solutions. MFC’s major programs include:

several fixed-wing aircraft and LANTIRN is a combined navigation and targeting system for several fixed-wing aircraft. Both Sniper and LANTIRN are
produced for the U.S. Air Force and international customers.
• The Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services (SOF CLSS) program provides logistics support services to the special operations
forces of the U.S. military. In 2016 we submitted a bid for the Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) contract, which is
a competitive follow-on contract to SOF CLSS. We anticipate an award decision on the follow-on contract in mid-2017.
Rotary and Mission Systems
In 2016, our RMS business segment, previously known as Mission Systems and Training (MST), generated net sales of $13.5 billion, which represented
28% of our total consolidated net sales. RMS’ customers include the military services, principally the U.S. Army and Navy, and various government agencies
of the U.S. and other countries, as well as commercial and other customers. In 2016, U.S. Government customers accounted for 68%, international customers
accounted for 28% and U.S. commercial and other customers accounted for 4% of RMS’ net sales.
RMS provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and commercial helicopters; ship and submarine mission and combat
systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; the Littoral Combat Ship

Table of Contents
Competition
Our broad portfolio of products and services competes both domestically and internationally against products and services of other large aerospace and
defense companies, as well as numerous smaller competitors. We often form teams with our competitors in efforts to provide our customers with the best mix
of capabilities to address specific requirements. In some areas of our business, customer requirements are changing to encourage expanded competition and
increasingly what would have previously been competed as a single large procurement is being broken into multiple smaller procurements. Principal factors
of competition include the value of our products and services to the customer; technical and management capability; the ability to develop and implement
complex, integrated system architectures; total cost of ownership; our demonstrated ability to execute and perform against contract requirements; and our
ability to provide timely solutions. Technological advances in such areas as: additive manufacturing, cloud computing, advanced materials, autonomy,
robotics, and big data and new business models such as commercial access to space are enabling new factors of competition for both traditional and
non-traditional competitors.
The competition for international sales is generally subject to U.S. Government stipulations (e.g., export restrictions, market access, technology transfer,
industrial cooperation and contracting practices). We may compete against U.S. and non-U.S. companies (or teams) for contract awards by international
governments. International competitions also may be subject to different laws or contracting practices of international governments that may affect how we
structure our bid for the procurement. In many international procurements, the purchasing government’s relationship with the U.S. and its industrial
cooperation programs are also important factors in determining the outcome of a competition. It is common for international customers to require contractors
to comply with their industrial cooperation regulations, sometimes referred to as offset requirements, and we have entered into foreign offset agreements as
part of securing some international business. For more information concerning offset agreements, see “Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Patents
We routinely apply for and own a substantial number of U.S. and international patents related to the products and services we provide. In addition to
owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. The U.S. Government has licenses in our
patents that are developed in performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for
government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills also make an important contribution to our business. Although our
intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business, we do not believe that any existing patent, license or other
intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on our business taken as a whole.
Raw Materials and Seasonality
Some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials. Historically, we have been successful in obtaining the raw materials and other supplies
needed in our manufacturing processes. We seek to manage raw materials supply risk through long-term contracts and by maintaining an acceptable level of
the key materials in inventories.
Aluminum and titanium are important raw materials used in certain of our Aeronautics and Space Systems programs. Long-term agreements have helped
enable a continued supply of aluminum and titanium. Carbon fiber is an important ingredient in composite materials used in our Aeronautics programs, such
as the F-35 aircraft. We have been advised by some suppliers that pricing and the timing of availability of materials in some commodities markets can
fluctuate widely. These fluctuations may negatively affect the price and availability of certain materials. While we do not anticipate material problems
regarding the supply of our raw materials and believe that we have taken appropriate measures to mitigate these variations, if key materials become
unavailable or if pricing fluctuates widely in the future, it could result in delay of one or more of our programs, increased costs or reduced operating profits.
No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our sales between accounting periods,
including the timing of government awards, the availability of government funding, product deliveries and customer acceptance.
Government Contracts and Regulations
Our business is heavily regulated. We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, principally all branches of the U.S. military and
NASA. We also contract with similar government authorities in other countries and they
 
7
Table of Contents
regulate our international efforts. Additionally, our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with U.S. and international regulations governing
production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety.
We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government and other
governments’ contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things:
 
• require certification and disclosure of all cost or pricing data in connection with certain types of contract negotiations;
• impose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;
• impose acquisition regulations, which may change or be replaced over time, that define allowable and unallowable costs, the allocability of costs, and
otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain U.S. Government and foreign contracts;
• require specific security controls to protect U.S. Government controlled unclassified information and restrict the use and dissemination of information
classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services and technical data; and
• require the review and approval of contractor business systems, defined in the regulations as: (i) Accounting System; (ii) Estimating System; (iii) Earned
Value Management System, for managing cost and schedule performance on certain complex programs; (iv) Purchasing System; (v) Material Management
and Accounting System, for planning, controlling and accounting for the acquisition, use, issuing and disposition of material; and (vi) Property
Management System.
The U.S. Government and other governments may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts either at its convenience or for default
based on our performance. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we generally are protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on
the contract and profit on those costs. If a contract is terminated for default, we generally are entitled to payments for our work that has been accepted by the
U.S. Government or other governments; however, the U.S. Government and other governments could make claims to reduce the contract value or recover its
procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. For more information regarding the U.S. Government’s and other governments’ right to terminate
our contracts, see Item 1A – Risk Factors. For more information regarding government contracting laws and regulations, see Item 1A – Risk Factors as well
as “Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations. For more information on the risks of doing work internationally, see Item 1A – Risk Factors. Additionally, the U.S. Government may also enter
into unilateral contract actions, which they recently did on the F-35 program. This can affect our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms.
A portion of our business is classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified contracts
are included in our consolidated financial statements. The business risks associated with classified contracts historically have not differed materially from
those of our other U.S. Government contracts. Our internal controls addressing the financial reporting of classified contracts are consistent with our internal
controls for our non-classified contracts.
Our operations are subject to and affected by various federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations regarding the
discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise regulating the protection of the environment. While the extent of our financial exposure cannot in all
cases be reasonably estimated, the costs of environmental compliance have not had, and we do not expect that these costs will have, a material adverse effect
on our earnings, financial position and cash flow, primarily because most of our environmental costs are allowable in establishing the price of our products
and services under our contracts with the U.S. Government. For information regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that we
believe are required for remediation or cleanup to the extent that they are probable and estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental Matters”
in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and
Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also the discussion of environmental matters within Item 1A – Risk Factors.
Backlog
At December 31, 2016, our backlog was $96.2 billion compared with $94.8 billion at December 31, 2015. Backlog at December 31, 2015 excludes
$4.8 billion related to the IS&GS business, which we divested in 2016. Backlog is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are
made. Approximately $34 billion, or 35%, of our backlog at December 31, 2016 is expected to be converted into sales in 2017.

Our backlog includes both funded (firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the
customer) and unfunded (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated) amounts. We do not include unexercised options or potential orders under
indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity agreements in our backlog. If any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be
reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts. Funded backlog was $66.0 billion at December 31, 2016, as compared to $67.6 billion
at December 31, 2015. Funded backlog at December 31, 2015 excludes $3.1 billion related to the IS&GS business, which we divested in 2016. For backlog
related to each of our business segments, see “Business Segment Results of Operations” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.
Research and Development
We conduct research and development (R&D) activities under customer-sponsored contracts and with our own independent R&D funds. Our
independent R&D costs include basic research, applied research, development, systems and other concept formulation studies. Generally, these costs are
allocated among all contracts and programs in progress under U.S. Government contractual arrangements. Costs we incur under customer-sponsored R&D
programs pursuant to contracts are included in net sales and cost of sales. Under certain arrangements in which a customer shares in product development
costs, our portion of the unreimbursed costs is expensed as incurred in cost of sales. Independent R&D costs charged to cost of sales were $988 million in
2016, $817 million in 2015, and $733 million in 2014. See “Research and development and similar costs” in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies”
included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Employees
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 97,000 employees, about 92% of whom were located in the U.S. Approximately 21% of our employees
are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. A number of our existing collective bargaining agreements expire in any given year.
Historically, we have been successful in negotiating renewals to expiring agreements without any material disruption of operating activities. Management
considers employee relations to be good.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.
An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business,
but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material effect on our
operating results, financial position, or cash flows. You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase our common stock or debt securities.
We depend heavily on contracts with the U.S. Government for a substantial portion of our business.
We derived 71% of our total net sales from the U.S. Government in 2016, including 59% from the Department of Defense (DoD). We expect to continue
to derive most of our sales from work performed under U.S. Government contracts. Those contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of
Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may extend over many years.
Consequently, contracts are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur
costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the
contract.
As discussed within the “Industry Considerations” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the U.S.
Government continues to face significant deficit reduction pressures and it is likely that discretionary spending by the U.S. Government will remain
constrained for a number of years. Under such conditions, large or complex programs, which consist of multiple contracts and phases, are potentially subject
to increased scrutiny.
There is also uncertainty regarding actions that may be taken by the new Presidential Administration in light of recent criticisms of the F-35 program and
other large defense programs. President Trump has publicly expressed concerns over past cost overruns and delays in the program as well as overall program
cost and has publicly requested that a competitor price out an alternative. Defense Secretary Mattis recently ordered a review of the program, including a
comparison review of the F-35C carrier variant with a fourth generation alternative. Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer has had discussions
with President Trump on the importance of the F-35 program and our commitment to cut costs. However, we may continue to face pressure to reduce costs
from the new Presidential Administration relating to the F-35 program and ongoing contract negotiations.
The F-35 is our largest program and represented 23% of our total net sales in 2016 and is expected to represent a higher percentage of our sales in future
years. A decision to cut spending or reduce planned orders would have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Given the size and complexity of the
F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD,
Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner
performance, software development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, successfully negotiating and receiving
funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft. Additionally, the
U.S. Government may also enter into unilateral contract actions, which they recently did on the F-35 program. This unilateral contract action obligates us to
perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. Government. Unilateral contract actions could negatively affect profit and cash flows, and establish
a precedent for future contracts.
Based upon our diverse range of defense, homeland security and information technology products and services, we believe that this makes it less likely
that cuts in any specific contract or program will have a long-term effect on our business. However, termination of multiple or large programs or contracts
could adversely affect our business and future financial performance. Potential changes in funding priorities may afford new or additional opportunities for
our businesses in terms of existing, follow-on or replacement programs. While we would expect to compete and be well positioned as the incumbent on
existing programs, we may not be successful or the replacement programs may be funded at lower levels.

We are subject to a number of procurement laws and regulations. Our business and our reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to comply
with these laws.
We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts.
Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. A violation of
specific laws and regulations, by us, our employees, others working on our behalf, a supplier or a venture partner, could harm our reputation and result in the
imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contracts, loss of our ability to
export products or services and civil or criminal investigations or proceedings.
In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are different from those typically found in commercial transactions. For
example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts either at its convenience or for default based on our
performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items,
reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would
have resulted in a loss.
Upon termination for convenience of a cost-reimbursable contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee.
Allowable costs would include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to
the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation. We attempt to ensure that adequate funds are available by
notifying the customer when its estimated costs, including those associated with a possible termination for convenience, approach levels specified as being
allotted to its programs. As funds are typically appropriated on a fiscal-year basis and as the costs of a termination for convenience may exceed the costs of
continuing a program in a given fiscal year, occasionally programs do not have sufficient funds appropriated to cover the termination costs were the
government to terminate them for convenience. Under such circumstances, the U.S. Government could assert that it is not required to appropriate additional
funding.
A termination arising out of our default may expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and
orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime
contract under which we are a subcontractor, notwithstanding the quality of our services as a subcontractor. In the case of termination for default, the U.S.
Government could make claims to reduce the contract value or recover its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. However, under such
circumstances we have rights and remedial actions under laws and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
In addition, certain of our U.S. Government contracts span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the
right not to exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period for various reasons. However, the U.S. Government may exercise option periods,
even for contracts for which it is expected that our costs may exceed the contract price or ceiling.
U.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and various agency Inspectors
General, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, its cost structure, its
business systems and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. Government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain
payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. Additionally, any costs found to be misclassified may be subject to repayment. We
have unaudited and/or unsettled incurred cost claims related to past years, which places risk on our ability to issue final billings on contracts for which
authorized and appropriated funds may be expiring.
If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including
reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, penalties, fines and suspension, or
prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made
against us. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business.
Our profitability and cash flow may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs, our performance, our ability to control costs and evolving
U.S. Government procurement policies.
Our profitability and cash flow may vary materially depending on the types of government contracts undertaken, the nature of products produced or
services performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of
performance at which the right to receive fees is determined, particularly under award and incentive-fee contracts.

Our backlog includes a variety of contract types that are intended to address changing risk and reward profiles as a program matures. Contract types
include cost-reimbursable, fixed-price incentive-fee, fixed-price and time-and-materials contracts. Contracts for development programs with complex design
and technical challenges are typically cost-reimbursable. Under cost-reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may
be fixed or performance-based. In these cases, the associated financial risks primarily relate to a reduction in fees and the program could be cancelled if cost,
schedule or technical performance issues arise.
Other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production (e.g., LRIP contracts), which includes the challenge of starting and
stabilizing a manufacturing production and test line while the final design is being validated. These generally are cost-reimbursable or fixed-price
incentive-fee contracts. Under a fixed-price incentive-fee contract, the allowable costs incurred are eligible for reimbursement but are subject to a cost-share
arrangement, which affects profitability. Generally, if our costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulations, we may
not be able to obtain reimbursement for all costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated.
There are also contracts for production, as well as operations and maintenance of the delivered products, that have the challenge of achieving a stable
production and delivery rate, while maintaining operability of the product after delivery. These contracts are mainly fixed-price, although some operations and
maintenance contracts are time-and-materials type. Under fixed-price contracts, we receive a fixed price regardless of the actual costs we incur. We have to
absorb any costs in excess of the fixed price. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain
expenses.
The failure to perform to customer expectations and contract requirements may result in reduced fees or losses and affect our financial performance in
that period. Under each type of contract, if we are unable to control costs, our operating results could be adversely affected, particularly if we are unable to
justify an increase in contract value to our customers. Cost overruns or the failure to perform on existing programs also may adversely affect our ability to
retain existing programs and win future contract awards.
The U.S. Government is currently pursuing and implementing policies that could negatively impact our profitability. Changes in procurement policy
favoring more incentive-based fee arrangements, different award fee criteria or government contract negotiation offers based upon the customer’s view of
what our costs should be (as compared to our actual costs) may affect the predictability of our profit rates. The U.S. Government’s unilateral contract action
definitizing the LRIP 9 F-35 contract reflected differing U.S. Government and Lockheed Martin views as to costs, entitlement to performance-based payments
and profitability and could negatively impact the profitability and cash flows of LRIP 9, LRIP 10 (which remains an undefinitized contract) and future
production contracts. Our customers are subject to pressures that may result in a change in contract types referenced above earlier in a program’s maturity
than is traditional. An example of this is the use of fixed-price incentive-fee contracts for recent LRIP contracts on the F-35 program while the development
contract is being performed concurrently. Our customers also may pursue non-traditional contract provisions in negotiation of contracts. For example,
changes resulting from the F-35 development contract may need to be implemented on the production contracts (including the LRIP contracts), a concept
referred to as concurrency, which may require us to pay for a portion of the concurrency costs. An example of customer budget pressures includes the U.S.
Government requiring that bid and proposal costs be included in general and administrative costs, rather than charged directly to contracts in certain
circumstances.
Other policies could negatively impact our working capital and cash flow. For example, the government has expressed a preference for requiring progress
payments rather than performance based payments on new fixed-price contracts, which if implemented, delays our ability to recover a significant amount of
costs incurred on a contract and thus affects the timing of our cash flows.
Increased competition and bid protests in a budget-constrained environment may make it more difficult to maintain our financial performance and
customer relationships.
We are experiencing increased competition while, at the same time, our customers are facing budget constraints, trying to do more with less by cutting
costs, identifying more affordable solutions, performing certain work internally rather than hiring a contractor, and reducing product development cycles. It is
critical we maintain strong customer relationships and seek to understand the priorities of their requirements in this price competitive environment.
In international sales, we face substantial competition from both U.S. manufacturers and international manufacturers whose governments sometimes
provide research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products. Additionally, our competitors are also focusing on
increasing their international sales to partially mitigate the
 
12
Table of Contents
effect of reduced U.S. Government budgets. To remain competitive, we consistently must maintain strong customer relationships and provide superior
performance, advanced technology solutions and service at an affordable cost and with the agility that our customers require to satisfy their mission
objectives.
A substantial portion of our business is awarded through competitive bidding. The U.S. Government increasingly has relied upon competitive contract
award types, including indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity and other multi-award contracts, which have the potential to create pricing pressure and
increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bids and proposals. In addition, multi-award contracts require that we make sustained efforts to obtain
task orders under the contract. The competitive bidding process entails substantial costs and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that
may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors. Additionally, the former IS&GS programs we moved to RMS and Space Systems in the fourth
quarter of 2015 and retained could experience increased pricing pressures which could have a negative impact on our ability to win future follow-on
contracts. Following award, we may encounter significant expenses, delays, contract modifications or bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program
awards. Unsuccessful bidders are more frequently protesting in the hope of being awarded a subcontract for a portion of the work in return for withdrawing
the protest. Bid protests could result in significant expenses to us, contract modifications or even loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not
result in the loss of a contract award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and, as a result, delay our recognizing sales. We
also may not be successful in our efforts to protest or challenge any bids for contracts that were not awarded to us and we could incur significant time and
expense in such efforts.
We are the prime contractor on most of our contracts and if our subcontractors, suppliers or teaming agreement or venture partners fail to perform
their obligations, our performance and our ability to win future business could be harmed.
For most of our contracts we rely on other companies to provide materials, major components and products, and to perform a portion of the services that
we provide to our customers. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, ventures or supply agreements with other companies upon
which we rely (contracting parties). There is a risk that we may have disputes with our contracting parties, including disputes regarding the quality and
timeliness of work performed, the workshare provided to that party, customer concerns about the other party’s performance, our failure to extend existing task
orders or issue new task orders, or our hiring the personnel of a subcontractor, teammate or venture partner or vice versa. In addition, changes in the economic
environment, including defense budgets and constraints on available financing, may adversely affect the financial stability of our contracting parties and their
ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a timely basis as might their inability to perform profitably in the current
highly competitive and budget constrained environment. A failure, for whatever reason, by one or more of our contracting parties to provide the agreed-upon
supplies or perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis, according to specifications, or at all may affect our ability to perform our obligations and
require that we transition the work to other companies. Contracting party performance deficiencies may result in additional costs or delays in product
deliveries and affect our operating results and could result in a customer terminating our contract for default or convenience. A default termination could
expose us to liability and affect our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. Additionally, our efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and
improve the affordability of our products and services could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain suppliers.
International sales may pose different risks.
In 2016, 27% of our total net sales were from international customers. We have a strategy to grow international sales over the next several years,
inclusive of sales of F-35 aircraft to our international partners and other countries. International sales are subject to numerous political and economic factors,
regulatory requirements, significant competition, taxation, and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. Our exposure to such risks
increased as a result of our acquisition of Sikorsky and our increased ownership interest in AWE and may further increase if our international sales grow as
we anticipate.
Our international business is conducted through foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government or by direct commercial sales
(DCS) with international customers. In 2016, approximately 66% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 34% were DCS. These
transaction types differ as FMS transactions represent sales by the U.S. Government to international governments and our contract with the U.S. Government
is subject to FAR. By contrast, DCS transactions represent sales directly to another international government or commercial customer. All sales to
international customers are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to anti-corruption, import-
export control, technology transfer restrictions, taxation, repatriation of earnings, exchange
 
13
Table of Contents
controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. While we
have stringent policies in place to comply with such laws and regulations, failure by us, our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these
laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including suspension, debarment from bidding for or performing government
contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We frequently team with international subcontractors and
suppliers who are also exposed to similar risks.
While international sales, whether contracted as FMS or DCS, present risks that are different and potentially greater than those encountered in our U.S.
business, DCS with international customers may impose even greater risks. DCS transactions involve commercial relationships with parties with whom we
have less familiarity and where there may be significant cultural differences. Additionally, international procurement rules and regulations, contract laws and
regulations, and contractual terms differ from those in the U.S. and are less familiar to us. International regulations may be interpreted by foreign courts less
bound by precedent and with more discretion; these interpretations frequently have terms less favorable to us than the FAR. Export and import, tax and
currency risk also may be increased for DCS with international customers. While these risks are potentially greater than those encountered in our U.S.
business, we seek to price our products and services commensurate with the risk profile on DCS with international customers.
Our international business is highly sensitive to changes in regulations, political environments or security risks that may affect our ability to conduct
business outside of the U.S., including those regarding investment, procurement, taxation and repatriation of earnings. Our international business also may be
impacted by changes in foreign national priorities, foreign government budgets, global economic conditions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. Sales of military products are also affected by defense budgets and U.S. foreign policy. Additionally, the timing of orders from our international
customers can be less predictable than for our U.S. customers and may lead to fluctuations in the amount reported each year for our international sales.
In conjunction with defense procurements, some international customers require contractors to comply with industrial cooperation regulations, including
entering into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements. Offset agreements may require in-country purchases, technology
transfers, local manufacturing support, investments in foreign joint ventures and financial support projects as an incentive or as a condition to a contract
award. In some countries, these offset agreements may require the establishment of a venture with a local company, which must control the venture. The costs
to satisfy our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our profitability and cash flows. The
ability to recover investments that we make is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products
and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. In these and other situations, we could be liable for violations of law for actions taken by these
entities such as laws related to anti-corruption, import and export, taxation, and anti-boycott restrictions. Offset agreements generally extend over several
years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are typically subjective and can be
outside our control.
Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.
We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our
company sensitive information, denial-of-service attacks, threats to the security of our facilities and employees, and threats from terrorist acts, as do our
customers, suppliers, subcontractors and venture partners. We may experience similar security threats at customer sites that we operate and manage.
The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target us because
we protect national security information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the
adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future
incident cannot be predicted.
Although we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, venture partners and acquisitions to seek to minimize the impact of cyber
threats, other security threats, or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may affect the security of our
information. These entities have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards, and their relationships with government contractors, such as
Lockheed Martin, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face.
The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Additionally, some cyber
technologies we develop under contract for our customers, particularly those related to
 
14
Table of Contents
homeland security, may raise potential liabilities related to intellectual property and civil liberties, including privacy concerns, which may not be fully insured
or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the services we provide to our customers, our
future financial results, our reputation, or our stock price. Additionally, such events could result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from our
research and development efforts or other intellectual property; early obsolescence of our products and services; or contractual penalties.
If we fail to manage acquisitions, divestitures, equity investments and other transactions successfully or if acquired entities or equity investments fail
to perform as expected, our financial results, business and future prospects could be harmed.
In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate companies, and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions,
divestitures, ventures and equity investments. We seek to identify acquisition or investment opportunities that will expand or complement our existing
products and services or customer base, at attractive valuations. We often compete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we must conduct
due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies; negotiate transaction terms; complete and close complex transactions; integrate
acquired companies and employees; and realize anticipated operating synergies efficiently and effectively. Acquisition, divestiture, venture and investment
transactions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. Unidentified or
identified but un-indemnified pre-closing liabilities could affect our future financial results, particularly successor liability under procurement laws and
regulations such as the False Claims Act or Truth in Negotiations Act, anti-corruption, tax, import-export and technology transfer laws which provide for civil
and criminal penalties and the potential for debarment. We also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges,
expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, employee retention, transaction-related or other litigation, and other liabilities. Any of the foregoing
could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Ventures, or noncontrolling equity investments, operate under shared control with other parties. Under the equity method of accounting for
nonconsolidated ventures and investments, we recognize our share of the operating profit of these ventures in our results of operations. Our operating results
may be affected by the performance of businesses over which we do not exercise control, which includes the inability to influence strategic decisions that may
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our joint ventures face many of the same risks and uncertainties as we do. The
most significant impact of our equity investments is in our Space Systems business segment where approximately 25% of its 2016 operating profit was
derived from its share of earnings from equity method investees, particularly that in United Launch Alliance (ULA). Approximately 3% and 7% of our
Aeronautics and RMS business segments’ operating profit was derived from their shares of earnings from equity method investees, including their share in
Advanced Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center LLC venture (AMMROC).
The acquired Sikorsky business may underperform relative to our expectations, the transaction may cause our financial results to differ from our
expectations or the expectations of the investment community and we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated
synergies.
On November 6, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Sikorsky. We believe that we will benefit from the integration of our products and technologies
with those of the Sikorsky business and realize synergies and potential for long-term growth, as well as expanded capabilities and customer relationships as a
result of the acquisition. However, we may not be able to capture anticipated synergies, tax benefits, cost savings, and business opportunities in the time frame
anticipated, or at all. Changes to the Federal statutory tax rate could have an impact on the tax benefits we expect in connection with the acquisition. Due to
the recent acquisition and valuation, the carrying value and fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit are currently closely aligned. Therefore, any business
deterioration, contract cancelations or terminations, or market pressures could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections
and could cause goodwill to be impaired. Additionally, Sikorsky may not perform as expected, or demand for its products may be adversely affected by global
economic conditions, including oil and gas trends that are outside of their control.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of
our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. As further described,
in Part II Item 9A “Controls and Procedures” management has concluded that, because of a material weakness in internal controls within Sikorsky’s processes
(specifically, Sikorsky did not adequately identify,
 
15
Table of Contents
design and implement appropriate process-level controls for its processes and appropriate information technology controls for its information technology
systems), which we acquired on November 6, 2015 and which operates as a business unit of our RMS business segment, our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2016. We have and we will continue to enhance our controls at our Sikorsky business unit and we expect
that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2017. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will
be successful or that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Material inaccuracies in our financial statements would
impair their value to management and our Board of Directors in making decisions as to the operation of our business, could impair our reputation and cause
investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the
trading price of our stock and our access to capital.
The divestiture of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business may not achieve the intended benefits and may expose us to potential risks
and liabilities.
We completed the divestiture of our IS&GS business on August 16, 2016, which merged with a subsidiary of Leidos Holdings Inc. (Leidos), in a Reverse
Morris Trust transaction. As part of the transaction, we also completed an exchange offer that resulted in a reduction of our outstanding common stock. We
undertook the divestiture because we believed that this business could achieve greater growth and create more value for customers and stockholders outside
of Lockheed Martin and that we could benefit from greater strategic focus of our resources and management efforts. We may not benefit as expected from the
increased focus on our core business, strategic programs and objectives made possible by the split-off or from the reduced exposure to a shorter product cycle
services business. Additionally, the value of the transaction may also be reduced by potential liabilities related to post-closing adjustments and indemnities,
which could adversely affect our results of operations.
If the divestiture of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the
divestiture are determined to be taxable in whole or in part, we and our stockholders may incur significant tax liabilities.
In connection with the divestiture of our IS&GS business, we obtained opinions of outside tax counsel that the merger and exchange offer will qualify as
tax-free transactions to us and our stockholders, except to the extent that cash was paid to Lockheed Martin stockholders in lieu of fractional shares. We have
not sought or obtained a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on each of the tax consequences of the transaction. An opinion of counsel is not
binding on the IRS or the courts, which may disagree with the opinion. In addition, the tax opinions are subject to customary qualifications and based on
factual representations. Even if the merger and exchange offer otherwise qualified as tax-free transactions, they may become taxable to us if certain events
occur that affect either Lockheed Martin or Leidos. While Leidos has agreed not to take certain actions that could cause the transactions not to qualify as
tax-free transactions and is generally obligated to indemnify us against any tax consequences if it breaches this agreement, the potential tax liabilities could
have a material adverse effect on us if we were not entitled to indemnification or if the indemnification obligations were not fulfilled. If the merger or
exchange offer were determined to be taxable, we could be subject to a substantial tax liability, and each U.S. holder of our common stock who participated in
the exchange offer could be treated as exchanging the Lockheed Martin shares surrendered for Abacus shares in a taxable transaction.
There can be no assurance that we will continue to increase our dividend or to repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels.
The payment of cash dividends and share repurchases is subject to limitations under applicable law and the discretion of our Board of Directors and is
determined in light of then current conditions, including earnings, other operating results and capital requirements. Decreases in asset values or increases in
liabilities, including liabilities associated with benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes, can reduce stockholders’ equity. A deficit in
stockholders’ equity could limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases under Maryland Law in the future. In addition, the timing and
amount of share repurchases under board approved share repurchase plans is within the discretion of management and will depend on many factors, including
results of operations, capital requirements as well as applicable law.
Our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance.
A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced defense and technology products and systems. New
technologies may be untested or unproven. Failure of some of these products and services could result in extensive loss of life or property damage.
Accordingly, we also may incur liabilities that are unique to our products and services, including combat and air mobility aircraft, missile and space systems,
command and control

systems, cybersecurity, homeland security and training programs. In some but not all circumstances, we may be entitled to certain legal protections or
indemnifications from our customers, either through U.S. Government indemnifications under Public Law 85-804 or the Price-Anderson Act, qualification of
our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, contractual
provisions or otherwise. We endeavor to obtain insurance coverage from established insurance carriers to cover these risks and liabilities. The amount of
insurance coverage that we maintain may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Existing coverage may be cancelled while we remain exposed to
the risk, and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. For example, we are limited in the amount of insurance
we can obtain to cover certain natural hazards, such as earthquakes. We have significant operations in geographic areas prone to this risk, such as Sunnyvale,
California. Even if insurance coverage is available, we may not be able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us. Additionally, disputes with
insurance carriers over coverage terms or the insolvency of one or more of our insurance carriers may significantly affect the amount or timing of our cash
flows.
Substantial costs resulting from an accident; failure of or defect in our products or services; natural catastrophe or other incident; or liability arising from
our products and services in excess of any legal protection, indemnity, and our insurance coverage (or for which indemnity or insurance is not available or not
obtained) could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows, or operating results. Any accident, failure of, or defect in our products or services, even
if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete
effectively. It also could affect the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future.
Pension funding and costs are dependent on several economic assumptions which if changed may cause our future earnings and cash flow to
fluctuate significantly as well as affect the affordability of our products and services.
Many of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees.
The impact of these plans on our U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for
our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in
several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, rates of return on plan assets, and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also
known as mortality), employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. Changes in these factors, including actual returns on plan assets, may also
affect our plan funding, cash flow and stockholders’ equity. In addition, the funding of our plans and recovery of costs on our contracts, as described below,
also may be subject to changes caused by legislative or regulatory actions. We have taken certain actions over the last few years to mitigate the impact the
plans may have on our cash flows and earnings, including amendments made in June 2014 to a significant portion of our qualified and nonqualified defined
benefit pension plans for non-union employees to freeze future retirement benefits. However, the impact of these actions on our cash flow and earnings may
be less than anticipated or may be offset by other factors such as changes in actuarial assumptions and plan asset investment returns.
With regard to cash flow, we have made substantial cash contributions to our plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). We generally are able to recover these contributions related to our plans as allowable
costs on our U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, but there is a lag between when we contribute cash to our plans under pension funding rules and
recover it under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). Effective February 2012, the CAS rules were revised to harmonize the measurement
and period assignment of the pension cost allocable to government contracts with the PPA (CAS Harmonization). In 2013, the cost impact of CAS
Harmonization started being phased in with the goal of better aligning the CAS pension cost and ERISA funding requirements being fully achieved in 2017.
The enactment of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased the interest rate assumption used to
determine our CAS pension costs, which has the effect of lowering the recovery of pension contributions during the affected periods as it decreases our CAS
pension costs.
For more information on how these factors could impact earnings, financial position, cash flow and stockholders’ equity, see “Critical Accounting
Policies – Postretirement Benefit Plans” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and “Note 11 –
 Postretirement Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Environmental costs could affect our future earnings as well as the affordability of our products and services.
Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations. We are involved
in environmental remediation at some of our facilities, some of our former facilities, and at
 
17
Table of Contents
third-party-owned sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party. In addition, we could be affected by future regulations imposed or
claims asserted in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment or natural resources. We have an ongoing comprehensive
sustainability program to reduce the effects of our operations on the environment.
We manage and have managed various U.S. Government-owned facilities, and portions of U.S. Government-owned facilities, on behalf of the U.S.
Government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs historically have been the responsibility of the U.S. Government. We have
relied, and continue to rely with respect to past practices, upon U.S. Government funding to pay such costs, notwithstanding efforts by some U.S.
Government representatives to limit this responsibility. Although the U.S. Government remains responsible for capital and operating costs associated with
environmental compliance, responsibility for fines and penalties associated with environmental noncompliance typically is borne by either the U.S.
Government or the contractor, depending on the contract and the relevant facts. Some environmental laws include criminal provisions. An environmental law
conviction could affect our ability to be awarded future, or perform existing, U.S. Government contracts.
We have incurred and will continue to incur liabilities under various federal, state, local and foreign statutes for environmental protection and
remediation. The extent of our financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated at this time. Among the variables management must assess in
evaluating costs associated with these cases and remediation sites generally are the status of site assessment, extent of the contamination, impacts on natural
resources, changing cost estimates, evolution of technologies used to remediate the site, continually evolving governmental environmental standards and cost
allowability issues, including varying efforts by the U.S. Government to limit allowability of our costs in resolving liability at third party-owned sites. For
information regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for remediation or cleanup to the extent probable
and estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies –Environmental Matters” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” of our consolidated financial statements.
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty.
Our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. As required
by GAAP, we estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably
estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our
assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements. For a description of our
current legal proceedings, see Item 3 – Legal Proceedings and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce.
Many of the products and services we provide are highly engineered and involve sophisticated technologies, with related complex manufacturing and
system integration processes. Our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends, in part, on our ability
to identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture innovative products and service and bring those offerings to market quickly at cost-
effective prices.
Additionally, due to the specialized nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain a workforce with the
requisite skills in multiple areas including: engineering, science, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, business development and strategy
and management. Our operating performance is also dependent upon personnel who hold security clearances and receive substantial training in order to work
on certain programs or tasks. Additionally, as we expand our operations internationally, it is increasingly important to hire and retain personnel with relevant
experience in local laws, regulations, customs, traditions and business practices.
We face a number of challenges that may affect personnel retention such as our endeavors to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the
affordability of our products and services such as workforce reductions and consolidating and relocating certain operations. Additionally as our workforce
ages, our demographic continues to shift toward a higher proportion of employees nearing retirement. In June 2014, we amended certain of our defined
benefit pension plans for non-union employees to freeze future retirement benefits, which may encourage retirement-eligible personnel to elect to retire earlier
than anticipated. The freeze takes place in two stages and will be completed January 1, 2020.

Table of Contents
To the extent that we lose experienced personnel, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel, and successfully manage
the transfer of critical knowledge. Competition for personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining personnel with the requisite skills
or clearances. We increasingly compete with commercial technology companies outside of the aerospace and defense industry for qualified technical, cyber
and scientific positions as the number of qualified domestic engineers is decreasing and the number of cyber professionals is not keeping up with demand. To
the extent that these companies grow at a faster rate or face fewer cost and product pricing constraints, they may be able to offer more attractive compensation
and other benefits to candidates or our existing employees. To the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher
labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees; we could experience difficulty in performing our contracts if we were unable
to do so. We also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business. While we have processes in place for management
transition and the transfer of knowledge, the loss of key personnel, coupled with an inability to adequately train other personnel, hire new personnel or
transfer knowledge, could significantly impact our ability to perform under our contracts.
Approximately 21% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Historically, where employees are covered
by collective bargaining agreements with various unions, we have been successful in negotiating renewals to expiring agreements without any material
disruption of operating activities. This does not assure, however, that we will be successful in our efforts to negotiate renewals of our existing collective
bargaining agreements in the future. If we encounter difficulties with renegotiations or renewals of collective bargaining arrangements or are unsuccessful in
those efforts, we could incur additional costs and experience work stoppages. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Any delays or work stoppages
could adversely affect our ability to perform under our contracts, which could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
Our estimates and projections may prove to be inaccurate.
The accounting for some of our most significant activities is based on judgments and estimates, which are complex and subject to many variables. For
example, accounting for sales using the percentage-of-completion method requires that we assess risks and make assumptions regarding schedule, cost,
technical and performance issues for each of our thousands of contracts, many of which are long-term in nature. Additionally, we initially allocate the
purchase price of acquired businesses based on a preliminary assessment of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For
significant acquisitions we may use a one-year measurement period to analyze and assess a number of factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair
values as of the acquisition date and could result in adjustments to asset and liability balances. Another example is the $10.8 billion of goodwill assets
recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 from previous acquisitions, which represents approximately 23% of our total assets.
These goodwill assets are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in
circumstances that indicate goodwill may be impaired. If we experience changes or factors arise that negatively affect the expected cash flows of a reporting
unit, we may be required to write off all or a portion of the reporting unit’s related goodwill assets.
Future changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, including those with retroactive effect, and audits by tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in
our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. For example, recent proposals to lower the U.S. corporate income tax rate would require us to reduce
our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time, non-cash increase in income tax expense, but our
income tax expense and payments would be materially reduced in subsequent years. Our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were
$6.6 billion and $6.1 billion, based on a 35% Federal statutory income tax rate, and primarily relate to our postretirement benefit plans. If legislation reducing
the Federal statutory income tax rate to 15% had been enacted at December 31, 2016, our net deferred tax assets would have been reduced by $3.8 billion and
we would have recorded a corresponding one-time, non-cash increase in income tax expense of $3.8 billion. This additional expense would be less if the
legislation phased in the tax rate reduction or if the final rate was higher than 15%. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on
several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations and actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.
Actual financial results could differ from our judgments and estimates. See “Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and use of estimates.

ITEM 2. Properties.
At December 31, 2016, we owned or leased building space (including offices, manufacturing plants, warehouses, service centers, laboratories and other
facilities) at approximately 400 locations primarily in the U.S. Additionally, we manage or occupy various Government-owned facilities under lease and other
arrangements.
At December 31, 2016, we had significant operations in the following locations:
 
• Aeronautics – Palmdale, California; Marietta, Georgia; Greenville, South Carolina; and Fort Worth, Texas.
• Missiles and Fire Control – Camden, Arkansas; Lexington, Kentucky; Ocala and Orlando, Florida; and Grand Prairie, Texas.
• Rotary and Mission Systems – Colorado Springs, Colorado; Stratford, Connecticut; Orlando, Florida; Moorestown/Mt. Laurel, New Jersey; Owego and
Syracuse, New York; Akron, Ohio; Manassas, Virginia; and Mielec, Poland.
• Space Systems – Sunnyvale, California; Denver, Colorado; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Valley Forge, Pennsylvania; and Reading, England.
• Corporate activities – Bethesda, Maryland.
In connection with the increase in ownership interest of AWE Management Limited, we assumed 5.8 million square feet of Government-owned floor
space. As a result of our divestiture of the IS&GS business, we reduced our owned and leased floor space by 3.4 million square feet.
The following is a summary of our square feet of floor space by business segment at December 31, 2016 (in millions):
 
    Owned  Leased  Government-
Owned   Total    
    Aeronautics     5.8    2.4  14.5   22.7    
    Missiles and Fire Control     6.2    2.9    1.8   10.9    
    Rotary and Mission Systems   11.2    7.6    0.4   19.2    
    Space Systems     8.4    2.4  13.6   24.4

Total   34.3  16.3  30.3   80.9    
We believe our facilities are in good condition and adequate for their current use. We may improve, replace or reduce facilities as considered appropriate
to meet the needs of our operations.
 
ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings.
We are a party to or have property subject to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising
under provisions relating to the protection of the environment, and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned. These
types of matters could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that
the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Corporation as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter
may have a material effect on our net earnings in any particular interim reporting period. We cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with
certainty. These matters include the proceedings summarized in “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials
and remediation of contaminated sites. As a result, we are a party to or have property subject to various lawsuits or proceedings involving environmental
protection matters. Due in part to their complexity and pervasiveness, such requirements have resulted in us being involved with related legal proceedings,
claims and remediation obligations. The extent of our financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated at this time. For information regarding
these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for remediation or clean-up to the extent estimable, see “Critical
Accounting Policies – Environmental Matters” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 14 –
 Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to various audits and investigations by the U.S. Government to determine whether our operations are
being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. U.S.

Table of Contents
Government investigations of us, whether relating to government contracts or conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil, or criminal
liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us, suspension, proposed debarment, debarment from eligibility for future U.S.
Government contracting, or suspension of export privileges. Suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our dependence
on contracts with the U.S. Government. U.S. Government investigations often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. We also
provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S., which are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations and foreign procurement policies
and practices. Our compliance with local regulations or applicable U.S. Government regulations also may be audited or investigated.

 (a) Our operating profit and net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations were affected by severance charges of $80 million
($52 million or $0.17 per share, after tax) in 2016; severance charges of $82 million ($53 million or $0.17 per share, after tax) in 2015; severance charges of
$156 million ($101 million or $0.31 per share, after tax) in 2013. See “Note 15 – Restructuring Char ges” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for a discussion of 2016 and 2015 restructuring char ges.
 (b) The impact of our postretirement benefit plans can cause our operating profit, net earnings, cash flows and certain amounts recorded on our consolidated balance
sheets to fluctuate. Accord ingly , our earnings were affected by a FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $902 million, $400 million and $317 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014
and $(500) million and $(832) million in 2013 and 2012. We made $23 million in 2016 and $5 million in 2015 of pension contributions (for our newly established
Sikorsky plan), $2.0 billion  in 2014, $2.25 billion in 2013 and $3.6 billion in 2012 (for our legacy plans), and these contributions caused fluctuations in our operating
cash flows and cash balance between each of those years. Fluctuations in our total assets, total liabilities and stockholders’ equity between years 2012 to 2014
primarily were due to the annual measurement of the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans. See “Critical Accounting Policies – Postretirement Benefit
Plans” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information.
 (c) Our net earnings from discontinued operations includes a $1.2 billion net gain in 2016 related to the divesture of our IS&GS business.

 (d) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
 (e) Included in total current assets are assets of discontinued operations of $1.0 billion in 2015, $900 milli on in 2014, $1.0 billion in 2013, and $1.1 billion in 2012.
Included in total current liabilities are liabilities of discontinued operations of $900 million in each of the years 2015, 2014 and 2013 and $1.0 billion in 2012. Included
in total assets are assets of discontinued operations of $4.1 billion in 2015, $4.2 billion in 2014, $3.9 billion in 2013, and $4.0 billion in 2012. Included in total
liabilities are liabilities of discontinued operations of $1.2 billion in 2015, $1.2 billion in 2014, $1.2 billion in 2013, and $1.3 billion in 2012.
 (f) The increase in our goodw ill and total assets from 2014 to 2015 was primarily attributable to the Sikorsky acquisition, which resulted in an increase in goodwill and
total assets as of December 31, 2015 of $2.8 billion and $1 1.7 billion, respectively .
 (g) The increase in our total debt and total liabilities from 2014 to 2015 was primarily a result of the debt incurred to fund the Sikorsky acquisition, as well as the issuance
of debt in February of 2015 for general corporate purposes (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).
 (h) The fluctuatio ns in our net cash provided by operating activities between years 2012 to 2016 were due to changes in pension contributions, working capital and tax
payments made. See “Liquidity and Cash Flows” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information.
 (i) The increase in our cash used for investing activities in 2015 was attributable to acquisitions of businesses , including the $9.0 billion acquisition of Sikorsky in 2015,
net of cash acquired (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
 (j) The increase in our cash provided by financing activ ities in 2015 was primarily a result of the debt incurred to fund the Sikorsky acquisition (see “Note 10 – Debt”
included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in our cash used for financing activities in 2014 was due to decreased proceeds from stock
option exercis es; higher dividends paid and increased payments for repurchases of common stock. See “Liquidity and Cash Flows” in Management’ s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information.
 (k) Backlog at December 31, 2016 and 2015 includes  approximately $14.7 billion and approximately $15.6 billion related to Sikorsky and excludes backlog at
December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 of $4.8 billion, $6.0 billion, $6.3 billion and $6.7 billion related to our IS&GS business, which we divested in 2016.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Business Overview
We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of
advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system
integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial
applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2016, 71% of our $47.2 billion in net sales were from the U.S.
Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 59% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 27% were from international
customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 2% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our
main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space Systems. We
organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered.
We operate in an environment characterized by both increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally.
A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our
products and services and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our
customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent
markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue
to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to
succeed without limiting our ability to return substantially all of our free cash flow1 to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
We expect 2017 net sales will increase in the mid-single digit range from 2016 levels. The projected growth is driven by increased production and
sustainment volume on the F-35 program at Aeronautics as well as increased volume at MFC and RMS, partially offset by decreased volume at Space
Systems. Operating profit margin is expected to decline from 2016 levels primarily driven by higher volume on the F-35 program, which is dilutive to our
overall profit margin, contract mix at MFC, lower AWE Management Limited (AWE) earnings as a result of the non-cash gain recognized in 2016 related the
consolidation of AWE, amortization of AWE intangible assets in 2017 and lower equity earnings at Space Systems. Accordingly, we expect 2017 segment
operating profit margin will decline from our 2016 margin to just above 10%. Our outlook for 2017 assumes the U.S. Government continues to support and
fund our key programs, consistent with the government fiscal year (GFY) 2017 budget. Changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions,
which could materially change our current estimate of 2017 net sales and operating profit margin. For additional information related to trends in net sales and
operating profit at our business segments, see the “Business Segment Results of Operations” discussion below.
We expect the 2017 FAS/CAS pension adjustment to be approximately $880 million, which incorporates a year end 2016 discount rate of 4.125%, a 25
basis point decrease from the end of 2015; an actual investment return during 2016 of approximately 5.0%; a 50 basis point reduction in our long-term rate of
return assumption from 8.00% to 7.50%; and the revised longevity assumptions released on October 20, 2016 by the Society of Actuaries. We do not expect
to make contributions to our legacy qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2017.
Portfolio Shaping Activities
We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in
part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.
We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and
allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could
perform better outside of our organization. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements
regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, ventures and equity investments.
 
1 We define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less capital expenditures as presented on our
consolidated statements of cash flows.

Business Developments
Acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation
On November 6, 2015, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 19, 2015 by and between us and United Technologies Corporation
(UTC) and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of UTC, we completed the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) for $9.0 billion, net of cash
acquired. Sikorsky, a global company primarily engaged in the design, manufacture, service and support of military and commercial helicopters, has become
a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, aligned under the RMS business segment. We funded the acquisition with new debt issuances, commercial paper and cash
on hand. We and UTC made a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code, which treats the transaction as an asset purchase for tax
purposes. Calculated using the Federal Statutory income tax rate, this election generates a cash tax benefit with an estimated net present value at the date of
acquisition of $1.9 billion for us and our stockholders. The 2015 financial results of the acquired Sikorsky business have been included in our consolidated
results of operations from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the consolidated financial results for the year
ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of Sikorsky’s operations. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within “Liquidity and
Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the debt we incurred in
connection with the Sikorsky acquisition.
Divestiture of the Information Systems & Global Solutions Business
On August 16, 2016, we completed the previously announced divestiture of the IS&GS business, which merged with a subsidiary of Leidos, in a Reverse
Morris Trust transaction (the “Transaction”). The Transaction was completed in a multi-step process pursuant to which we initially contributed the IS&GS
business to Abacus Innovations Corporation (Abacus), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin created to facilitate the Transaction, and the common
stock of Abacus was distributed to participating Lockheed Martin stockholders through an exchange offer. Under the terms of the exchange offer, Lockheed
Martin stockholders had the option to exchange shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of Abacus common stock. At the conclusion of the
exchange offer, all shares of Abacus common stock were exchanged for 9,369,694 shares of Lockheed Martin common stock held by Lockheed Martin
stockholders that elected to participate in the exchange. The shares of Lockheed Martin common stock that were exchanged and accepted were retired,
reducing the number of shares of our common stock outstanding by approximately 3%. Following the exchange offer, Abacus merged with a subsidiary of
Leidos, with Abacus continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leidos. As part of the merger, each share of Abacus common
stock was automatically converted into one share of Leidos common stock. We did not receive any shares of Leidos common stock as part of the Transaction
and do not hold any shares of Leidos or Abacus common stock following the Transaction. Based on an opinion of outside tax counsel, subject to customary
qualifications and based on factual representations, both the exchange offer and merger will qualify as tax-free transactions to Lockheed Martin and its
stockholders, except to the extent that cash was paid to Lockheed Martin stockholders in lieu of fractional shares.
In connection with the Transaction, Abacus borrowed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.84 billion under term loan facilities with third
party financial institutions, the proceeds of which were used to make a one-time special cash payment of $1.80 billion to Lockheed Martin and to pay
associated borrowing fees and expenses. The entire special cash payment was used to repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock in the third and fourth
quarters of 2016. The obligations under the Abacus term loan facilities were guaranteed by Leidos as part of the Transaction.
As a result of the Transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.2 billion. The net gain represents the $2.5 billion fair value of the shares of
Lockheed Martin common stock exchanged and retired as part of the exchange offer, plus the $1.8 billion one-time special cash payment, less the net book
value of the IS&GS business of about $3.0 billion at August 16, 2016 and other adjustments of about $100 million. The final gain is subject to certain post-
closing adjustments, including final working capital and tax adjustments, which we expect to complete in 2017.
We classified the operating results of the IS&GS business as discontinued operations in our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as the
divestiture of this business represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. However, the cash flows generated by
the IS&GS business have not been reclassified in our consolidated statements of cash flows as we retained this cash as part of the Transaction.
Other
On August 24, 2016, our ownership interest in the AWE venture increased by 18% in exchange for our assuming a more significant role in managing the
operations of the venture. As a result of the increase, we now own a 51% interest in AWE
 
28
Table of Contents
and control its operations and board of directors. Accordingly, we are required to consolidate AWE, which has been aligned under our Space Systems
business segment since August 24, 2016. Space Systems’ operating results include 100% of AWE’s net sales and 51% of AWE’s operating profit. Previously,
we accounted for our investment in AWE using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, none of AWE’s net sales and only 33% of AWE’s
net earnings were included in operating profit of the Space Systems business segment.
Additionally, we paid $898 million during 2014 for acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates, net of cash acquired, primarily related to the
following acquisitions:
 
• Systems Made Simple – a provider of health information technology solutions, which was included in our divesture of the IS&GS business;
• Zeta Associates, Inc. – a designer of systems that enable collection, processing, safeguarding and dissemination of information for intelligence and defense
communities, which is included in our Space Systems business segment; and
• Industrial Defender – a provider of cybersecurity solutions for control systems in the oil and gas, utility and chemical industries, which was included in our
divesture of the IS&GS business.
For additional information, see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Industry Considerations
U.S. Government Funding Constraints
The U.S. Government has not yet passed an annual budget for Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2017. Accordingly, the U.S. Government is currently
operating under a continuing resolution funding measure through April 28, 2017. Under this continuing resolution, partial-year funding at amounts consistent
with appropriated levels for fiscal year 2016 are available, subject to certain restrictions, however, new spending initiatives are not authorized. Our key
programs continue to be supported and funded despite the continuing resolution financing mechanism. However, during periods covered by continuing
resolutions, or until regular annual appropriation bills are passed, we may experience delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding
and those delays may affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
During 2016, President Obama’s Administration and both houses of Congress proposed budget plans for GFY 2017 that were broadly divergent in how
they would be implemented, but set overall national defense spending limits at amounts consistent with the current limit imposed by the Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2015. Significant differences remain in the various proposed budgets’ funding sources and the potential use of overseas continuing operations funds for
additional DoD-based budget. While we cannot predict budget resolution timing, we are hopeful that congressional deliberations can be concluded as soon as
possible. A substantial delay would require an extension of the continuing resolution to enable continuation of government operations beyond April 28, 2017.
While we think it is unlikely, a continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints could be extended for the full 2017 fiscal year should the varying
budget positions remain unresolved. In the event of a full year continuing resolution, we would anticipate some level of impact against our 2017 orders and
associated backlog level, but minimal impact to sales, earnings and cash flows in 2017 as a large portion of our backlog work is already funded from prior
fiscal years, or we could face a government shutdown of unknown duration.
We anticipate there will continue to be a significant amount of debate and negotiations within the U.S. Government over defense spending for GFY 2017
and beyond. In the context of these negotiations, it is possible that existing cuts to government programs could be kept in place, replaced with different
spending cuts, and/or replaced with a package of broader reforms to reduce the federal deficit. However, we continue to believe that our portfolio of products
and services will continue to be well supported in a strategically focused allocation of budget resources.
International Business
A key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our
relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. We conduct business with international customers through each of our business
segments.
In our Aeronautics business segment, there continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S.
Government and eight international partner countries and three international customers,
 
29
Table of Contents
as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the eight partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing,
production and sustainment of the F-35. The international commitment to the program continues to grow. For example, Denmark formally committed in 2016
to 27 F-35A variant aircraft. Japan received its first F-35A variant and two F-35A variant aircraft arrived in Israel. Additionally in 2016, Aeronautics received
an undefinitized contract modification to the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 10 advance acquisition contract, which included 35 international orders.
Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs. Aeronautics received a contract in
2016 with Korea for F-16 upgrades, extending work beyond 2020. The C-130J Super Hercules aircraft continued to draw interest from various international
customers, including contracts in 2016 from France and Israel.
Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which
produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 is an advanced missile
defense system designed to intercept incoming airborne threats. During 2016, we received orders for PAC-3 systems from Qatar, the Republic of Korea, the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). THAAD is an integrated system designed to protect against short- and intermediate-
range ballistic missiles. UAE is an international customer for THAAD, and other countries in the Middle East, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have also
expressed interest in our air and missile defense systems. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control
products. In 2016, Poland became the first international customer for the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), a long range,
conventional air-to-ground, precision-guided standoff missile. Other MFC international customers include Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan and
Kuwait.
In our RMS business segment, we continue to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. We perform activities in
the development, production, ship integration and test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Korea and Australia. We
have an ongoing program in Canada for combat systems equipment upgrades on 12 Halifax-class frigates. In 2016, we were designated as the combat systems
integrator for Australia’s Future Submarine program. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United
Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Singapore and Australia. Our acquisition of Sikorsky adds a significant international component to the RMS business
segment with an installed base of over 1,000 aircraft internationally. We have active development, production and sustainment support of the S-70i Black
Hawk and MH-60 Seahawk aircraft to foreign military customers, including Chile, Australia, Denmark, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and Colombia. Commercial
aircraft are sold to customers in the oil and gas industry, emergency medical evacuation, search and rescue fleets in over 30 countries, and VIP customers.
Our Space Systems business segment includes the operations of AWE, which operates the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program. The work at
AWE covers the entire life cycle, from initial concept, assessment and design, through component manufacture and assembly, in-service support and
decommissioning and disposal. In addition, Space Systems has international contracts with Saudi Arabia and Japan to design and manufacture geostationary
communication satellites using the A2100 satellite platform.
Status of the F-35 Program
The F-35 program consists of development contracts, production contracts and sustainment activities. The development contracts are being performed
concurrent with the production contracts. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts is used for complex programs to test aircraft,
shorten the time to field systems, and achieve overall cost savings. We expect the System Development and Demonstration portion of the development
contracts will be substantially complete in 2017, with less significant efforts continuing into 2019. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many
years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,443 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments
from our eight international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries.
On November 2, 2016, the U.S. Government unilaterally issued a contract (referred to as LRIP 9) to purchase 57 F-35 aircraft, including 42 F-35A
conventional takeoff and landing variant (F-35A) aircraft at a production price that is 5.5% less than the production price for the F-35A variant in its previous
contract to acquire F-35 aircraft (referred to as LRIP 8). The unilateral contract action obligates us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S.
Government. At the time of the U.S. Government’s decision to issue the unilateral contract, the parties had reached agreement in principle on
 
30
Table of Contents
certain terms and conditions of the contract. However, certain key terms remained under negotiation, including the amount of cost to perform the contract,
price and payment terms. We will continue to execute on the F-35 program and are evaluating our options and path forward. Although the amount at issue on
the LRIP 9 contract is not a significant percentage of the overall contract value, the unilateral contract action could negatively affect profit and cash flows on
the LRIP 9 and LRIP 10 (which remains undefinitized) contracts, and establish a precedent for future F-35 production contracts.
There is also uncertainty regarding actions that may be taken by the new Presidential Administration in light of recent criticisms of the F-35 program.
President Trump has publicly expressed concerns over past cost overruns and delays in the program as well as overall program cost and has publicly
requested that a competitor price out an alternative. Defense Secretary Mattis recently ordered a review of the program, including a comparison review of the
F-35C carrier variant with a fourth generation alternative. Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer has had discussions with President Trump on
the importance of the F-35 program and our commitment to cut costs. However, we may continue to face pressure to reduce costs from the new Presidential
Administration relating to the F-35 program and ongoing contract negotiations.
Operationally, the U.S. Government continues to complete various tests, including ship trials, mission system evaluations and weapons testing, and the
F-35 aircraft fleet recently surpassed 80,000 flight hours. Progress also continues on the production of aircraft. In 2016, the program achieved a major
milestone when the U.S. Air Force declared the F-35A variant ready for combat (also referred to as Initial Operating Capability (IOC)). The program
continues to advance towards the U.S. Navy declaring the F-35C carrier variant ready for combat in 2018, as demonstrated by completing final carrier tests
aboard the USS George Washington in 2016. Additionally, in 2016 we had initial deliveries of F-35 aircraft to Israel and Japan. As of December 31, 2016, we
have delivered 200 production aircraft to our U.S. and international partners including delivery of the first F-35 aircraft completed at the Italian Final
Assembly and Check-Out Facility, and we have 173 production aircraft in backlog, including orders from our international partners.
During aircraft inspections in 2016, debris was found in the fuel tank of an F-35A variant aircraft. It was determined the debris was caused by insulation
shedding from tubing that is part of the system that provides cooling for the electronics and avionics and is located within the wing. Engineering assessments
determined the tube assembly was wrapped using non-compliant insulation material. The non-compliant insulation was confined to only the F-35A variant
aircraft. This issue affected 15 delivered aircraft and 42 aircraft in the factory. During the fourth quarter of 2016, modification work was completed to correct
the issue on the 15 operational aircraft and flight operations have resumed. The issue was also corrected on many of the aircraft in the factory prior to
delivery. The remaining affected aircraft will be corrected and delivered in 2017. This issue did not have a significant impact on our operating results or cash
flows.
Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule,
cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include,
but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance, software development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and
warranties, receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests, findings resulting from testing, and operating the
aircraft.
Consolidated Results of Operations
Since our operating cycle is primarily long term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and
related activities with varying delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be
indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts
cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted.

(a)For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating profit includes $45 million of operating loss at Sikorsky , which is less than 1% of consolidated operating profit in 2015.
Sikorsky’ s operating loss is net of intangible amortization and adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Certain amounts reported in other income, net, primarily our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating
profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in our discussion of our business segment results of operations.
Net Sales
We generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Product sales are predominantly generated in each of our business
segments and most of our service sales are generated in our RMS and Aeronautics business segments. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in
millions):
 
   2016  2015  2014       
Products  $   40,365   $   34,868   $   34,984        
% of total net sales   85.4%   86.0%   87.6%     
Services   6,883    5,668    4,962        
% of total net sales   14.6%   14.0%   12.4%     
Total net sales  $   47,248   $   40,536   $   39,946        
Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we record
net sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion.
The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our
consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change
in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion method.
Product Sales
Product sales increased $5.5 billion, or 16%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $3.7 billion at
RMS and approximately $1.8 billion at Aeronautics. The increase in product sales at RMS was primarily attributable to sales from Sikorsky, which was
acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase was partially offset by lower net sales for training and logistics programs due to the divestiture of our
Lockheed Martin Commercial Flight Training (LMCFT) business, which reported sales through the May 2, 2016 divestiture date. The increase at Aeronautics
was primarily attributable to the F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and the C-130 program due to increased aircraft deliveries.
 
32
Table of Contents
Product sales decreased $116 million, or less than 1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. Lower product sales of about $290 million at Space Systems and
approximately $250 million at MFC were partially offset by higher product sales of about $300 million at RMS and approximately $120 million at
Aeronautics. The decrease in product sales at Space Systems was attributable to lower volume for government satellite programs (primarily Advanced
Extremely High Frequency (AEHF). Product sales at MFC decreased due to lower volume on air and missile defense systems programs (primarily PAC-3).
The increase in product sales at RMS was primarily attributable to product sales from Sikorsky, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. Product
sales at Aeronautics increased primarily due to higher volume on F-35 production contracts, as well as increased deliveries on our C-5 program; partially
offset by fewer aircraft deliveries for our C-130 and F-16 programs and lower sustainment activities on our F-22 program.
Service Sales
Service sales increased $1.2 billion, or 21%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $700 million at RMS
and approximately $360 million at Aeronautics. The increase in service sales at RMS was primarily attributable to sales from Sikorsky, which was acquired in
the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in service sales at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to increased sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and
F-16 programs).
Service sales increased $706 million, or 14%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in service sales was primarily attributable to higher service
sales of approximately $530 million at Aeronautics and about $190 million at Space Systems. Higher service sales at Aeronautics were primarily due to
increased sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 program). The increase in service sales at Space Systems was primarily due to service sales of entities
acquired in the third quarter of 2014.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and
administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain
contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for
estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions):
 
   2016  2015  2014        
Cost of sales – products  $(36,616)  $(31,091)  $(30,983)        
% of product sales   90.7%   89.2%   88.6%      
Cost of sales – services   (6,040)   (4,824)   (4,184)        
% of service sales   87.8%   85.1%   84.3%      
Severance charges   (80)   (82)   —         
Other unallocated, net   550    (47)   (96)        
Total cost of sales  $(42,186)  $(36,044)  $(35,263)        
Due to the nature of percentage-of-completion accounting, changes in our cost of sales for both products and services are typically accompanied by
changes in our net sales. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem
with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. We have not identified any developing
trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations.
Product Costs
Product costs increased approximately $5.5 billion, or 18%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased product costs of
about $3.6 billion at RMS and about $1.6 billion at Aeronautics. The increase at RMS was primarily attributable to product costs generated by Sikorsky,
which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to increased volume on aircraft production for the
F-35 program and increased aircraft deliveries on the C-130 program.
Product costs increased approximately $108 million, or less than 1%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. Increased product costs of approximately
$445 million at RMS and about $180 million at Aeronautics, were offset by decreases in product costs of approximately $325 million at Space Systems and
$195 million at MFC. Increases in product costs at RMS were due primarily to the Sikorsky acquisition, including costs of Sikorsky products, intangible
amortization and adjustments required
 
33
Table of Contents
to account for the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015. Higher product costs at Aeronautics were attributable to the reasons stated above for higher
product sales, as well as decreased risk retirements (primarily F-22). The changes in product costs at Space Systems and MFC were attributable to the reasons
stated above for higher product sales.
Service Costs
Service costs increased approximately $1.2 billion, or 25%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased service costs of about $670 million at
RMS and approximately $400 million at Aeronautics. The increase at RMS was primarily attributable to service costs generated by Sikorsky, which was
acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to increased sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and
the F-22 programs).
Service costs increased approximately $640 million, or 15%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Higher service costs of approximately $450 million at
Aeronautics and about $230 million at Space Systems were due to the reasons stated above for higher service sales. These increases in service costs were
partially offset by a decrease in service costs of about $80 million at MFC due primarily to lower service costs on various air and missile defense programs.
Restructuring Charges
2016 Actions
During 2016, we recorded severance charges totaling approximately $80 million related to our Aeronautics business segment. The charges consisted of
severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated
employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several
quarters. During 2016, we paid $70 million in severance payments associated with these actions.
2015 Actions
During 2015, we recorded severance charges totaling $82 million, of which $67 million related to our RMS business segment and $15 million related to
businesses that were reported in our former IS&GS business prior to our fourth quarter 2015 program realignment. The charges consisted of severance costs
associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated employees receive
lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several quarters. During 2016,
we paid $64 million in severance payments associated with these actions.
In connection with the Sikorsky acquisition, we assumed obligations related to certain restructuring actions committed to by Sikorsky in June 2015. Net
of amounts we anticipate to recover through the pricing of our products and services to our customers, we incurred and paid $40 million of costs in 2016
related to these actions.
We expect to recover a substantial amount of the restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other
customers in future periods, with the impact included in the respective business segment’s results of operations.
Other Unallocated, Net
Other unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment as described in the Business Segment Results of Operations section below,
stock-based compensation and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the cost of sales
for products and services. Other unallocated, net was $550 million of income in 2016, compared to expense of $47 million in 2015 and $96 million in 2014.
The fluctuation between each respective period was primarily attributable to the change in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $902 million in 2016,
$400 million in 2015 and $317 million in 2014, partially offset by fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were
individually significant. The changes in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment between the periods was primarily attributable to the increase in U.S. Government
Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) pension cost due to the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization. See “Critical Accounting Policies –Postretirement
Benefit Plans” discussion below for more information on our CAS pension cost.
As a result of the divestiture of the IS&GS business, we retained all assets and obligations related to pension benefits earned by current and former
IS&GS business salaried employees through the closing of the Transaction. Pension costs were
 
34
Table of Contents
historically allocated to and included in the results of operations of the IS&GS business. In connection with the reclassification of the IS&GS business as
discontinued operations, we reclassified the non-service portion of net pension costs related to IS&GS business salaried employee benefits (interest cost,
actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets) from cost of sales (and previously reported in the IS&GS business’ operating profit) to other
unallocated, net on our consolidated statements of earnings as corporate expenses because these costs will continue to be incurred by us subsequent to the
Transaction. The service portion of net pension costs related to IS&GS business salaried employees that transferred to Leidos continued to be included in the
operating results of the IS&GS business classified as discontinued operations because such costs will no longer be incurred by us subsequent to the
Transaction. These net pension costs were $54 million, $71 million and $59 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
In connection with the divestiture of the IS&GS business and reclassification of the IS&GS business to discontinued operations for all periods presented
in the consolidated financial statements, certain corporate overhead costs incurred by us and previously allocated to the IS&GS business were reclassified
from the IS&GS business results (which is recorded in net earnings from discontinued operations) to other unallocated, net in our consolidated statements of
earnings. These overhead costs related to expenses for senior management, legal, human resources, finance, accounting, treasury, tax, information technology,
communications, ethics and compliance, corporate employee benefits, incentives and stock-based compensation, shared services processing and
administration and depreciation for corporate fixed assets, and were not directly attributable to the IS&GS business. During the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014 we reclassified $82 million, $165 million and $169 million of corporate overhead costs to other unallocated, net.
We allocate certain corporate overhead costs and defined benefit pension costs to our business segments because under U.S. Government contracting
regulations such costs are allowable in establishing prices for contracts with the U.S. Government. Although the corporate overhead costs and defined benefit
pension costs that were historically allocated to and included in the operating results of the IS&GS business have been reclassified to and included in the
results of our continuing operations for financial reporting purposes, we will allocate similar costs incurred in future periods to our remaining business
segments and expect to recover a substantial amount of these costs through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other
customers in future periods.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net primarily includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees and gains or losses for acquisitions and divestitures.
Other income, net in 2016 was $487 million, compared to $220 million in 2015 and $329 million in 2014. The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, was
primarily attributable to the non-cash net gain of $104 million associated with obtaining a controlling interest in AWE and approximately $120 million of
increased earnings generated by equity method investees as discussed in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below. Additionally, in 2015
we incurred a $90 million non-cash impairment charge related to our decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT business.
The decrease in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily due to a $90 million non-cash impairment charge related to our decision in 2015 to divest our
LMCFT business and non-recoverable transaction costs of approximately $38 million associated with the Sikorsky acquisition, partially offset by fluctuations
in other various costs, none of which were individually significant. The asset impairment charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit related to
LMCFT of about $80 million, which is recorded in income tax expense. Earnings from equity method investees in 2015 were comparable to 2014 (reflecting
decreased earnings from equity method investees in our Space Systems business segment, offset by increased earnings from Sikorsky equity method
investees).
Interest Expense
Interest expense in 2016 was $663 million, compared to $443 million in 2015 and $340 million in 2014. The increases in interest expense in 2016 and
2015 relate to debt we incurred to fund the acquisition of Sikorsky, and the issuance of notes in February of 2015 for general corporate purposes. See “Capital
Structure, Resources and Other” included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt.
Other Non-Operating Income, Net
Other non-operating income, net decreased $30 million from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to a gain from the sale of an investment in 2015 which did not
recur in 2016. Other non-operating income, net increased $25 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a gain from the sale of an investment in 2015.

Table of Contents
Income Tax Expense
Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 23.2% for 2016, 27.3% for 2015, and 30.4% for 2014. The rates for all periods benefited
from tax deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities, deductions for dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan
feature, and the U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credit. The U.S. manufacturing deduction benefit for 2016, 2015, and 2014 reduced our effective
tax rate by 2.4, 2.9, and 2.6 percentage points, respectively. The rate for 2016 also benefited from the nontaxable gain recorded in connection with the
consolidation of AWE.
In addition, the rate for 2016 benefited from the additional tax benefits related to employee share-based payment awards, which are now recorded in
earnings as income tax benefit or expense, effective with the adoption of an accounting standard update during the second quarter of 2016. As a result, we are
required to report the impacts as though the accounting standard update had been adopted on January 1, 2016. Accordingly, we recognized additional income
tax benefits of $152 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 3.1 percentage points. The adjustment
for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes second, third, and fourth quarter impacts and the reclassification of income tax benefits of $104 million
originally recognized in additional paid-in capital in the first quarter of 2016.
In 2016, the R&D tax credit reduced our effective tax rate by 2.2 percentage points. In December 2015, the R&D tax credit was permanently extended
and reinstated, retroactive to the beginning of 2015, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 1.6 percentage points. In 2014, the R&D tax credit was
temporarily reinstated for one year, retroactive to the beginning of 2014, which reduced our effective tax rate by 0.9 percentage point.
As a result of a decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT business in 2016, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $90 million. This
charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about $80 million. The net impact of the resulting tax benefit reduced our effective income tax rate
by 1.2 percentage points in 2015.
Future changes in tax law could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and our deferred tax asset and liability
balances. Recent proposals to lower the U.S. corporate income tax rate would require us to reduce our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of new tax
legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time, non-cash increase in income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would be materially
reduced in subsequent years. Our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $6.6 billion and $6.1 billion, based on a 35% the Federal
statutory income tax rate, and primarily relate to our postretirement benefit plans. If legislation reducing the Federal statutory income tax rate to 15% had
been enacted at December 31, 2016, our net deferred tax assets would have been reduced by $3.8 billion and we would have recorded a corresponding
one-time, non-cash increase in income tax expense of $3.8 billion. This additional expense would be less if the legislation phased in the tax rate reduction or
if the final rate was higher than 15%. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of
our postretirement benefit plan obligations and actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.
Net Earnings from Continuing Operations
We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $3.8 billion ($12.38 per share) in 2016, $3.1 billion ($9.93 per share) in 2015 and $3.3 billion
($10.09 per share) in 2014. Both net earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per
share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 14 million common shares outstanding from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 and
approximately 11 million common shares outstanding from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 as a result of share repurchases and the completion of
the exchange offer, which were partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.
Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations
We reported net earnings from discontinued operations of $1.5 billion ($5.11 per share) in 2016, $479 million ($1.53 per share) in 2015 and $361 million
($1.12 per share) in 2014. Net earnings from discontinued operations in 2016 included a net gain of approximately $1.2 billion recognized as a result of the
divestiture of the IS&GS business.
Net Earnings
We reported net earnings of $5.3 billion ($17.49 per share) in 2016, $3.6 billion ($11.46 per share) in 2015 and $3.6 billion ($11.21 per share) in 2014.

Table of Contents
Business Segment Results of Operations
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products
and services offered. Net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. The amounts,
discussion and presentation of our business segments as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include the results of the acquired Sikorsky business
from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date.
Operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees because the operating activities of the
equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. United Launch Alliance (ULA), which is part of our Space Systems
business segment, is one of our largest equity method investees. Operating profit of our business segments excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment
described below; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating
performance, such as charges related to goodwill impairments (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements) and significant severance actions (see “Note 15 – Restructuring Charges” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements);
gains or losses from divestitures (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); the effects of
certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. These items are included in the
reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit.
Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which we
refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, the
CAS pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Since our consolidated financial statements must present
pension expense calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which we refer to as FAS
pension expense, the FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or decreases the CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations to
equal the FAS pension expense. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds FAS pension expense, which occurred for 2016, 2015 and 2014, we
have a favorable FAS/CAS pension adjustment.
The operating results in the following tables exclude businesses included in discontinued operations (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures”
included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) for all years presented.

(a)FAS pension expense, CAS  pension costs and severance charges reflect the reclassification for discontinu ed operations presentation of benefits related to former IS&GS
salaried employees (see “Note 1 1 – Postretirement Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
(b)The higher CAS pension cost primarily reflects the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization.
(c)We expect a F AS/CAS pension adjustment in 2017 of about $880 million (see “Critical Accounting Policies – Postretirement Benefit Plans” discussion below).
(d)See “Consolidated Results of Operations – Restructuring Char ges” discussion above for information on charges related to certain severance actions at our business
segments. Severance char ges for initiatives that are not significant are included in business segment operating profit.
(e)Other , net in 2015 includes a non-cash  asset impairment charge of approximately $90 million related to our decision to divest our LMCFT business (see “Note 3 –
Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Note s to Consolidated Financial Statements). This charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about
$80 million, which is recorded in income tax expense. The net impact reduced net earnings by about $10 million.
(f)Other , net in 2015 includes approximately $38 million of non-recoverable  transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Sikorsky .
The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $96.2 billion,
$94.8 billion and $74.5 billion at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Backlog at December 31, 2015 and 2014 excludes approximately $4.8 billion and
$6.0 billion of backlog related to our IS&GS business, which we divested in 2016. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which
funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated).
Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was
approximately $66.0 billion at December 31, 2016.
Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense.
Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the
business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales
and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.
We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner
specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for
 
38
Table of Contents
a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work
being performed (such as help-desk support). Our contracts generally are cost-based, which allows for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and
services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs
to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs.
We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to
ensure their availability at known unit prices.
Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to
the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the
contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g.,
the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation
agreements required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the
ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase
during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the
estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase.
All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate.
We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of
these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our
other programs.
Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted
through the U.S. Government. We account for these contracts, as well as product contracts with non-U.S. Government customers, using the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which represent substantially all of our net sales. We derive our remaining net sales from contracts to
provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under the services method of accounting.
Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular
contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs plus a fee.
For fixed-priced contracts, net sales and cost of sales are recognized as products are delivered or as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting, changes in our cost of sales are typically accompanied by a related change in our net sales.
Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or
operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating
profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract.
In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit
booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically
referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely,
conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate.
Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating
profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters,
cost recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of
contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions as mentioned above which are excluded from segment operating results;
reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of assets. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit
booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes.
We have a contract to provide an integrated air and missile defense command, control, communications, computers –Integrated Surveillance &
Reconnaissance (C4ISR) system to an international customer. In the first quarter of 2015, we revised our estimated costs to complete the program as a
consequence of performance issues and recorded a reserve of
 
39
Table of Contents
$70 million. Since that time, we have continued to experience issues related to customer requirements and the implementation of this contract and have
periodically accrued additional reserves. Consequently, we are continuing to monitor the scope, estimated costs, and viability of the program and the
possibility of additional customer funding. It is possible that we may have to record additional loss reserves in future periods, which could be material to our
operating results. However, we cannot make an estimate of the total expected costs at this time due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process.
Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, net of state income taxes,
increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion for 2016, 2015 and 2014. The decrease in our consolidated net
adjustments in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in profit booking rate adjustments at our MFC and Space Systems business segments,
partially offset by an increase at our RMS business segment. The increase in our consolidated net adjustments in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to
an increase in profit booking rate adjustments at our Space Systems and Aeronautics business segments, offset by a decrease in profit booking rate
adjustments at our RMS and MFC business segments. The consolidated net adjustments for 2016 are inclusive of approximately $530 million in unfavorable
items, which include reserves for performance matters on an international program at RMS. The consolidated net adjustments for 2015 are inclusive of
approximately $550 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on an international program at RMS and on commercial
satellite programs at Space Systems. The consolidated net adjustments for 2014 are inclusive of approximately $535 million in unfavorable items, which
include reserves recorded on certain training and logistics solutions programs at RMS and net warranty reserve adjustments for various programs (including
JASSM and GMLRS) at MFC as described in the respective business segment’s results of operations below.
Aeronautics
Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of
advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include
the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon, C-5M Super Galaxy and F-22 Raptor. Aeronautics’ operating results
included the following (in millions):
 
   2016  2015  2014        
Net sales  $17,769   $15,570   $14,920         
Operating profit   1,887    1,681    1,649         
Operating margin   10.6%   10.8%   11.1%      
Backlog at year-end  $34,200   $31,800   $27,600         
2016 compared to 2015
Aeronautics’ net sales in 2016 increased $2.2 billion, or 14%, compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately
$1.7 billion for the F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities, partially offset by lower volume on development
activities; and approximately $290 million for the C-130 program due to increased deliveries (24 aircraft delivered in 2016 compared to 21 in 2015) and
increased sustainment activities; and approximately $250 million for the F-16 program primarily due to higher volume on aircraft modernization programs.
The increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $55 million for the C-5 program due to decreased sustainment activities.
Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2016 increased $206 million, or 12%, compared to 2015. Operating profit increased approximately $195 million for the
F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities and higher risk retirements; and by approximately $60 million for
aircraft support and maintenance programs due to higher risk retirements and increased volume. These increases were partially offset by lower operating
profit of approximately $65 million for the C-130 program due to contract mix and lower risk retirements. Adjustments not related to volume, including net
profit booking rate adjustments, were approximately $20 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015.
2015 compared to 2014
Aeronautics’ net sales in 2015 increased $650 million, or 4%, compared to 2014. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately
$1.4 billion for F-35 production contracts due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities; and approximately $150 million for the
C-5 program due to increased deliveries (nine aircraft
 
40
Table of Contents
delivered in 2015 compared to seven delivered in 2014). The increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $350 million for the C-130
program due to fewer aircraft deliveries (21 aircraft delivered in 2015, compared to 24 delivered in 2014), lower sustainment activities and aircraft contract
mix; approximately $200 million due to decreased volume and lower risk retirements on various programs; approximately $195 million for the F-16 program
due to fewer deliveries (11 aircraft delivered in 2015, compared to 17 delivered in 2014); and approximately $190 million for the F-22 program as a result of
decreased sustainment activities.
Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2015 increased $32 million, or 2%, compared to 2014. Operating profit increased by approximately $240 million for
F-35 production contracts due to increased volume and risk retirements; and approximately $40 million for the C-5 program due to increased risk retirements.
These increases were offset by lower operating profit of approximately $90 million for the F-22 program due to lower risk retirements; approximately
$70 million for the C-130 program as a result of the reasons stated above for lower net sales; and approximately $80 million due to decreased volume and risk
retirements on various programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately
$100 million higher in 2015 compared to 2014.
Backlog
Backlog increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher orders on F-35 production and sustainment programs. Backlog increased in 2015
compared to 2014 primarily due to higher orders on F-35 and C-130 programs.
Trends
We expect Aeronautics’ 2017 net sales to increase in the low-double digit percentage range as compared to 2016 due to increased volume on the F-35
program. Operating profit is expected to increase at a slightly lower percentage range, driven by the increased volume on the F-35 program, partially offset by
contract mix that results in a slight decrease in operating margins between years.
Missiles and Fire Control
Our MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire
control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy
management solutions. MFC’s major programs include PAC-3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System, Hellfire, JASSM, Javelin, Apache, Sniper®, Low
Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN®) and Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services (SOF CLSS). In
2016 we submitted a bid for the Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) contract, which is a competitive follow-on
contract to SOF CLSS. We anticipate an award decision on the follow-on contract in mid-2017. MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions):
 
   2016  2015  2014        
Net sales  $6,608   $6,770   $7,092         
Operating profit   1,018    1,282    1,344         
Operating margin   15.4%   18.9%   19.0%      
Backlog at year-end  $14,700   $15,500   $13,300         
2016 compared to 2015
MFC’s net sales in 2016 decreased $162 million, or 2%, compared to 2015. The decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately
$205 million for air and missile defense programs due to decreased volume (primarily THAAD); and lower net sales of approximately $95 million due to
lower volume on various programs. These decreases were partially offset by a $75 million increase for tactical missiles programs due to increased deliveries
(primarily Hellfire); and approximately $70 million for fire control programs due to increased volume (SOF CLSS).
MFC’s operating profit in 2016 decreased $264 million, or 21%, compared to 2015. Operating profit decreased approximately $145 million for air and
missile defense programs due to lower risk retirements (PAC-3 and THAAD) and a reserve for a contractual matter; approximately $45 million for tactical
missiles programs due to lower risk retirements (Javelin); and approximately $45 million for fire control programs due to lower risk retirements (Apache) and
program mix. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and reserves, were about $225 million lower in 2016
compared to 2015.
 
41
Table of Contents
2015 compared to 2014
MFC’s net sales in 2015 decreased $322 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was attributable to lower net sales of
approximately $345 million for air and missile defense programs due to fewer deliveries (primarily PAC-3) and lower volume (primarily THAAD); and
approximately $85 million for tactical missile programs due to fewer deliveries (primarily Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS)) and Joint
Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, partially offset by increased deliveries for Hellfire. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately
$55 million for energy solutions programs due to increased volume.
MFC’s operating profit in 2015 decreased $62 million, or 5%, compared to 2014. The decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of
approximately $100 million for fire control programs due primarily to lower risk retirements (primarily LANTIRN and SNIPER); and approximately
$65 million for tactical missile programs due to lower risk retirements (primarily Hellfire and GMLRS) and fewer deliveries. These decreases were partially
offset by higher operating profit of approximately $75 million for air and missile defense programs due to increased risk retirements (primarily THAAD).
Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $60 million lower in 2015 compared
to 2014.
Backlog
Backlog decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower orders on PAC-3, Hellfire, and JASSM. Backlog increased in 2015 compared to
2014 primarily due to higher orders on PAC-3, LANTIRN/Sniper and certain tactical missile programs, partially offset by lower orders on THAAD.
Trends
We expect MFC’s net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2017 as compared to 2016 driven primarily by our air and missile
defense programs. Operating profit is expected to be flat or increase slightly. Accordingly, operating profit margin is expected to decline from 2016 levels as a
result of contract mix and fewer risk retirements in 2017 compared to 2016.
Rotary and Mission Systems
As previously described, on November 6, 2015, we acquired Sikorsky and aligned the Sikorsky business under our RMS business segment. The 2015
results of the acquired Sikorsky business have been included in our financial results from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through December 31, 2015.
As a result, our consolidated operating results and RMS business segment operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of
Sikorsky operations.
Our RMS business segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and civil helicopters, ship and submarine mission
and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; the Littoral
Combat Ship (LCS); simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. In addition, RMS supports the needs of government
customers in cybersecurity and delivers communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions for defense applications.
RMS’ major programs include Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters, Aegis Combat System (Aegis), LCS, Space Fence, Advanced Hawkeye Radar System,
TPQ-53 Radar System, CH-53K development helicopter, and VH-92A helicopter program. RMS’ operating results included the following (in millions):
 
   2016  2015  2014        
Net sales  $13,462   $9,091   $8,732         
Operating profit   906    844    936         
Operating margin   6.7%   9.3%   10.7%      
Backlog at year-end  $28,400   $30,100   $13,300         
2016 compared to 2015
RMS’ net sales in 2016 increased $4.4 billion, or 48%, compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately
$4.6 billion from Sikorsky, which was acquired on November 6, 2015. Net sales for 2015 include Sikorsky’s results subsequent to the acquisition date, net of
certain revenue adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business. This increase was partially offset by lower net sales of approximately
$70 million for training
 
42
Table of Contents
and logistics programs due to the divestiture of our LMCFT business, which reported sales through the May 2, 2016 divestiture date; and approximately
$65 million for ship and aviation systems programs due to decreased volume on various programs.
RMS’ operating profit in 2016 increased $62 million, or 7%, compared to 2015. Operating profit increased approximately $85 million for training and
logistics programs due primarily to the divestiture of our LMCFT business which generated operating losses through its May 2, 2016 divestiture date; about
$60 million for our integrated warfare systems and sensors programs due to investments made in connection with a next generation radar technology program
awarded during 2015; and approximately $55 million for undersea systems programs due primarily to higher reserves for performance matters on an
international program in 2015. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $70 million as a result of a higher operating loss from Sikorsky, inclusive
of the unfavorable impacts of intangible asset amortization and other adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business; about $30 million
for ship and aviation systems programs due primarily to performance on various programs; and about $25 million for other matters. Adjustments not related
to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and reserves, were about $155 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015.
2015 compared to 2014
RMS’ net sales in 2015 increased $359 million, or 4%, compared to 2014. The increase was attributable to net sales of approximately $400 million from
Sikorsky, net of adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business in the fourth quarter of 2015; and approximately $220 million for
integrated warfare systems and sensors programs, primarily due to the ramp-up of recently awarded programs (Space Fence). These increases were partially
offset by lower net sales of approximately $150 million for undersea systems programs due to decreased volume as a result of in-theater force reductions
(primarily Persistent Threat Detection System); and approximately $105 million for ship and aviation systems programs primarily due to decreased volume
(Merlin Capability Sustainment Program).
RMS’ operating profit in 2015 decreased $92 million, or 10%, compared to 2014. Operating profit decreased by approximately $75 million due to
performance matters on an international program; approximately $45 million for Sikorsky due primarily to intangible amortization and adjustments required
to account for the acquisition of this business in the fourth quarter of 2015; and approximately $15 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors
programs, primarily due to investments made in connection with a recently awarded next generation radar technology program, partially offset by higher risk
retirements (including Halifax Class Modernization). These decreases were partially offset by approximately $20 million in increased operating profit for
training and logistics services programs, primarily due to reserves recorded on certain programs in 2014 that were not repeated in 2015. Adjustments not
related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $100 million lower in 2015 compared to 2014.
Backlog
Backlog decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to sales being recognized on several multi-year programs (primarily in Sikorsky) related to
prior year awards. Backlog increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the addition of Sikorsky’s backlog, as well as higher orders on new program
starts (such as Australian Defence Force Pilot Training System).
Trends
We expect RMS’ 2017 net sales to increase in the low-single digit percentage range compared to 2016. Operating profit is expected to increase in the
low-double-digit percentage range due to a reduction in certain purchase accounting adjustments that were attributable to the Sikorsky acquisition, resulting in
higher operating profit margins between years.
Space Systems
Our Space Systems business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and
defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. Space Systems provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and
ground-based global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space Systems is also responsible for
various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space Systems’ major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic
Missile (FBM), Orion, Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS), AEHF, GPS-III, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series (GOES-R), and
The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). Operating profit for our Space Systems business

segment includes AWE and our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. Space
Systems’ operating results included the following (in millions):
 
   2016  2015  2014        
Net sales  $9,409   $9,105   $9,202         
Operating profit   1,289    1,171    1,187         
Operating margin   13.7%   12.9%   12.9%      
Backlog at year-end  $18,900   $17,400   $20,300         
2016 compared to 2015
Space Systems’ net sales in 2016 increased $304 million, or 3%, compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to net sales of approximately
$410 million from AWE following the consolidation of this business in the third quarter of 2016; and approximately $150 million for commercial space
transportation programs due to increased launch-related activities; and approximately $70 million of higher net sales for various programs (primarily Fleet
Ballistic Missiles) due to increased volume. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of approximately $340 million for government
satellite programs due to decreased volume (primarily SBIRS and MUOS) and the wind-down or completion of mission solutions programs.
Space Systems’ operating profit in 2016 increased $118 million, or 10%, compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a non-cash,
pre-tax gain of approximately $127 million related to the consolidation of AWE; and approximately $80 million of increased equity earnings from joint
ventures (primarily ULA). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $105 million for government satellite programs due to lower
risk retirements (primarily SBIRS, MUOS and mission solutions programs) and decreased volume. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit
booking rate adjustments, were approximately $185 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015.
2015 compared to 2014
Space Systems’ net sales in 2015 decreased $97 million, or 1%, compared to 2014. The decrease was attributable to approximately $335 million lower
net sales for government satellite programs due to decreased volume (primarily AEHF) and the wind-down or completion of mission solutions programs; and
approximately $55 million for strategic missile and defense systems due to lower volume. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of
approximately $235 million for businesses acquired in 2014; and approximately $75 million for the Orion program due to increased volume.
Space Systems’ operating profit in 2015 decreased $16 million, or 1%, compared to 2014. Operating profit increased approximately $85 million for
government satellite programs due primarily to increased risk retirements. This increase was offset by lower operating profit of approximately $65 million for
commercial satellite programs due to performance matters on certain programs; and approximately $35 million due to decreased equity earnings in joint
ventures. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, were approximately $105 million higher in 2015
compared to 2014.
Equity earnings
Total equity earnings recognized by Space Systems (primarily ULA) represented approximately $325 million, $245 million and $280 million, or 25%,
21% and 24% of this business segment’s operating profit during 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Backlog
Backlog increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the addition of AWE’s backlog. Backlog decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily
due to lower orders for government satellite programs and the Orion program and higher sales on the Orion program.
Trends
We expect Space Systems’ 2017 net sales to decrease in the mid-single digit percentage range as compared to 2016, driven by program lifecycles on
government satellite programs, partially offset by the recognition of AWE net sales for a full year in 2017 versus a partial year in 2016 following the
consolidation of AWE in the third quarter of 2016. Operating profit
 
44
Table of Contents
is expected to decline in the low- to mid-double digit percentage range, primarily driven by sales volume, the one-time AWE non-cash gain in 2016,
amortization of the AWE intangible assets in 2017, and lower equity earnings in 2017 compared to 2016. As a result operating profit margin is expected to
decline from 2016 levels.
Liquidity and Cash Flows
We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when
they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business, including capital expenditures, independent research and development
and made selective business acquisitions, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, and managing our debt levels,
maturities and interest rates.
We have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, capital expenditures, debt service and
repayments, dividends, share repurchases and postretirement benefit plan contributions. Our strong operating cash flows enabled our Board of Directors to
approve two key cash deployment initiatives in September 2016. First, we increased our fourth quarter dividend rate by 10% to $1.82 per share. Second, the
Board of Directors approved a $2.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future
common share repurchases under our program was $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2016.
During 2016, we received a one-time, tax-free special cash payment of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of the divestiture of the IS&GS business in
the third quarter of 2016. We used the proceeds to repay $500 million of long-term notes at their scheduled maturity and paid $484 million in dividends with a
portion of this cash. The remainder was used for share repurchases.
We have accessed the capital markets opportunistically as we did in February 2015 when we issued $2.25 billion of long-term debt and as needed as we
did in November 2015 when we issued $7.0 billion of long-term debt in connection with our acquisition of Sikorsky. We also used a combination of short-
term debt financing, commercial paper and available cash to fund the Sikorsky acquisition, as discussed below in “Capital Structure, Resources and Other”
and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to
support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. However, we expect to continue to issue commercial paper backed by
our revolving credit facility to manage the timing of our cash flows. As described in the “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” section below, we have
financing resources available to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary, should they occur. We also have access to credit
markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, our revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial
paper, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular
contracts.
Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source
of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund customer programs
ourselves pending government appropriations and are doing so with increased frequency. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we
may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs.
Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash
more frequently under cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts, which together represent approximately half of the sales we recorded in 2016, as
we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments,
which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are
encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance,
thereby affecting our cash flows.
The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts,
rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a
percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. While the total amount of cash collected on a contract is the same,
performance-based payments have had a more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flows. In addition, our cash flows may be affected if the U.S.
Government decides to withhold payments on our billings. While the impact of withholding payments delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of
cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary.

Table of Contents
The majority of our capital expenditures for 2016 and those planned for 2017 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology.
Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For
example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support higher production of the F-35 combat
aircraft, and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support
programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.
The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions):
 
   2016  2015  2014        
Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year  $1,090   $1,446   $2,617

Cash and cash equivalents at end of year  $1,837   $1,090   $1,446         
Operating Activities
2016 compared to 2015
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $88 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a reduction in cash paid for income taxes,
partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest expense and an increase in cash used for working capital. The $196 million increase in cash flows used
for working capital (defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) was
attributable to timing of cash receipts for receivables (primarily F-35 program), partially offset by timing of production and billing cycles affecting customer
advances and progress payments applied to inventories (primarily C-130 program). See “Critical Accounting Policies –Postretirement Benefit Plans” (under
the caption “Funding Considerations”) for discussion of future postretirement benefit plan funding. We made net income tax payments of $1.3 billion and
$1.8 billion during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We made interest payments of approximately $600 million and approximately
$375 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
We may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract,
we are at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs. In 2014 and 2015, we received customer authorization and initial funding to begin producing F-35
aircraft to be acquired under LRIP 9 and 10 contracts, respectively. As a result of recent funding by the U.S. Government, our potential cash exposure and
termination liability were not material at December 31, 2016. However, it may become material if government appropriations are delayed as was the case in
the second and third quarters of 2016.
2015 compared to 2014
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.2 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower pension contributions, partially offset
by decreases in working capital and higher tax payments. The $1.8 billion increase in cash flows related to other, net in the table above is primarily because
we made no contributions to our heritage qualified defined benefit pension trust in 2015 compared to $2.0 billion in 2014. We made $5.0 million in
contributions to our new Sikorsky bargained qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2015. The increase in cash flows related to other, net was offset by
higher federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds received, of approximately $210 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to the
absence of refunds received in 2015 (prior year’s tax refunds were attributable to timing of discretionary pension contributions made during the fourth quarter
of the respective previous years). The $474 million decrease in cash flows related to working capital (defined as receivables and inventories less accounts
payable
 
46
Table of Contents
and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) was attributable to an increase in receivables due to timing of customer collections (primarily
F-35 contracts) as well as timing of production and billing cycles affecting customer advances and progress payments applied to inventories (primarily C-130
program).
Investing Activities
Net cash used for investing activities decreased $8.7 billion in 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to $9.0 billion of cash used for acquisition
activities in 2015 that did not recur in 2016. Net cash used for investing activities increased $8.0 billion in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to cash used
for acquisition activities. Acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. We had no acquisitions in 2016. In
2015 we paid $9.0 billion for the Sikorsky acquisition, net of cash acquired. In 2014, we paid $898 million for acquisition activities, primarily related to the
acquisitions of Zeta, Systems Made Simple, and Industrial Defender (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).
Capital expenditures amounted to $1.1 billion in 2016, $939 million in 2015 and $845 million in 2014. The majority of our capital expenditures were for
equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur
capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the
development or purchase of internal-use-software.
Additionally, in 2015, we received cash proceeds of approximately $165 million related to three properties sold in California.
Financing Activities
Net cash used for financing activities increased $7.7 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in
2015 which did not recur in 2016, the repayments of long-term debt in 2016, and higher dividend payments, partially offset by the proceeds from the one-time
special cash payment of $1.8 billion from the divestiture of the IS&GS business and a reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock.
Net cash provided by financing activities increased $7.6 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to proceeds from new debt issuances, partially
offset by increased repurchases of common stock and higher dividends paid.
In May 2016, we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities.
In September 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities.
In February 2015, we received net proceeds of $2.21 billion for the issuance of $2.25 billion of fixed interest-rate long-term notes. In November 2015,
we borrowed $7.0 billion of fixed interest-rate long-term notes and received net proceeds of $6.9 billion (the November 2015 Notes). These proceeds were
used to repay $6.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under a 364-day revolving credit facility that was used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the
Sikorsky acquisition. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2015, to partially finance the Sikorsky acquisition we borrowed and repaid approximately
$1.0 billion under our commercial paper program. See the “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our debt financing activities.
We paid dividends totaling $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share) in 2016, $1.9 billion ($6.15 per share) in 2015 and $1.8 billion ($5.49 per share) in 2014. We
have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years, including a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter of 2016.
We declared quarterly dividends of $1.65 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and $1.82 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016; $1.50
per share during each of the first three quarters of 2015 and $1.65 per share during the fourth quarter of 2015; and $1.33 per share during each of the first
three quarters of 2014 and $1.50 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014.
We paid $2.1 billion, $3.1 billion and $1.9 billion to repurchase 8.9 million, 15.2 million and 11.5 million shares of our common stock during 2016, 2015
and 2014.

Table of Contents
Cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with employee stock option exercises during 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled
$106 million, $174 million and $308 million. The exercises resulted in the issuance of 1.2 million, 2.2 million and 3.7 million shares of our common stock.
Capital Structure, Resources and Other
At December 31, 2016, we held cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $400 million of our cash and cash
equivalents was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. Although those balances are generally available to fund ordinary business operations without
legal or other restrictions, a significant portion is not immediately available to fund U.S. operations unless repatriated. Our intention is to permanently
reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. While we do not intend to do so, if this cash had been repatriated at the end of 2016, we estimate that about
$64 million of U.S. federal income tax would have been due after considering foreign tax credits.
Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, amounted to $14.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and mainly is in the form of
publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit
agreements.
We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We
review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance
existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.
On occasion, customers may seek financing for the purchase of our products. In connection with these transactions, we may enter into arrangements
along with our customers with unrelated third – party financial institutions to facilitate the non-recourse sale of customer receivables. For accounting
purposes, these transactions are treated as a sale of receivables and the sale proceeds from the banks are reflected in our operating cash flows on the
consolidated statements of cash flows. During 2016, there was no significant activity related to sales of customer receivables.
Revolving Credit Facilities
On October 9, 2015, we entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year Facility) with various banks. The 5-year Facility, was
amended in October 2016 to extend its expiration date by one year from October 9, 2020 to October 9, 2021. The 5-year Facility is available for general
corporate purposes. The undrawn portion of the 5-year Facility is also available to serve as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. We may
request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase to the credit facility up to an additional $500 million. There were no borrowings outstanding
under the 5-year Facility as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Borrowings under the 5-year Facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the
5-year Facility’s agreement. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the 5-year Facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various
representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant
not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5-year Facility agreement.
Long-Term Debt
See “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our long-term debt.
We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of
an indeterminate amount of debt securities.
Commercial Paper
We have agreements in place with financial institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion credit facility. During
2016, we borrowed and fully repaid amounts under our commercial paper programs. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of
December 31, 2016. However, we expect to continue to issue commercial paper backed by our credit facility to manage the timing of our cash flows.

Table of Contents
Total Equity
Our total equity was $1.6 billion at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.5 billion from December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the
9.4 million common shares tendered and retired in connection with the divestiture of our IS&GS business for $2.5 billion; the repurchase of 8.9 million
common shares for $2.1 billion; and dividends declared of $2.0 billion during the year. These decreases were partially offset by net earnings of $5.3 billion
and employee stock activity of $399 million (including the impacts of stock option exercises, ESOP activity and stock-based compensation).
As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over
par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in
capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $1.7 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in
2016.
Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2016, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to
purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and
commitments are as follows (in millions):
 
   Payments Due By Period  
    Total       Less Than
1 Year     Years  
2 and 3     Years  
4 and 5     After

Long-term debt (a)    $15,228            $ —      $1,650      $2,150      $11,428        
Interest payments    10,602         630       1,245       1,120       7,607

Capital expenditures    229         168       54       7       —        
Total contractual cash obligations    $68,101            $21,305      $17,032      $7,359      $22,405        
 
(a) Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only and excludes approximately $13 million of debt issued by a consolidated joint venture, for which the debt is
not guaranteed by us.
Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2016. Such amounts
mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans.
Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or
nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related
to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table
include approximately $33 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The
U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts
“for convenience” under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform
subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with
foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts
with commercial customers.
Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include facilities infrastructure, equipment and information technology.
We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products
and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign
country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use
cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties
 
49
Table of Contents
(e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing
supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of ventures with local companies and building or leasing
facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts
ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction
of the original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract
and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset
obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar
to our business activities. At December 31, 2016, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately
$15 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments, most of which extend through 2044. To the extent we have entered
into purchase obligations at December 31, 2016 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually
extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2016, in the event we fail to perform in
accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the
result of negotiations and subjective judgments.
In connection with our 50% ownership interest of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) are required to provide ULA an additional capital
contribution if ULA is unable to make required payments under its inventory supply agreement with Boeing. As of December 31, 2016, ULA’s total
remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agreement was $120 million. The parties have agreed to defer the remaining payment obligation as
it is more than offset by other commitments to ULA. Accordingly, we do not expect to be required to make a capital contribution to ULA under this
agreement.
In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other for guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA
under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2016, and that it
will not be necessary to make payments under the
cross-indemnities or guarantees.
We have entered into standby letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees with financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating
to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available
for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as venture partners. At
December 31, 2016, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions):
 
   Commitment Expiration By Period  
    Total      
Commitment   Less Than

Total commitments    $3,738     $1,612         $1,169     $385     $572        
 
(a) Approximately $850 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category , $554 million in the “Years 2 and 3” category and $295 million in the “Years 4
and 5” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.
At December 31, 2016, third-party guarantees totaled $709 million, of which approximately 56% related to guarantees of contractual performance of
ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon
the contractual non-performance of the venture partners. In addition, we generally have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that
may be paid on behalf of a venture partner. We believe our current and former venture partners will be able to perform their obligations, as they have done
through December 31, 2016, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the guarantees. In determining our exposures, we evaluate the
reputation, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former venture partners.

Critical Accounting Policies
Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition
Substantially all of our net sales are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method, which requires that significant estimates and assumptions
be made in accounting for the contracts. Our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we
account for under a services accounting model.
We evaluate new or significantly modified contracts with customers other than the U.S. Government, to the extent the contracts include multiple
elements, to determine if the individual deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting. When we determine that accounting for the
deliverables as separate units is appropriate, we allocate the contract value to the deliverables based on their relative estimated selling prices. The contracts or
contract modifications we evaluate for multiple elements typically are long-term in nature and include the provision of both products and services. Based on
the nature of our business, we generally account for components of such contracts using the percentage-of-completion accounting model or the services
accounting model, as appropriate.
We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the underlying contract.
Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to international governments
contracted through the U.S. Government.
Contract Types
Our contracts generally record sales for both products and services under cost-reimbursable, fixed-price and time-and-materials contracts.
Cost-reimbursable contracts
Cost-reimbursable contracts, which accounted for about 38%, 42%, and 41% of our total net sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014, provide for the payment of
allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee, up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. We generate revenue under
two general types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee/incentive-fee contracts, which represent a substantial majority of our cost-reimbursable
contracts; and cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.
Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against
a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for
reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (incentive based on
cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (incentive based on performance). The fixed fee in a
cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs.
Fixed-price
Under fixed-price contracts, which accounted for about 61%, 57%, and 58% of our total net sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014, we agree to perform the
specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more
or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur
financial penalties based on our performance.
Percentage-of-Completion Method
We record net sales and an estimated profit on a percentage-of-completion basis for cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts for product and services
contracts with the U.S. Government.
The percentage-of-completion method for product contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract. For example, for
contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and/or to deliver minimal
quantities, sales are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method, we recognize sales and an
estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. For contracts that require us to provide a
 
51
Table of Contents
substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and an estimated profit on a percentage-of-completion basis
using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. For contracts to provide services to the U.S. Government, sales are
generally recorded using the cost-to-cost method.
Award and incentive fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted
for under the percentage-of-completion method. Estimates of award fees are based on past experience and anticipated performance. We record incentives or
penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely
on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs.
Accounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs
(including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance) and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the
number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the
estimation of total sales and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and, accordingly, is subject to change. When adjustments in
estimated total contract sales or estimated total costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the
inception-to-date effect of such changes.
Our estimates of costs at completion of the contract are based on assumptions we make for variables such as labor productivity and availability, the
complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for
materials), performance by our subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. When estimates of total
costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of sales to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which
the loss is determined.
Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to
the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the
contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g.,
the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation
agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each
contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the
contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost
aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated
total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit
booking rate.
In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit
booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically
referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely,
conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate.
Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating
profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters,
cost recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of
contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions as mentioned above which are excluded from segment operating results;
reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of assets. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit
booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes.
Services Method
Under a fixed-price service contract, we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for
the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss. We record net sales under fixed-price service contracts to non-U.S. Government
customers on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in
a different pattern. For cost-reimbursable contracts for services to non-U.S. Government customers that provide for award and incentive fees, we
 
52
Table of Contents
record net sales as services are performed, exclusive of award and incentive fees. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable,
generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer. This approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals
(typically every six months) throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer’s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal
notifications. Costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred.
Other Contract Accounting Considerations
The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S.
Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for
goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain
advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements
with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the
environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and
administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.
We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and
allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit
Agency.
Postretirement Benefit Plans
Overview
Many of our employees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other
postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans – see “Note 11 – Postretirement Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans.
We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our
consolidated balance sheets. There is a corresponding non-cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax benefits recorded as deferred
tax assets, in stockholders’ equity. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of
the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on
past service.
In June 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees to freeze future retirement
benefits. The freeze will take effect in two stages. Beginning on January 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement
benefits was frozen so that future pay increases, annual incentive bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after December 31, 2015 will not
be used to calculate retirement benefits. On January 1, 2020, the service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be
frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited service for any period after December 31, 2019. When the freeze is complete, the majority of
our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.
Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the
funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as
changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including
participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.
Actuarial Assumptions
The plan assets and benefit obligations are measured at the end of each year or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a
significant plan amendment, settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key
assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, employee turnover and the health care cost
trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the
calculation of
 
53
Table of Contents
net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments
about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan
participants.
We continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans
resulting in 4.125% at December 31, 2016, compared to 4.375% at December 31, 2015 and 4.00% at December 31, 2014. We utilized a weighted average
discount rate of 4.00% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical plans at December 31, 2016, compared to 4.25% at
December 31, 2015 and 3.75% at December 31, 2014. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate weighted average discount rate,
including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our
evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan
cash flows.
We utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.50% at December 31, 2016, as compared to 8.00% at December 31, 2015 and
December 31, 2014. We reduced our expected long-term rate of return assumption due to downward pressure on the equity and fixed income asset classes in
our trust. An increasingly aging population and debt burden place downward pressure on already low interest rates and economic growth; suggesting the
future return for our fixed-income may be lower than historical norms. Surges in equities since 2009 have led to a high valuation of the equity markets,
suggesting the forward return may also be lower than historical norms. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of
return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors
including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and
the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return
on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods.
Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be
approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of
variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes
in the discount rate.
On October 20, 2016, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies of longevity. We used the revised
assumptions indicating a shortened longevity in our December 31, 2016 remeasurement of benefit obligation. The publication was a refinement to the
assumptions the Society of Actuaries published in October 2014 and October 2015 that we previously adopted beginning year 2014.
Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $12.0 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement
benefit plans. The cumulative non-cash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates, investment
losses and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used
to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor
method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over the average future
service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately nine years as of December 31, 2016. This amortization period is
expected to extend (approximately double) in 2020 when our non-union pension plan is completely frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of the
participants instead of average future service. During 2016, $699 million of these amounts was recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans
expense and about $800 million is expected to be recognized as expense in 2017.
The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment.
A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 4.125% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2016, with all other assumptions held constant, would
have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2016 by approximately $1.5 billion, which
would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.0 billion. If the 4.125% discount rate at
December 31, 2016 that was used to compute the expected 2017 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis
points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2017 would be lower or higher by
approximately $120 million. If the 7.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2016 that was used to compute the
expected 2017 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held
constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2017 would be lower or higher by approximately $80 million.
 
54
Table of Contents
Each year, differences between the actual plan asset return and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following
year’s FAS expense. Every 100 basis points difference in return during 2016 between our actual return of 5.0% and our expected long-term rate of return of
8.0% impacted 2017 FAS pension expense by approximately $20 million.
Funding Considerations
There were no contributions to our heritage qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2016 and 2015. We made contributions related to our heritage
qualified defined benefit pension plans of $2.0 billion in 2014 inclusive of amounts in excess of our required contributions. Funding of our qualified defined
benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined
under the PPA. The ERISA funded status is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP. As a result of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st
Century Act of 2012 (MAP-21), which included a provision that changed the methodology for calculating the interest rate assumption used in determining the
minimum funding requirements under the PPA, there was an increase in the interest rate assumption, which in turn lowered the minimum funding
requirements. On August 8, 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA) was enacted; and on November 2, 2015, the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2015; which extend the methodology put in place by MAP-21 to calculate the interest rate assumption so that the impact will begin to decrease
in 2021 and phase out by 2024. This has the effect of lowering our minimum funding requirements during the affected periods from what they otherwise
would have been. The ERISA funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was about 87% and 90% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The
GAAP funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was about 70% and 73% at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government
contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and
recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. We recovered $2.0 billion in 2016, $1.6 billion in 2015, and $1.5 billion in 2014 as
CAS pension costs. Effective February 27, 2012, CAS rules were revised to better align the recovery of pension costs, including prepayment credits, on U.S.
Government contracts with the minimum funding requirements of the PPA (referred to as CAS Harmonization). Specifically, CAS Harmonization shortened
the amortization period for allocating gains and losses to U.S. Government contracts from 15 to 10 years and requires the use of an interest rate to determine
CAS pension cost consistent with the interest rate used to determine minimum pension funding requirements under the PPA. While the change in the
amortization period was applicable beginning in 2013, there is a transition period for the impact of the change in the CAS liability measurement due to the
revised interest rate that will be phased in with the full impact occurring in 2017. We expect the incremental impact of CAS Harmonization will increase
successively through 2017, primarily due to the liability measurement transition period included in the amended rule. The enactment of the HATFA and
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 also increased the interest rate assumption used to determine our CAS pension costs, which has the effect of lowering the
recovery of pension contributions during the affected periods as it decreases our CAS pension costs.
Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made under the PPA. Amounts contributed in excess
of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. As of December 31,
2016, our prepayment credits were approximately $7.7 billion as compared to $9.0 billion at December 31, 2015. The recovery of CAS pension costs under
U.S. Government contracts in excess of our contributions reduces the prepayment credit balance. The prepayment credit balance will also increase or decrease
based on our actual investment return on plan assets.
Trends
We do not plan to make contributions to our heritage pension plans in 2017 because none are required using current assumptions, including investment
returns on plan assets. However, we do plan to make contributions of approximately $45 million in 2017 to our new Sikorsky bargained qualified defined
benefit pension plan. Pension contributions to our heritage plans are expected to resume with contributions projected of about $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion in
2018 using current assumptions including investment returns on plan assets. We anticipate recovering almost $2.3 billion of CAS pension cost in 2017 with a
higher CAS recovery projected in 2018. Since the annual amount of CAS cost is more than our planned cash funding in each of these years, we will recover a
portion of the $7.7 billion of prepayment credits existing at December 31, 2016.
We expect our 2017 FAS pension expense to be $1.4 billion, as compared to our 2016 FAS pension expense of $1.0 billion, primarily due to the lower
discount rate of 4.125% for 2017 versus 4.375% for 2016 and lower expected long-
 
55
Table of Contents
term rate of return on plan assets of 7.50% at December 31, 2016 versus 8.00% at December 31, 2015. We expect a FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2017 of
about $880 million, as compared to $902 million in 2016. The increase in 2017 FAS pension expense is mostly offset by higher 2017 CAS pension costs, as
compared to 2016, due to CAS Harmonization.
Environmental Matters
We are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where
we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). At each of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our
consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $1.0 billion. We have recorded receivables totaling $870 million and $858 million at December 31,
2016 and 2015 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S.
Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be
recoverable under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.
We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation.
We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of
our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing
remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the
appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving governmental environmental standards.
We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting
Policies” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the
above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities, which results in the
calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash
payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts
could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our
estimate of the extent of contamination).
The current standard in California for the maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water is 10 parts per billion (ppb). This
standard is being challenged by the California Manufacturers and Technology Association (CMTA) as being lower than is required to protect public health. If
the standard remains at 10 ppb, it will not have a material impact on our existing remediation costs in California. The U.S. EPA is considering whether to
regulate hexavalent chromium.
In addition, California is reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.
EPA) is taking steps to regulate perchlorate in drinking water. If substantially lower standards are adopted, in either California or at the federal level for
perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium, we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of
the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be
allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may
have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.
Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as
general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government
business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result,
most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the
contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other
factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and recent
efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.
As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our
environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding
 
56
Table of Contents
environmental receivable and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the
corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is
determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government.
We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former
operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at
this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the
contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a
particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable
with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.
If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be
shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree
among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible
parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were
required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the
other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from
other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation.
Goodwill
The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses.
Our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion and $10.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least
annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such
events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a
decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or
the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit,
which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine
whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment
management regularly reviews the operating results.
We may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative
approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment.
Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further
evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once
every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.
Under step one of the quantitative two step impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the
fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
value, we then perform step two of the quantitative impairment test and compare the implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of
its goodwill. The implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is calculated by creating a hypothetical balance sheet as if the reporting unit had just been
acquired. This balance sheet contains all assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (including any assumed intangible assets that may not have any
corresponding carrying value in our balance sheet). The implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the net
assets from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied value of that goodwill, an impairment
loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
 
57
Table of Contents
We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation
methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the
exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant
comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on our best
estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders,
expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance.
The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the
relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider
the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in
its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of our 2016 annual
impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed. The carrying value of our Sikorsky reporting unit includes goodwill of $2.7 billion as of
December 31, 2016. Currently, we estimate that the fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by a margin of approximately 10%.
We acquired Sikorsky in November 2015 and recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. Due to the recent acquisition and valuation,
the carrying value and fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit are currently closely aligned. Therefore, any business deterioration, contract cancelations or
terminations, or market pressures could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections. Similarly, market factors utilized in the
impairment analysis, including long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and transaction multiples,
could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units. Based on our current assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that our Sikorsky
reporting unit is at risk of a future goodwill impairment should there be deterioration of projected cash flows, negative changes in market factors or a
significant increase in the carrying value of the reporting unit.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. In connection with our fourth quarter
2015 program realignment, goodwill was reallocated between affected reporting units on a relative fair value basis. We performed goodwill impairment tests
prior and subsequent to the realignment. The results of our 2015 annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed.
Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many
variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a
material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and consist of customer programs,
trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired
businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated
program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value, which ranges from nine to 20 years.
Acquired intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing compares carrying value to
fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the
applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future
net cash inflows.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed the annual impairment test for the Sikorsky indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset and the results
indicated that no impairment existed. The carrying value of our Sikorsky reporting unit includes a trademark intangible asset of $887 million as of
December 31, 2016. Using the relief from royalty method, we estimated that the fair value of this intangible asset approximated its carrying value. As
discussed above in the Goodwill section, the carrying value and fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit are currently closely aligned due to the recent
acquisition of Sikorsky. Therefore, any business deterioration, contract cancelations or terminations, or market pressures could cause our sales to decline
below current projections. Based on our current assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that our Sikorsky trademark intangible asset is at risk
of a future impairment.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with
sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and
actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring
availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.
Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial
instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was
$16.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and the outstanding principal amount was $15.3 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of
$1.0 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2016.
We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We
do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with
changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign
currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the
Australian dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated
with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest
rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate
borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to LIBOR in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For
variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate
the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not
designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.
The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its
resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings
and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the
hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges, or of
derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our
outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign
currency hedges at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net fair value of our derivative
instruments was not material (see “Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements”) included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% appreciation or
devaluation of the hedged currency as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract at December 31, 2016 would not have a
material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements.
We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable
credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically
monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2016,
investments in the trust totaled $1.2 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds
investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the
liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and
certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the
change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other
unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2016.

ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Report of Ernst & Young LLP,
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,
on the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Lockheed Martin Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lockheed Martin Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Lockheed Martin
Corporation at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Lockheed Martin
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 9, 2017 expressed an
adverse opinion thereon.

Lockheed Martin Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies
Organization – We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and
sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific,
logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil
and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government.
Basis of presentation – Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest entities if we are the
primary beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. Our receivables, inventories, customer advances and amounts in
excess of costs incurred and certain amounts in other current liabilities primarily are attributable to long-term contracts or programs in progress for which the
related operating cycles are longer than one year. In accordance with industry practice, we include these items in current assets and current liabilities. Unless
otherwise noted, we present all per share amounts cited in these consolidated financial statements on a “per diluted share” basis. Certain prior period amounts
have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.
The discussion and presentation of the operating results of our business segments have been impacted by the following recent events.
On August 16, 2016, we completed the previously announced divestiture of the Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business, which
merged with a subsidiary of Leidos Holdings, Inc. (Leidos), in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the “Transaction”). This Transaction represents the
culmination of the strategic review of our government information technology infrastructure services business and our technical services business performed
in 2015 to explore whether the IS&GS business could achieve greater growth and create more value for customers and stockholders outside of Lockheed
Martin. As a result of the divestiture, the operating results of the IS&GS business have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated
statements of earnings for all periods presented and the assets and liabilities of the IS&GS business have been classified as assets and liabilities of
discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. However, the cash flows of the IS&GS business have not been
reclassified in our consolidated statements of cash flows as we retained the cash as part of the Transaction. See “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” for
additional information about the divestiture of the IS&GS business.
On August 24, 2016, our ownership interest in the AWE Management Limited (AWE) venture, which operates the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent
program, increased by 18%. As a result of the increase, we now hold a 51% controlling interest in AWE and are required to consolidate the AWE venture in
our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows of AWE have been included in our consolidated statements of
earnings and consolidated statements of cash flows since August 24, 2016, the date we obtained a controlling interest, and the assets and liabilities of AWE
are included in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. Previously, we accounted for our investment in AWE using the equity method of
accounting. See “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” for additional information about the change in ownership of AWE.
During the third quarter of 2016, the business segment formerly known as Mission Systems and Training (MST) was renamed Rotary and Missions
Systems (RMS) to better reflect a broader range of products and capabilities subsequent to the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) in
November 2015 and the realignment of certain programs from the former IS&GS business to RMS in the fourth quarter of 2015. While RMS was renamed to
more accurately reflect the expanded portfolio, there was no additional change to the composition of the portfolio in connection with the name change. The
information for this segment for all periods included in these consolidated financial statements has been labeled using the new name.
On November 6, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Sikorsky for $9.0 billion, net of cash acquired, and aligned Sikorsky under our RMS business
segment. The operating results and cash flows of Sikorsky have been included in our consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of cash
flows since the November 6, 2015 acquisition date. Additionally, the assets and liabilities of Sikorsky are included in our consolidated balance sheets as of
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. See “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” for additional information about the acquisition of Sikorsky and
related final purchase accounting.

Table of Contents
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we realigned certain programs among our business segments. The amounts, discussion and presentation of our
business segments for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements reflect the program realignment.
Use of estimates – We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In doing
so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We
base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results
may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not
limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition, postretirement benefit plans, environmental receivables and liabilities, evaluation of goodwill and other
assets for impairment, income taxes including deferred tax assets, fair value measurements and contingencies.
Sales and earnings – We record net sales and estimated profits for substantially all of our contracts using the percentage-of-completion method for cost-
reimbursable and fixed-price contracts for products and services with the U.S. Government. Sales are recorded on all time-and-materials contracts as the work
is performed based on agreed-upon hourly rates and allowable costs. We account for our services contracts with non-U.S. Government customers using the
services method of accounting. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the attributes of the
underlying contracts.
Percentage-of-Completion Method – The percentage-of-completion method for product contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under
the contract. For example, for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract
and/or to deliver minimal quantities, sales are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method
of accounting, we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. For
contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and an estimated profit
on a percentage-of-completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. For contracts to provide services
to the U.S. Government, sales are generally recorded using the cost-to-cost method.
Award and incentive fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted
for under the percentage-of-completion method. Estimates of award fees are based on past experience and anticipated performance. We record incentives or
penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely
on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs.
Accounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs
(including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance) and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the
number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the
estimation of total sales and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and, accordingly, is subject to change. When adjustments in
estimated total contract sales or estimated total costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the
inception-to-date effect of such changes. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total sales to be earned, a provision for
the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to
the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the
contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g.,
the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation
agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each
contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the
contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost
aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated
total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit
booking rate.

Table of Contents
In addition, comparability of our business segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted by changes in profit booking rates on
our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk
retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a
particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or
decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and
margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost
recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual
matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions (such as those mentioned below in “Note 15 – Restructuring Charges”), which are
excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of assets. Segment operating profit and items such as
risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes.
Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, net of state income taxes,
increased segment operating profit, by approximately $1.5 billion in 2016, $1.7 billion in 2015 and $1.6 billion in 2014. These adjustments increased net
earnings by approximately $950 million ($3.13 per share) in 2016, $1.1 billion ($3.50 per share) in 2015 and $1.1 billion ($3.41 per share) in 2014.
Services Method – For cost-reimbursable contracts for services to non-U.S. Government customers, we record net sales as services are performed, except
for award and incentive fees. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable, generally at the date the amount is communicated to
us by the customer. This approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals (typically every six months) throughout the contract and is
dependent on the customer’s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications. Under fixed-price service contracts, we are paid a
predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting
profit or loss. We record net sales under fixed-price service contracts with non-U.S. Government customers on a straight-line basis over the period of contract
performance, unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs for all service contracts are
expensed as incurred.
Research and development and similar costs – Except for certain arrangements described below, we account for independent research and
development costs as part of the general and administrative costs that are allocated among all of our contracts and programs in progress under U.S.
Government contractual arrangements and charged to cost of sales. Under certain arrangements in which a customer shares in product development costs, our
portion of unreimbursed costs is expensed as incurred in cost of sales. Independent research and development costs charged to cost of sales totaled
$988 million in 2016, $817 million in 2015 and $733 million in 2014. Costs we incur under customer-sponsored research and development programs pursuant
to contracts are included in net sales and cost of sales.
Stock-based compensation – Compensation cost related to all share-based payments is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of
the award. We generally recognize the compensation cost ratably over a three-year vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. At each reporting date, the
number of shares is adjusted to the number ultimately expected to vest.
Income taxes – We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as from operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.
We periodically assess our tax exposures related to periods that are open to examination. Based on the latest available information, we evaluate our tax
positions to determine whether the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other taxing
authorities. If we cannot reach a more-likely-than-not determination, no benefit is recorded. If we determine that the tax position is more likely than not to be
sustained, we record the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled. We record interest and penalties
related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Interest and penalties were not material.
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash equivalents include highly liquid instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less.
 
69
Table of Contents
Receivables – Receivables include amounts billed and currently due from customers and unbilled costs and accrued profits primarily related to sales on
long-term contracts that have been recognized but not yet billed to customers. Pursuant to contract provisions, agencies of the U.S. Government and certain
other customers have title to, or a security interest in, assets related to such contracts as a result of advances, performance-based payments and progress
payments. We reflect those advances and payments as an offset to the related receivables balance for contracts that we account for on a
percentage-of-completion basis using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion.
On occasion, customers may seek financing for the purchase of our products. In connection with these transactions, we may enter into arrangements
along with our customers with unrelated third–party financial institutions to facilitate the non-recourse sale of customer receivables. For accounting purposes,
these transactions are treated as a sale of receivables and the sale proceeds from the banks are reflected in our operating cash flows on the statement of cash
flows. During 2016, there was no significant activity related to sales of customer receivables.
Inventories – We record inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Costs on long-term contracts and programs in progress
represent recoverable costs incurred for production or contract-specific facilities and equipment, allocable operating overhead, advances to suppliers and, in
the case of contracts with the U.S. Government and substantially all other governments, research and development and general and administrative expenses.
Pursuant to contract provisions, agencies of the U.S. Government and certain other customers have title to, or a security interest in, inventories related to such
contracts as a result of advances, performance-based payments and progress payments. We reflect those advances and payments as an offset against the
related inventory balances for contracts that we account for on a percentage-of-completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress
toward completing the contract. We determine the costs of other product and supply inventories by the first-in first-out or average cost methods.
Property, plant and equipment – We record property, plant and equipment at cost. We provide for depreciation and amortization on plant and
equipment generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets and the straight-line method thereafter. The
estimated useful lives of our plant and equipment generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for machinery and equipment. No
depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such assets are placed into operation. Depreciation expense related to plant and equipment
was $747 million in 2016, $716 million in 2015 and $713 million in 2014.
We review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets for impairment if events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. We assess impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the related asset grouping to its
carrying amount. If an asset is determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of
the asset and its carrying amount.
Capitalized software – We capitalize certain costs associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software. The amounts capitalized are
included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting
software, which ranges from two to six years. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, capitalized software totaled $427 million and $473 million, net of
accumulated amortization of $1.9 billion in each of the years. No amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for its intended use.
Amortization expense related to capitalized software was $136 million in 2016, $161 million in 2015 and $194 million in 2014.
Goodwill – The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the
date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses.
We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter and more frequently whenever certain events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in
overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators,
competition, reorganizations of our business or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for
impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test
goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a business for which discrete financial
information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
We may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. Under the qualitative approach, for selected reporting
units we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the
 
70
Table of Contents
reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair
value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test. For
certain reporting units we only perform a quantitative impairment test.
Under step one of the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair
value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
value, we then perform step two of the quantitative impairment test and compare the implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of
its goodwill. The implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is calculated by creating a hypothetical balance sheet as if the reporting unit had just been
acquired. This balance sheet contains all assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (including any intangible assets that may not have any corresponding
carrying value in our balance sheet). The implied value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the net assets from the
fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation
methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the
exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and
relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on our
best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm
orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long-term business plans and recent operating
performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into
account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate
to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of our 2016 annual
impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we
realigned certain programs between our business segments in connection with our strategic review of our government IT and technical services businesses. As
part of the realignment, goodwill was reallocated between affected reporting units on a relative fair value basis. We performed goodwill impairment tests prior
and subsequent to the realignment. The results of our 2015 annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of these tests indicated that
the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, with the exception of our Technical Services reporting unit within our IS&GS
business. The impact of market pressures such as lower in-theater support as troop levels are drawn down and increased re-competition on existing contracts
that are awarded primarily on the basis of price adversely impacted the fair value of this reporting unit. As a result, we compared the implied value of that
reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of its goodwill, and since the carrying value exceeded the implied value, we recorded a non-cash impairment
charge of $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 equal to that differential. The impairment charge of $119 million was reclassified in connection with the
divestiture of the IS&GS business and reclassification of the IS&GS business to discontinued operations.
Intangible assets – Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and consist of
customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major
programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks
underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value, which
ranges from nine to 20 years. Acquired intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This
testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. Finite-lived intangibles are
amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic
benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows.
 
71
Table of Contents
Customer advances and amounts in excess of cost incurred – We receive advances, performance-based payments and progress payments from
customers that may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts, including contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government. We classify such advances, other
than those reflected as a reduction of receivables or inventories as discussed above, as current liabilities.
Postretirement benefit plans – Many of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans and we provide certain health care and life
insurance benefits to eligible retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). GAAP requires that the amounts we record related to our postretirement
benefit plans be computed, based on service to date, using actuarial valuations that are based in part on certain key economic assumptions we make, including
the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as
mortality) estimates, health care cost trend rates and employee turnover, each as appropriate based on the nature of the plans.
A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of
deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These asset gains or losses, along with those resulting from adjustments to our benefit obligation, will be
amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit
obligations, over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately 9 years as of December 31,
2016. This amortization period is expected to extend (approximately double) in 2020 when our non-union pension plan is frozen to use the average remaining
life expectancy of the participants instead of average future service.
We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset recorded within other
noncurrent assets or a liability recorded within noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. There is a corresponding non-cash adjustment to
accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax benefits recorded as deferred tax assets, in stockholders’ equity. The GAAP funded status is measured as the
difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The funded status under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP.
Environmental matters – We record a liability for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the costs to be incurred for remediation at a particular site. We do not
discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Our environmental
liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets within other liabilities, both current and noncurrent. We expect to include a substantial portion of
environmental costs in our net sales and cost of sales in future periods pursuant to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. At the time a liability is
recorded for future environmental costs, we record a receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of products and
services to agencies of the U.S. Government, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continuously evaluate the
recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and
contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and recent efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.
We include the portion of those environmental costs expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts, or that is determined to not be
recoverable under U.S. Government contracts, in our cost of sales at the time the liability is established. Our environmental receivables are recorded on our
consolidated balance sheets within other assets, both current and noncurrent. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.
Investments in marketable securities – Investments in marketable securities consist of debt and equity securities and are classified as trading securities.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of our trading securities totaled $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion and was included in other noncurrent assets on
our consolidated balance sheets. Our trading securities are held in a separate trust, which includes investments to fund our deferred compensation plan
liabilities. Net gains on trading securities in 2016 were $66 million, net losses on trading securities in 2015 were $11 million and net gains on trading
securities in 2014 were $65 million. Gains and losses on these investments are included in other unallocated, net within cost of sales on our consolidated
statements of earnings in order to align the classification of changes in the market value of investments held for the plan with changes in the value of the
corresponding plan liabilities.
Equity method investments – Investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for under the
equity method of accounting and are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Significant influence typically exists if we have a
20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. Under this method of accounting, our share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is included in
operating profit in other income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings since the activities of the investee are closely aligned
 
72
Table of Contents
with the operations of the business segment holding the investment. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is
determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our equity method investments
totaled $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, which primarily are composed of our Space Systems business segment’s investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA),
see “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies”, and our Aeronautics and RMS business segments’ investments in the Advanced
Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center (AMMROC) venture. Our share of net earnings related to our equity method investees was $443 million
in 2016, $320 million in 2015 and $327 million in 2014, of which approximately $325 million, $245 million and $280 million related to our Space Systems
business segment.
Derivative financial instruments – We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are
subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that
change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in
our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also
are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate
swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as
fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings
in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative
instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.
We record derivatives at their fair value. The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our
intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of
hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated
other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the
ineffective portion of the hedges or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The
aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. The aggregate notional
amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion. Derivative instruments did not have a
material impact on net earnings and comprehensive income during 2016, 2015 and 2014. Substantially all of our derivatives are designated for hedge
accounting. See “Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements” for more information on the fair value measurements related to our derivative instruments.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements – In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (Topic 606) (the ASU), which will change the way we recognize revenue and
significantly expand the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the
ASU to 2018 for public companies, with an option that would permit companies to adopt the ASU in 2017. Further amendments and technical corrections
were made to the ASU during 2016. This ASU may be adopted using the full retrospective method, whereby the ASU would be applied to each prior year
presented and the cumulative effect of applying the ASU would be recognized at the beginning of the earliest year presented or the modified retrospective
method, whereby the cumulative effect of applying the ASU would be recognized at the beginning of the year of adoption. We will adopt the requirements of
the new standard effective January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective transition method.
As the ASU will supersede substantially all existing revenue guidance affecting us under GAAP, it could impact revenue and cost recognition on
thousands of contracts across all of our business segments, as well as, our business processes and our information technology systems. As a result, our
evaluation of the effect of the ASU will extend through 2017. We have closely monitored the standard setting process, including amendments and technical
corrections to the ASU following its issuance in May 2014 and participated in aerospace and defense forums to understand the impact of the ASU on our
industry.
We commenced our evaluation of the impact of the ASU in late 2014, by evaluating its impact on selected contracts at each of our business segments.
With this baseline understanding, we developed a project plan to evaluate thousands of contracts across our business segments, develop processes and tools to
dual report financial results under both GAAP and the
 
73
Table of Contents
ASU and assess the internal control structure in order to adopt the ASU on January 1, 2018. We have periodically briefed our Audit Committee on our
progress made towards adoption. Based on our evaluation to date, we anticipate being able to estimate the impacts of adopting the ASU in the second half of
2017.
We recognize the majority of our revenue using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, whereby revenue is recognized as we progress on
the contract. For contracts with a significant amount of development and/or requiring the delivery of a minimal number of units, revenue and profit is
recognized using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress. For example, we use this method in Aeronautics for the F-35
program; in MFC for the THAAD program; in RMS for the Littoral Combat Ship and Aegis Combat System programs; and in Space Systems for government
satellite programs. For contracts that require us to produce a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record
revenue and profit using the percentage-of-completion units-of-delivery as the basis for measuring progress on the contract. For example, we use this method
in Aeronautics for the C-130J and C-5 programs; in MFC for tactical missile programs (i.e., Hellfire, JASSM), PAC-3 programs and fire control programs
(i.e., LANTIRN, Sniper); in RMS for Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopter programs; and in Space Systems for commercial satellite programs. For contracts
to provide services to the U.S. Government, revenue is generally recorded using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method.
Under the ASU, revenue will be recognized as the customer obtains control of the goods and services promised in the contract (i.e., performance
obligations). Given the nature of our products and terms and conditions in our contracts, in particular those with the U. S. Government (including FMS
contracts), the customer obtains control as we perform on the contract. Therefore, we expect to recognize revenue over time for almost all of our contracts
using a method similar to our current percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Accordingly, adoption of the ASU will primarily impact our contracts
where revenue is currently recognized using the percentage-of-completion units-of-delivery method, with the resulting impact being revenue will be
recognized earlier in the performance period as we incur costs, as opposed to when units are delivered. This change will also impact our balance sheet
presentation with an expected decrease in inventories, an increase in contract assets (i.e., unbilled receivables) and a net increase to retained earnings to
primarily reflect the impact of converting units-of-delivery contracts to the cost-to-cost method for recognizing revenue and profits.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which will simplify the goodwill impairment
calculation, by eliminating Step 2 from the current goodwill impairment test. The new standard does not change how a goodwill impairment is identified. We
will continue to perform our quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, but if we are
required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, under the new standard the amount of the charge will be calculated by subtracting the reporting unit’s
fair value from its carrying amount. Under the current standard, if we are required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, Step 2 requires us to calculate
the implied value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a
business combination and the amount of the charge is calculated by subtracting the reporting unit’s implied fair value of goodwill from its actual goodwill
balance. The standard should be applied prospectively from the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating when we will adopt the ASU and the expected
impact to related disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which increases transparency and comparability among organizations by
requiring the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements for both
lessees and lessors. The ASU is effective January 1, 2019 for public companies, with early adoption permitted. The ASU will be applied using a modified
retrospective approach to the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating when we will adopt the ASU
and the expected impact to our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting, which changed the accounting for certain aspects of employee share-based payments. The ASU requires companies to recognize
additional tax benefits or expenses related to the vesting or settlement of employee share-based awards (the difference between the actual tax benefit and the
tax benefit initially recognized for financial reporting purposes) as income tax benefit or expense in earnings, rather than in additional paid-in capital, in the
reporting period in which they occur. The ASU also requires companies to classify cash flows resulting from employee share-based payments, including the
additional tax benefits or expenses related to the vesting or settlement of share-based awards, as cash flows from operating activities rather than financing
activities. Although this change will reduce some of the administrative complexities of tracking share-based awards, it will increase the volatility of our
income tax expense and cash flows from operations. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early
adoption permitted. We early adopted the ASU during the second quarter of 2016 and are therefore required to report the impacts as though the ASU had been
adopted on January 1, 2016. Accordingly, we recognized additional income tax
 
74
Table of Contents
benefits as an increase to earnings of $152 million ($0.50 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, we recognized additional
income tax benefits as an increase to operating cash flows of $152 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The new accounting standard did not
impact any periods prior to January 1, 2016, as we applied the changes in the ASU on a prospective basis.
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), which simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to
preliminary amounts recognized in a business combination by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. Instead,
adjustments will be recognized in the period in which the adjustments are determined, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been
recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2016 and are prospectively
applying the ASU to business combination adjustments identified after the date of adoption.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes and
requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheets. We
applied the provisions of the ASU retrospectively and reclassified approximately $1.6 billion from current to noncurrent assets and approximately
$140 million from current to noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.
Note 2 – Earnings Per Share
The weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute earnings per common share were as follows (in millions):
 
   2016  2015     2014       
Weighted average common shares outstanding for basic computations   299.3    310.3       316.8        
Weighted average dilutive effect of equity awards   3.8    4.4       5.6        
Weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations   303.1    314.7       322.4        
We compute basic and diluted earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the respective weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the periods presented. Our calculation of diluted earnings per common share also includes the dilutive effects for the assumed vesting of
outstanding restricted stock units and exercise of outstanding stock options based on the treasury stock method.
There were no anti-dilutive equity awards for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions
Acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation
On November 6, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and certain affiliated companies (collectively “Sikorsky”) from
United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and certain of UTC’s subsidiaries. The purchase price of the acquisition was $9.0 billion, net of cash acquired. As a
result of the acquisition, Sikorsky became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. Sikorsky is a global company primarily engaged in the research, design,
development, manufacture and support of military and commercial helicopters. Sikorsky’s products include military helicopters such as the Black Hawk,
Seahawk, CH-53K, H-92; and commercial helicopters such as the S-76 and S-92. The acquisition enables us to extend our core business into the military and
commercial rotary wing markets, allowing us to strengthen our position in the aerospace and defense industry. Further, this acquisition will expand our
presence in commercial and international markets. Sikorsky has been aligned under our RMS business segment.
To fund the $9.0 billion acquisition price, we utilized $6.0 billion of proceeds borrowed under a temporary 364-day revolving credit facility (the 364-day
Facility), $2.0 billion of cash on hand and $1.0 billion from the issuance of commercial paper. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we repaid all outstanding
borrowings under the 364-day Facility with the proceeds from the issuance of $7.0 billion of fixed interest-rate long-term notes in a public offering (the
November 2015 Notes). In the fourth quarter of 2015, we also repaid the $1.0 billion in commercial paper borrowings (see “Note 10 – Debt”).

Table of Contents
Allocation of Purchase Price to Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
We accounted for the acquisition of Sikorsky as a business combination, which requires us to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair
value. The amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we
completed our appraisals and determined the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon acquisition of Sikorsky. As a result of the
completed valuation the significant adjustments to the carrying amounts were as follows: Goodwill, trademarks intangible assets and customer programs
intangible assets increased by about $78 million, $71 million and $57 million and inventories, net was decreased by about $185 million. The measurement
period adjustments did not result in a significant adjustment to amortization expense for intangible assets during 2016.
The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, including the refinements described
in the previous paragraph (in millions):
 
Cash and cash equivalents    $      75       
Receivables, net    1,924       
Inventories, net    1,632       
Other current assets    46       
Property, plant and equipment    649       
Goodwill    2,842       
Intangible assets:   
Customer programs    3,184       
Trademarks    887       
Other noncurrent assets    572       
Deferred income taxes, noncurrent    256       
Total identifiable assets and goodwill    12,067       
Accounts payable    (565)      
Customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred    (1,197)      
Salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes    (105)      
Other current liabilities    (430)      
Customer contractual obligations (a)    (507)      
Other noncurrent liabilities    (185)      
Total liabilities assumed    (2,989)      
Total consideration    $ 9,078       
 
(a)Recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
Intangible assets related to customer programs were recognized for each major helicopter and aftermarket program and represent the aggregate value
associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and tradenames underlying the associated program. These intangible assets will be
amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average useful life of approximately 15 years. The useful life is based on a period of expected cash flows
used to measure the fair value of each of intangible assets.
Customer contractual obligations represent liabilities on certain development programs where the expected costs exceed the expected sales under
contract. We measured these liabilities based on the price to transfer the obligation to a market participant at the measurement date, assuming that the liability
will remain outstanding in the marketplace. Based on the estimated net cash outflows of the developmental programs plus a reasonable contracting profit
margin required to transfer the contracts to market participants, we recorded assumed liabilities of $507 million. These liabilities will be liquidated in
accordance with the underlying economic pattern of the contractual obligations, as reflected by the estimated future net cash outflows incurred on the
associated contracts. From the acquisition date through the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized approximately $130 million in sales related to
customer contractual obligations. Estimated liquidation of the customer contractual obligation is approximated as follows: $110 million in 2017, $70 million
in 2018, $70 million in 2019, $60 million in 2020, $40 million in 2021 and $27 million thereafter.
The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using income, market and cost valuation methodologies. The fair value
measurements were estimated using significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurement. The income approach was primarily used to value the customer programs and
trademarks intangible assets.
 
76
Table of Contents
The income approach indicates value for an asset or liability based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated over the remaining economic
life of the asset or liability being measured. Both the amount and the duration of the cash flows are considered from a market participant perspective. Our
estimates of market participant net cash flows considered historical and projected pricing, remaining developmental effort, operational performance including
company-specific synergies, aftermarket retention, product life cycles, material and labor pricing, and other relevant customer, contractual and market factors.
Where appropriate, the net cash flows are adjusted to reflect the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net
cash flows utilized in the valuation. The adjusted future cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Projected cash
flow is discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. The market approach is a
valuation technique that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities, or a
group of assets and liabilities. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables. The
cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, was used, as
appropriate, for property, plant and equipment. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost, less an allowance for
loss in value due to depreciation.
The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of $2.8 billion of goodwill, all of which is expected to be amortizable for tax purposes.
Substantially all of the goodwill was assigned to our RMS business. The goodwill recognized is attributable to expected revenue synergies generated by the
integration of our products and technologies with those of Sikorsky, costs synergies resulting from the consolidation or elimination of certain functions, and
intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as the assembled workforce of Sikorsky.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of
expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on our best estimate of future
sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, customer budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders,
contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. Use of different estimates
and judgments could yield different results.
Impact to 2015 Financial Results
Sikorsky’s 2015 financial results have been included in our consolidated financial results only for the period from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date
through December 31, 2015. As a result, our consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of Sikorsky’s
results. From the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through December 31, 2015, Sikorsky generated net sales of approximately $400 million and operating
loss of approximately $45 million, inclusive of intangible amortization and adjustments required to account for the acquisition.
We incurred approximately $38 million of non-recoverable transaction costs associated with the Sikorsky acquisition in 2015 that were expensed as
incurred. These costs are included in other income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. We also incurred approximately $48 million in costs
associated with issuing the $7.0 billion November 2015 Notes used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 364-day Facility used to finance the
acquisition. The financing costs were recorded as a reduction of debt and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt.
Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information (unaudited)
The following table presents summarized unaudited pro forma financial information as if Sikorsky had been included in our financial results for the
entire years in 2015 and 2014 (in millions):
 
    2015   2014     
Net sales   $ 45,366    $ 47,369      
Net earnings    3,534     3,475      
Basic earnings per common share    11.39     10.97      
Diluted earnings per common share    11.23     10.78      
The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial data above has been calculated after applying our accounting policies and adjusting the historical results
of Sikorsky with pro forma adjustments, net of tax, that assume the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2014. Significant pro forma adjustments include the
recognition of additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets and additional interest expense related to the short-term debt used to
finance the acquisition. These
 
77
Table of Contents
adjustments assume the application of fair value adjustments to intangibles and the debt issuance occurred on January 1, 2014 and are approximated as
follows: amortization expense of $125 million and $150 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively; and interest expense of $40 million and $50 million in 2015
and 2014, respectively. In addition, significant nonrecurring adjustments include the elimination of a $72 million pension curtailment loss, net of tax,
recognized in 2015 and the elimination of a $58 million income tax charge related to historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries recognized by Sikorsky in 2015.
The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information also reflects an increase in interest expense, net of tax, of approximately $110 million and
approximately $120 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in interest expense is the result of assuming the November 2015 Notes were issued
on January 1, 2014. Proceeds of the November 2015 Notes were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 364-day Facility used to finance a portion
of the purchase price of Sikorsky, as contemplated at the date of acquisition.
The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information does not reflect the realization of any expected ongoing cost or revenue synergies relating to
the integration of the two companies. Further, the pro forma data should not be considered indicative of the results that would have occurred if the acquisition,
related financing and associated notes issuance and repayment of the 364-day Facility had been consummated on January 1, 2014, nor are they indicative of
future results.
AWE Management Limited
On August 24, 2016, our ownership interest in the AWE venture increased by 18% in exchange for our assuming a more significant role in managing the
operations of the venture. As a result of the increase in ownership interest, we now hold a 51% controlling interest in AWE. Accordingly, we are required to
consolidate AWE, which has been aligned under our Space Systems business segment. Space Systems’ operating results includes 100% of AWE’s net sales
and 51% of AWE’s operating profit since August 24, 2016. Previously, we accounted for our investment in AWE using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, none of AWE’s net sales and only 33% of AWE’s net earnings were included in operating profit of the Space Systems business
segment.
We accounted for this transaction as a “step acquisition” (as defined by U.S. GAAP), which requires us to consolidate and record the assets and liabilities
of AWE at fair value. Accordingly, we recorded intangible assets of $243 million related to customer relationships, $32 million of net liabilities, and
noncontrolling interests of $107 million. The intangible assets are being amortized over a period of eight years in accordance with the underlying pattern of
economic benefit reflected by the future net cash flows. In 2016, we recognized a non-cash net gain of $104 million associated with obtaining a controlling
interest in AWE, which consisted of a $127 million pretax gain recognized in the operating results of our Space Systems business segment and $23 million of
tax-related items at our corporate office. The gain represents the fair value of our 51% interest in AWE, less the carrying value of our previously held
investment in AWE and deferred taxes. The gain was recorded in other income, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of AWE
(including the intangible assets), our controlling interest, and the noncontrolling interests were determined using the income approach.
Other acquisitions
We paid $898 million in 2014 for acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates, net of cash acquired, primarily related to the acquisitions of
Zeta, Systems Made Simple and Industrial Defender. In August 2014, we completed the acquisition of all interests in Zeta, a designer of systems that enable
collection, processing, safeguarding and dissemination of information for intelligence and defense communities, which is included in our Space Systems
business segment. In connection with the acquisition of Zeta, we recorded goodwill of approximately $290 million, related to expected synergies from
combining operations and value of the existing workforce. The recorded goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Additionally, in connection with the
acquisition of Zeta, we recorded other intangible assets of approximately $100 million, primarily related to customer relationships and technologies, which
will be amortized over a weighted average period of 10 years. Also during 2014, we completed the acquisitions of interests in Systems Made Simple, a
provider of health information technology solutions, and Industrial Defender, a provider of cybersecurity solutions for control systems in the oil and gas,
utility and chemical industries. Both businesses were included in our former IS&GS business. We recorded goodwill of approximately $370 million and
intangible assets of approximately $125 million related to these acquisitions, which were reclassified to discontinued operations in connection with the
divestiture of IS&GS.

Divestiture of the Information Systems & Global Solutions Business
On August 16, 2016, we completed the previously announced divestiture of the IS&GS business, which merged with a subsidiary of Leidos, in a Reverse
Morris Trust transaction (the “Transaction”). The Transaction was completed in a multi-step process pursuant to which we initially contributed the IS&GS
business to Abacus Innovations Corporation (Abacus), a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin created to facilitate the Transaction, and the common
stock of Abacus was distributed to participating Lockheed Martin stockholders through an exchange offer. Under the terms of the exchange offer, Lockheed
Martin stockholders had the option to exchange shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of Abacus common stock. At the conclusion of the
exchange offer, all shares of Abacus common stock were exchanged for 9,369,694 shares of Lockheed Martin common stock held by Lockheed Martin
stockholders that elected to participate in the exchange. The shares of Lockheed Martin common stock that were exchanged and accepted were retired,
reducing the number of shares of our common stock outstanding by approximately 3%. Following the exchange offer, Abacus merged with a subsidiary of
Leidos, with Abacus continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leidos. As part of the merger, each share of Abacus common
stock was automatically converted into one share of Leidos common stock. We did not receive any shares of Leidos common stock as part of the Transaction
and do not hold any shares of Leidos or Abacus common stock following the Transaction. Based on an opinion of outside tax counsel, subject to customary
qualifications and based on factual representations, the exchange offer and merger will qualify as tax-free transactions to Lockheed Martin and its
stockholders, except to the extent that cash was paid to Lockheed Martin stockholders in lieu of fractional shares.
In connection with the Transaction, Abacus borrowed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.84 billion under term loan facilities with third
party financial institutions, the proceeds of which were used to make a one-time special cash payment of $1.80 billion to Lockheed Martin and to pay
associated borrowing fees and expenses. The entire special cash payment was used to repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock during the third and
fourth quarters of 2016. The obligations under the Abacus term loan facilities were guaranteed by Leidos as part of the Transaction.
As a result of the Transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.2 billion. The net gain represents the $2.5 billion fair value of the shares of
Lockheed Martin common stock exchanged and retired as part of the exchange offer, plus the $1.8 billion one-time special cash payment, less the net book
value of the IS&GS business of about $3.0 billion at August 16, 2016 and other adjustments of about $100 million. The final gain is subject to certain post-
closing adjustments, including final working capital, indemnification, and tax adjustments, which we expect to complete in 2017.
We classified the operating results of our IS&GS business as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, as the divestiture of this business represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. However, the cash flows
generated by the IS&GS business have not been reclassified in our consolidated statements of cash flows as we retained this cash as part of the Transaction.
The carrying amounts of major classes of the IS&GS business assets and liabilities that were classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations
as of December 31, 2015 are as follows (in millions):
 
Receivables, net   $807       
Inventories, net    143       
Other current assets    19       
Property, plant and equipment, net    101       
Goodwill    2,881       
Intangible assets    125       
Other noncurrent assets    54       
Total assets of the disposal group   $4,130       
Accounts payable   $(229)      
Customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred    (285)      
Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes    (209)      
Other current liabilities    (225)

Net earnings from discontinued operations   $1,549       $479       $361     
 
(a)Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflect operating results prior to the August 16, 2016 divestiture date, not the full year as shown for the prior
years.
The operating profit reflected above does not represent the IS&GS business’s historical operating profit, as the results reported within net earnings from
discontinued operations only include costs that were directly attributable to the IS&GS business and exclude certain overhead costs that were previously
allocated to the IS&GS business for each period. For instance, certain corporate overhead costs and certain defined benefit pension costs that were historically
allocated to and included in the operating results of the IS&GS business have been reclassified and included in the results of our continuing operations
because we will continue to incur these costs subsequent to the divestiture of the IS&GS business.
Certain corporate overhead costs incurred by us and previously allocated to the IS&GS business were reclassified from the IS&GS business to other
unallocated, net in our consolidated statements of earnings. These overhead costs were primarily related to expenses for senior management, legal, human
resources, finance, accounting, treasury, tax, information technology, communications, ethics and compliance, corporate employee benefits, incentives and
stock-based compensation, shared services processing and administration and depreciation for corporate fixed assets, and were not directly attributable to the
IS&GS business. We reclassified $82 million in 2016, $165 million in 2015 and $169 million in 2014 of corporate overhead costs to other unallocated, net.
Additionally, we retained all assets and obligations related to the pension benefits earned by current and former IS&GS business salaried employees through
the divestiture of the IS&GS business. As a result, the non-service portion of net pension costs (interest cost, actuarial gains and losses and expected return on
plan assets) for these plans was reclassified from the operating results of the IS&GS business and reported as a reduction to the FAS/CAS pension adjustment.
The service portion of pension costs related to IS&GS business salaried employees that transferred to Leidos continued to be included in the operating results
of the IS&GS business classified as discontinued operations because such costs will no longer be incurred by us subsequent to the divestiture of the IS&GS
business. These net pension costs were $54 million in 2016, $71 million in 2015 and $59 million in 2014.
Significant severance charges related to the IS&GS business were historically recorded at the Lockheed Martin corporate office. These charges have
been reclassified into the operating results of the IS&GS business, classified as discontinued operations, and excluded from the operating results of our
continuing operations. The amount of severance charges reclassified were $19 million in 2016 and $20 million in 2015.
Financial information related to the IS&GS business’s cash flows, such as depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, and other non-cash items,
included in our consolidated statements of cash flows was not significant.
Other Divestitures
During 2016, we completed the sale of our Lockheed Martin Commercial Flight Training (LMCFT) business, which was classified as held for sale in the
fourth quarter of 2015. Other, net in 2015 includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of approximately $90 million. This charge was partially offset by a net
deferred tax benefit of about $80 million, which is

Table of Contents
recorded in income tax expense. The net impact reduced net earnings by about $10 million. LMCFT’s financial results are not material and there was no
significant impact on our consolidated financial results as a result of completing the sale of our LMCFT business. Accordingly, LMCFT’s financial results are
not classified in discontinued operations.

programs, from nine to 20 years; customer relationships, from four to 10 years; technology, from five to seven years; trademarks, from two to five years; and
other intangibles, from three to 10 years.
Amortization expense from continuing operations for acquired finite-lived intangible assets was $284 million, $68 million and $20 million in 2016, 2015
and 2014. Estimated future amortization expense is as follows: $318 million in 2017; $298 million in 2018; $285 million in 2019; $263 million in 2020;
$256 million in 2021 and $1,786 million thereafter.
Note 5 – Information on Business Segments
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space Systems. We
organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered.
Following is a brief description of the activities of our business segments:
 
• Aeronautics – Engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft,
including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.
 
• Missiles and Fire Control – Provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire
control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy
management solutions.
 
81
Table of Contents
• Rotary and Mission Systems – Provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and civil helicopters; ship and submarine
mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems;
the Littoral Combat Ship; simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. In addition, RMS supports the needs of customers in
cybersecurity and delivers communications and command and control capability through complex mission solutions for defense applications. The 2015
results of the acquired Sikorsky business have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through
December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of Sikorsky
operations.
 
• Space Systems – Engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and
space transportation systems. Space systems provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground-based global
systems to help our customers gather, analyze and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space Systems is also responsible for various classified
systems and services in support of vital national security systems. The results of AWE have been included in our consolidated results of operations from
August 24, 2016, when we obtained controlling interest through December 31, 2016. Accordingly, the consolidated results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2016 do not reflect a full year of AWE operations. Operating profit for our Space Systems business segment also includes our share of
earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government.
The financial information in the following tables includes the results of businesses we have acquired during the past three years (see “Note 3 –
 Acquisitions and Divestitures”) from their respective dates of acquisition. The business segment operating results in the following tables exclude businesses
included in discontinued operations (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures”) for all years presented. Net sales of our business segments exclude
intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation.
Operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity
method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. United Launch Alliance (ULA), which is part of our Space Systems
business segment, is our primary equity method investee. Operating profit of our business segments excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment described
below; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as
charges related to significant severance actions (see “Note 15 – Restructuring Charges”) and goodwill impairments; gains or losses from divestitures; the
effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. These items are
included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. See “Note
1 – Significant Accounting Policies” under the caption “Use of Estimates” for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net
sales and operating profit of our business segments.
Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS),
which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and,
therefore, the CAS pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Since our consolidated financial statements must
present pension expense calculated in accordance with the financial accounting standards (FAS) requirements under GAAP, which we refer to as FAS pension
expense, the FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or decreases the CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations to equal the
FAS pension expense.

(a)FAS pension expense, CAS  pension costs and severance charges reflect the reclassification for discontinu ed operations presentation of benefits related to former IS&GS
salaried employees (see “Note 1 1 – Postretirement Plans”).
(b)The higher CAS pension cost primarily reflects the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization.

not significant are included in business segment operating profit.
(d)Other , net in 2015 includes a non-cash  asset impairm ent charge of approximately $90 millio n related to our decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT business (see “Note 3 –
Acquisitions and Divestitures”). This charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about $80 million, which is recorded in income tax expense. The net
impact reduced net earnings by about $10 million.
(e)Other , net in 2015 includes approximately $38 million of non-recoverable  transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Sikorsky .

Note 9 – Income Taxes
Our provision for federal and foreign income tax expense for continuing operations consisted of the following (in millions):
 
   2016  2015     2014        
Federal income tax expense (benefit):

Total income tax expense  $1,133   $1,173      $1,424         
State income taxes are included in our operations as general and administrative costs and, under U.S. Government regulations, are allowable costs in
establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the U.S. Government. Therefore, a substantial portion of state income taxes is included in our net
sales and cost of sales. As a result, the impact of certain transactions on our operating profit and of other matters presented in these consolidated financial
statements is disclosed net of state income taxes. Our total net state income tax expense was $112 million for 2016, $106 million for 2015, and $149 million
for 2014.
Our reconciliation of the 35% U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to actual income tax expense for continuing operations is as follows (dollars in
millions):

In 2016, we early adopted the accounting standard update for employee share-based payment awards. Accordingly, we recognized additional income tax
benefits of $152 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2016 income tax rate also benefited from the nontaxable gain recorded in connection
with the consolidation of AWE.
We recognized tax benefits of $107 million in 2016, $70 million in 2015, and $63 million in 2014 from U.S. research and development (R&D) tax
credits, including benefits attributable to prior periods. In December 2015, the R&D tax credit was permanently extended and reinstated, retroactive to the
beginning of 2015, which reduced income tax expense by approximately $70 million. In 2014, the R&D tax credit was temporarily reinstated for one year,
retroactive to the beginning of 2014, which reduced income tax expense by approximately $45 million.
We receive a tax deduction for dividends paid on shares of our common stock held by certain of our defined contribution plans with an employee stock
ownership plan feature. The amount of the tax deduction has increased as we increased our dividend over the last three years, partially offset by a decline in
the number of shares in these plans.
As a result of a decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT business (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures), we recorded an asset impairment charge of
approximately $90 million. This charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about $80 million. The net impact of the resulting tax benefit
reduced the effective income tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2015.
We participate in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process program. Examinations of the years 2015 and 2016 remain under IRS review.

Net deferred tax assets   $6,589      $6,063         
 
(a)The increase in 2016 was primarily due to the reduction in the discount rate used to measure our postretirement benefit plans (see “Note 1 1 – Postretirement Plans”).
(b)A valuation allowance was provided against certain foreign company deferred tax assets arising from carryforwards of unused tax benefits.
(c)Includes deferred taxes associated with the exchange of debt securities in prior years.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits are not material.
We and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the statute of
limitations is no longer open for U.S. Federal or non-U.S. income tax examinations for the years before 2013, other than with respect to refunds.
U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on earnings of $386 million, $310 million, and $249 million that have not been
distributed by our non-U.S. companies as of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. Our intention is to permanently reinvest these earnings, thereby indefinitely
postponing their remittance to the U.S. If these earnings had been remitted, we estimate that the additional income taxes after foreign tax credits would have
been approximately $64 million in 2016, $49 million in 2015, and $52 million in 2014.
Our federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds received, were $1.3 billion in 2016, $1.8 billion in 2015, and $1.5 billion in 2014. Our 2014
net payments reflect a $200 million refund from the IRS primarily attributable to our tax-deductible discretionary pension contributions during the fourth
quarter of 2013.

Revolving Credit Facilities
On October 9, 2015, we entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year Facility) with various banks and concurrently terminated our
existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in August 2019. The 5-year Facility was amended in October 2016 to extend its
expiration date by one year from October 9, 2020 to October 9, 2021. The 5-year Facility is available for general corporate purposes. The undrawn portion of
the 5-year Facility is also available to serve as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. We may request and the banks may grant, at their
discretion, an increase in the borrowing capacity under the 5-year Facility of up to an additional $500 million. During 2016, we borrowed and fully repaid
amounts under our commercial paper programs. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 5-year Facility as of years ended December 31, 2016 and
2015.
In contemplation of our acquisition of Sikorsky, on October 9, 2015, we also entered into a 364-day revolving credit facility (the 364-day Facility, and
together with the 5-year Facility, the Facilities) with various banks that provided $7.0 billion of funding for general corporate purposes, including the
acquisition of Sikorsky. Concurrent with the consummation of the Sikorsky acquisition, we borrowed $6.0 billion under the 364-day Facility. On
November 23, 2015, we repaid all outstanding borrowings under the 364-day Facility with proceeds received from an issuance of new debt (see below) and
terminated any remaining commitments of the lenders under the 364-day Facility.
Borrowings under the 5-year Facility bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the 5-year Facility’s
agreement. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the 5-year Facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations,
warranties, and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a
maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5-year Facility agreement. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants
contained in the 5-year Facility agreement, as well as in our debt agreements.
Long-Term Debt
In September 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities.
 
89
Table of Contents
In May 2016, we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities. We also had related
variable interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $450 million mature, which did not have a significant impact on net earnings or comprehensive income.
We made interest payments of approximately $600 million, approximately $375 million and approximately $325 million during the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
On November 23, 2015, we issued $7.0 billion of notes (the November 2015 Notes) in a registered public offering. We received net proceeds of
$6.9 billion from the offering, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, which are being amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt. The
November 2015 Notes consist of:
 
• $750 million maturing in 2018 with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% (the 2018 Notes);
• $1.25 billion maturing in 2020 with a fixed interest rate of 2.50% (the 2020 Notes);
• $500 million maturing in 2023 with a fixed interest rate of 3.10% the 2023 Notes);
• $2.0 billion maturing in 2026 with a fixed interest rate of 3.55% (the 2026 Notes);
• $500 million maturing in 2036 with a fixed interest rate of 4.50% (the 2036 Notes); and
• $2.0 billion maturing in 2046 with a fixed interest rate of 4.70% (the 2046 Notes).
We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the November 2015 Notes and unpaid interest at any time by paying the principal amount of notes being
redeemed plus any make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Interest is payable on the 2018 Notes and the 2020 Notes
on May 23 and November 23 of each year; on the 2023 Notes and the 2026 Notes on January 15 and July 15 of each year; and on the 2036 Notes and the
2046 Notes on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The November 2015 Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness. The proceeds of the November 2015 Notes were used to repay $6.0 billion of borrowings under our 364-day Facility and for
general corporate purposes.
On February 20, 2015, we issued $2.25 billion of notes (the February 2015 Notes) in a registered public offering. We received net proceeds of
$2.21 billion from the offering, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, which are being amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt. The
February 2015 Notes consist of $750 million maturing in 2025 with a fixed interest rate of 2.90%, $500 million maturing in 2035 with a fixed interest rate
of 3.60% and $1.0 billion maturing in 2045 with a fixed interest rate of 3.80%. We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the notes at any time by paying
the principal amount of notes being redeemed plus any make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Interest on the notes
is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year. These notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness. The proceeds of the February 2015 Notes were used for general corporate purposes.
Commercial Paper
We have agreements in place with financial institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. In connection with the Sikorsky acquisition, in
the fourth quarter of 2015 we borrowed and repaid approximately $1.0 billion under our commercial paper programs. There were no commercial paper
borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. If we were to issue commercial paper in the future, the borrowings would be supported by the
5-year Facility.
Note 11 – Postretirement Plans
Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans
Many of our employees are covered by qualified defined benefit pension plans and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible
retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit pension plans to provide for benefits in excess of qualified
plan limits. Non-union employees hired after December 2005 do not participate in our qualified defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in
a qualified defined contribution plan in addition to our other retirement savings plans. They also have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but
we do not subsidize the cost of their participation in those plans as we do with employees hired before January 1, 2006. Over the last few years, we have
negotiated similar changes with various labor organizations such that new union represented employees do not participate in our defined benefit pension
plans. In June 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees to freeze future retirement
benefits. The calculation of retirement benefits under the affected defined benefit pension plans is determined by a formula that takes into account the
participants’ years of credited service and average compensation. The freeze will take effect in two stages.
 
90
Table of Contents
Beginning on January 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen so that future pay increases, annual
incentive bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after December 31, 2015 are not used to calculate retirement benefits. On January 1, 2020,
the service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited
service for any period after December 31, 2019. When the freeze is complete, the majority of our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced
defined contribution retirement savings plan. As part of the November 6, 2015 acquisition of Sikorsky, we established a new defined benefit pension plan for
Sikorsky’s union workforce that provides benefits for their prospective service with us. The Sikorsky salaried employees participate in a defined contribution
plan. We did not assume any legacy pension liability from UTC.
We have made contributions to trusts established to pay future benefits to eligible retirees and dependents, including Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary
Association trusts and 401(h) accounts, the assets of which will be used to pay expenses of certain retiree medical plans. We use December 31 as the
measurement date. Benefit obligations as of the end of each year reflect assumptions in effect as of those dates. Net periodic benefit cost is based on
assumptions in effect at the end of the respective preceding year.
The rules related to accounting for postretirement benefit plans under GAAP require us to recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our
postretirement benefit plans as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. There is a corresponding non-cash adjustment to accumulated
other comprehensive loss, net of tax benefits recorded as deferred tax assets, in stockholders’ equity. The funded status is measured as the difference between
the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan.
The net periodic benefit cost recognized each year included the following (in millions):

(a)Total net periodic benefit cost associated with our qualified defined benefit plans represents pension expense calculated in accordance with GAAP (F AS pension expense).
We are requir ed to calculate pension expense in accordance with both GAAP and CAS rules, each of which results in a different calculated amount of pension expense.
The CAS pension cost is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, is recognized in net sales and cost of
sales for products and services. We include the difference between FAS pension expense and CAS pension cost, referred to as the FAS/CAS pension adjustment, as a
component of other unallocated, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. The FAS/CAS pension adjustment, which was $902 million in 2016, $400 million in
2015, and $317 million in 2014, effectively adjusts the amount of CAS pension cost in the business segment operating profit so that pension expense recorded on our
consolidated statements of earnings is equal to FAS pension expense. FAS pension expense and CAS pension costs reflect the reclassification for discontinued operations
presentation of benefits related to former IS&GS salaried employees.
(b)Net of the reclassification for discontinued operations presentation of pension benefits related to former IS&GS salaried employees ($14 million in 2016, $24 million in
2015 and $17 million in 2014).

The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all qualified defined benefit pension plans was $44.9 billion and $43.5 billion at December 31, 2016 and
2015, of which $44.8 billion and $43.4 billion related to plans where the ABO was in excess of plan assets. The ABO represents benefits accrued without
assuming future compensation increases to plan participants. Certain key information related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in millions):

We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans to provide benefits in excess of qualified plan limits. The aggregate liabilities for these plans at
December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $1.2 billion, which also represent the plans’ unfunded status. We have set aside certain assets totaling $460 million and
$421 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 in a separate trust which we expect to be used to pay obligations under our nonqualified defined benefit
plans. In accordance with GAAP, those assets may not be used to offset the amount of the benefit obligation similar to the postretirement benefit plans in the
table above. The unrecognized net actuarial losses at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $642 million and $632 million. The unrecognized prior service credit
at December 31, 2016 was $74 million and was $95 million at December 31, 2015. The expense associated with these plans totaled $125 million in 2016,
$117 million in 2015 and $115 million in 2014. We also sponsor a small number of other postemployment plans and foreign benefit plans. The aggregate
liability for the other postemployment plans was $63 million and $70 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The expense for the other postemployment
plans, as well as the liability and expense associated with the foreign benefit plans, was not material to our results of operations, financial position or cash
flows. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense associated with our nonqualified defined benefit plans and
postemployment plans are similar to those assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense related to our qualified defined benefit pension
plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans as described below.

We expect that approximately $1.2 billion, or about $800 million net of tax, of actuarial losses and net prior service credit related to postretirement
benefit plans included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the end of 2016 to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost during 2017. Of this amount,
$1.1 billion, or $743 million net of tax, relates to our qualified defined benefit plans and is included in our expected 2017 pension expense of $1.4 billion.
Actuarial Assumptions
The actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations at December 31 of each year and to determine the net periodic benefit cost for each
subsequent year, were as follows:
 
   Qualified Defined Benefit
Pension Plans           Retiree Medical and
Life Insurance Plans  
     2016        2015       2014                2016        2015       2014     
Weighted average discount rate    4.125%     4.375%     4.00%         4.00%     4.25%     3.75%  
Expected long-term rate of return on assets    7.50%     8.00%     8.00%         7.50%     8.00%     8.00%  
Rate of increase in future compensation levels (for applicable bargained pension
plans)    4.50%     4.50%     4.30%            
Health care trend rate assumed for next year              8.75%     9.00%     8.50%  
Ultimate health care trend rate              5.00%     5.00%     5.00%  
Year that the ultimate health care trend rate is reached                            2032          2032        2029      
The decrease in the discount rate from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligations of our
qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in the discount rate from December 31, 2014 to
December 31, 2015 resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $2.1 billion at
December 31, 2015.
The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the
benefits included in the benefit obligations. That assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term
allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns.
Plan Assets
Investment policies and strategies – Lockheed Martin Investment Management Company (LMIMCo), our wholly-owned subsidiary, has the fiduciary
responsibility for making investment decisions related to the assets of our postretirement benefit plans. LMIMCo’s investment objectives for the assets of
these plans are (1) to minimize the net present value of expected funding contributions; (2) to ensure there is a high probability that each plan meets or
exceeds our actuarial long-term rate of return assumptions; and (3) to diversify assets to minimize the risk of large losses. The nature and duration of benefit
obligations, along with assumptions concerning asset class returns and return correlations, are considered when determining an appropriate asset allocation to
achieve the investment objectives.
Investment policies and strategies governing the assets of the plans are designed to achieve investment objectives within prudent risk parameters. Risk
management practices include the use of external investment managers; the maintenance of a portfolio diversified by asset class, investment approach and
security holdings; and the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet benefit obligations as they come due.
LMIMCo’s investment policies require that asset allocations of postretirement benefit plans be maintained within the following approximate ranges:
 
Asset Class   Asset Allocation
Ranges
Cash and cash equivalents    0-20%
Equity   15-65%
Fixed income   10-60%
Alternative investments:   
Private equity funds    0-15%
Real estate funds    0-10%
Hedge funds    0-20%
Commodities    0-25%

Fair value measurements – The rules related to accounting for postretirement benefit plans under GAAP require certain fair value disclosures related to
postretirement benefit plan assets, even though those assets are not included on our consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents the fair value of
the assets (in millions) of our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans by asset category and their level within the
fair value hierarchy, which has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair
values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. Certain other investments are measured at fair value using their Net Asset Value (NAV) per share and
do not have readily determined values and are thus not subject to leveling in the fair value hierarchy. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the
number of shares outstanding.

Valuation techniques – Cash equivalents are mostly comprised of short-term money-market instruments and are valued at cost, which approximates fair
value.
U.S. equity securities and international equity securities categorized as Level 1 are traded on active national and international exchanges and are valued
at their closing prices on the last trading day of the year. For U.S. equity securities and international equity securities not traded on an active exchange, or if
the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized
as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor or categorized as Level 3 if the custodian obtains uncorroborated quotes from a
broker or investment manager.
Commingled equity funds categorized as Level 1 are traded on active national and international exchanges and are valued at their closing prices on the
last trading day of the year. For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains
indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated
quotes from a pricing vendor.
Fixed income investments categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest
rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with
similar characteristics. Fixed income investments are categorized at Level 3 when valuations using observable inputs are unavailable. The trustee obtains
pricing based on indicative quotes or bid evaluations from vendors, brokers or the investment manager.
Commodities are traded on an active commodity exchange and are valued at their closing prices on the last trading day of the year.
Certain commingled equity funds, consisting of equity mutual funds, are valued using the NAV. The NAV valuations are based on the underlying
investments and typically redeemable within 90 days.
Private Equity funds consist of partnership and co-investment funds. The NAV is based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes
unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have redemption periods between eight and 12
years.
Real Estate funds consist of partnerships, most of which are closed-end funds, for which the NAV is based on valuation models and periodic appraisals.
These funds typically have redemption periods between eight and 10 years.
Hedge Funds consist of direct hedge funds for which the NAV is generally based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge
funds are based on the specific terms of each fund, and generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.

Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments
The funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended by the PPA, and in a manner consistent
with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. There were no contributions to our legacy qualified defined benefit pension plans during 2016. We do not plan to
make contributions to our legacy pension plans in 2017 because none are required using current assumptions including investment returns on plan assets. We
made $23 million in contributions during 2016 to our newly established Sikorsky pension plan and expect to make $45 million in contributions to this plan
during 2017.
The following table presents estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future employee service, as of December 31, 2016 (in millions):

Qualified defined benefit pension plans   $2,260     $2,340     $2,420     $2,510     $2,590      $13,920   
Retiree medical and life insurance plans    180      180      190      190      190      870   
Defined Contribution Plans
We maintain a number of defined contribution plans, most with 401(k) features, that cover substantially all of our employees. Under the provisions of our
401(k) plans, we match most employees’ eligible contributions at rates specified in the plan documents. Our contributions were $617 million in 2016,
$393 million in 2015 and $385 million in 2014, the majority of which were funded in our common stock. Our defined contribution plans held approximately
36.9 million and 40.0 million shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Note 12 – Stockholders’ Equity
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our authorized capital was composed of 1.5 billion shares of common stock and 50 million shares of series preferred
stock. Of the 290 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2016, 289 million shares were considered outstanding for
consolidated balance sheet presentation purposes; the remaining shares were held in a separate trust. Of the 305 million shares of common stock issued and
outstanding as of December 31, 2015, 303 million shares were considered outstanding for consolidated balance sheet presentation purposes; the remaining
shares were held in a separate trust. No shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2016 or 2015.
Repurchases of Common Stock
During 2016, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of our common stock for $2.1 billion. During 2015 and 2014, we paid $3.1 billion and $1.9 billion to
repurchase 15.2 million and 11.5 million shares of our common stock.
On September 22, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $2.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total
remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2016. As we repurchase our common
shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of
additional paid-in capital. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with
the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $1.7 billion and $2.4 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in 2016 and 2015.
We paid dividends totaling $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share) in 2016, $1.9 billion ($6.15 per share) in 2015 and $1.8 billion ($5.49 per share) in 2014. We
have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years, including a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter of 2016.
We declared quarterly dividends of $1.65 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and $1.82 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016; $1.50
per share during each of the first three quarters of 2015 and $1.65 per share during the fourth quarter of 2015; and $1.33 per share during each of the first
three quarters of 2014 and $1.50 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014.

benefits include amounts recognized on our income tax returns as current deductions and deferred incom e taxes, which will be recognized on our tax returns in future
years. See “Note 9 – Income T axes” and “Note 1 1 –Postretirement Plans” for more information on our income taxes and postretirement benefit plans.
(b) Associated with the divesture of the IS&GS business and included in net gain on divestiture of discontinued operations.
Note 13 – Stock-Based Compensation
During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded non-cash stock-based compensation expense totaling $149 million, $133 million and $154 million, which is
included as a component of other unallocated, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. The net impact to earnings for the respective years was
$97 million, $86 million and $100 million.
As of December 31, 2016, we had $83 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards, which is expected to be recognized over
a weighted average period of 1.8 years. We received cash from the exercise of stock options totaling $106 million, $174 million and $308 million during
2016, 2015 and 2014. In addition, our income tax liabilities for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were reduced by $219 million, $213 million and $215 million due to
recognized tax benefits on stock-based compensation arrangements.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
Under plans approved by our stockholders, we are authorized to grant key employees stock-based incentive awards, including options to purchase
common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs) or other stock units. The exercise price of options to
purchase common stock may not be less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. No award of stock options may become fully vested prior
to the third anniversary of the grant and no portion of a stock option grant may become vested in less than one year. The minimum
 
98
Table of Contents
vesting period for restricted stock or stock units payable in stock is three years. Award agreements may provide for shorter or pro-rated vesting periods or
vesting following termination of employment in the case of death, disability, divestiture, retirement, change of control or layoff. The maximum term of a
stock option or any other award is 10 years.
At December 31, 2016, inclusive of the shares reserved for outstanding stock options, RSUs and PSUs, we had approximately 12 million shares reserved
for issuance under the plans. At December 31, 2016, approximately six million of the shares reserved for issuance remained available for grant under our
stock-based compensation plans. We issue new shares upon the exercise of stock options or when restrictions on RSUs and PSUs have been satisfied.

Nonvested at December 31, 2016    788        $  183.00          
In 2016, we granted certain employees approximately 0.7 million restricted stock units (RSUs) with a grant-date fair value of $206.69 per RSU. The
grant-date fair value of these RSUs is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date less a discount to reflect the delay in payment
of dividend-equivalent cash payments that are made only upon vesting, which is generally three years from the grant date. We recognize the grant-date fair
value of RSUs, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is shorter than the vesting period if the
employee is retirement eligible on the date of grant or will become retirement eligible before the end of the vesting period.
Stock Options
We generally recognize compensation cost for stock options ratably over the three-year vesting period. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were
3.0 million (weighted average exercise price of $85.82) and 4.2 million (weighted average exercise price of $86.61) stock options outstanding. All of the
stock options outstanding are vested as of December 31, 2016 and have a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately three years and an
aggregate intrinsic value of $491 million. There were 1.2 million (weighted average exercise price of $88.61) stock options exercised during 2016. We did not
grant stock options to employees during 2016 and 2015.
The following table pertains to stock options granted through 2012, in addition to stock options that vested and were exercised in 2016, 2015 and 2014
(in millions):
 
   2016  2015  2014

Intrinsic value of all stock options exercised   172    265    297        
In 2012, we estimated the fair value for stock options at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which required us to make
certain assumptions. We used the following weighted average assumptions in the model: risk-free interest rate of 0.78%, dividend yield of 5.40%, a five year
historical volatility factor of 0.28 and an expected option life of five years.

PSUs
In 2016, we granted certain employees PSUs with an aggregate target award of approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock. The PSUs vest
three years from the grant date based on continuous service, with the number of shares earned (0% to 200% of the target award) depending upon the extent to
which we achieve certain financial and market performance targets measured over the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018. About half of
the PSUs were valued at $206.37 per PSU in a manner similar to RSUs mentioned above as the financial targets are based on our operating results. We
recognize the grant-date fair value of these PSUs, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period based on the number of
awards expected to vest at each reporting date. The remaining PSUs were valued at $212.37 per PSU using a Monte Carlo model as the performance target is
related to our total shareholder return relative to our peer group. We recognize the grant-date fair value of these awards, less estimated forfeitures, as
compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies
We are a party to or have property subject to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising
under provisions relating to the protection of the environment and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned. These types
of matters could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the
outcome of each of these matters, including the legal proceedings described below, will have a material adverse effect on the Corporation as a whole,
notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our net earnings in any particular interim reporting period.
Among the factors that we consider in this assessment are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss
contingency (if estimable), the progress of the case, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in
similar cases and the experience of other companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond to the proceeding or
claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress.
Although we cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty, where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have
been incurred, GAAP requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make a statement that such an estimate cannot be
made. We follow a thorough process in which we seek to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, and only if we are unable to make such an
estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate cannot be made. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceedings,
a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.
Legal Proceedings
As a result of our acquisition of Sikorsky, we assumed the defense of and any potential liability for the following civil False Claims Act lawsuit. In
October 2014, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin alleging that Sikorsky and two of its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, Derco Aerospace (Derco) and Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. (SSSI), violated the civil False Claims Act in connection with a
contract that the U.S. Navy awarded to SSSI in June 2006 to support the Navy’s T-34 and T-44 fixed-wing turboprop training aircraft. SSSI subcontracted
with Derco primarily to procure and manage the spare parts for the training aircraft. The Government alleges that SSSI overbilled the Navy on the contract
because Derco added profit and overhead costs to the price of the spare parts that Derco procured and then sold to SSSI. The Government also claims that
SSSI submitted false Certificates of Final Indirect Costs in the years 2006 through 2012.
The Government’s complaint asserts numerous claims for violations of the False Claims Act, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. The Government
seeks damages in excess of $45 million, subject to trebling, plus statutory penalties. We believe that we have legal and factual defenses to the government’s
claims. Although we continue to evaluate our liability and exposure, we do not currently believe that it is probable that we will incur a material loss. If,
contrary to our expectations, the Government prevails in this matter and proves damages at the high end of the range sought and is successful in having these
trebled, the outcome could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability is recognized and on our cash flows for the
period in which any damages are paid.
On April 24, 2009, we filed a declaratory judgment action against the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its Capital Construction
Company (collectively, the MTA) asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to find that the MTA is in material breach of our
agreement based on the MTA’s failure to provide access to sites where work must be performed and the customer-furnished equipment necessary to complete
the contract. The MTA filed an
 
100
Table of Contents
answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default. The primary damages sought by
the MTA are the cost to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. While we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete
the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of $323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us,
and that the MTA is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. We dispute the MTA’s allegations and are defending against them. Additionally,
following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were represented by independent counsel, concluded that the MTA’s
termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later amended to include claims for monetary damages against the
MTA of approximately $95 million. This matter was taken under submission by the District Court in December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the
filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties. At this time we are awaiting a decision from the District Court. Although this matter relates to the IS&GS
business, we retained it when IS&GS was divested.
Environmental Matters
We are involved in environmental proceedings and potential proceedings relating to soil and groundwater contamination, disposal of hazardous waste
and other environmental matters at several of our current or former facilities or at third-party sites where we have been designated as a potentially responsible
party (PRP). A substantial portion of environmental costs will be included in our net sales and cost of sales in future periods pursuant to U.S. Government
regulations. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record a receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable
through the pricing of products and services to agencies of the U.S. Government, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We
continuously evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S.
Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and recent efforts by some U.S. Government
representatives to limit such reimbursement. We include the portion of those environmental costs expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government
contracts, or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts, in our cost of sales at the time the liability is established.
At each of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the aggregate amount of liabilities recorded relative to environmental matters was $1.0 billion, most of which
are recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We have recorded receivables totaling $870 million and $858 million at
December 31, 2016 and 2015, most of which are recorded in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets, for the estimated future recovery of
these costs, as we consider the recovery probable based on the factors previously mentioned. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20
years.
Environmental cleanup activities usually span several years, which makes estimating liabilities a matter of judgment because of uncertainties with
respect to assessing the extent of the contamination as well as such factors as changing remediation technologies and continually evolving regulatory
environmental standards. There are a number of former operating facilities that we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. We
perform quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites and the related liabilities and receivables. Additionally, in our quarterly reviews
we consider these and other factors in estimating the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities and record a
liability when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the
costs to be incurred for remediation at a particular site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not
fixed or cannot be reliably determined. We reasonably cannot determine the extent of our financial exposure in all cases as, although a loss may be probable
or reasonably possible, in some cases it is not possible at this time to estimate the loss or reasonably possible loss or range of loss.
We also are pursuing claims for recovery of costs incurred or contribution to site cleanup costs against other PRPs, including the U.S. Government, and
are conducting remediation activities under various consent decrees and orders relating to soil, groundwater, sediment or surface water contamination at
certain sites of former or current operations. Under an agreement related to our Burbank and Glendale, California, sites, the U.S. Government reimburses us
an amount equal to approximately 50% of expenditures for certain remediation activities in its capacity as a PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).
The current standard in California for the maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water is 10 parts per billion (ppb). This
standard is being challenged by the California Manufacturers and Technology Association (CMTA) as being lower than is required to protect public health. If
the standard remains at 10 ppb, it will not have a material impact on our existing remediation costs in California. The U.S. EPA is considering whether to
regulate hexavalent chromium.
 
101
Table of Contents
In addition, California is reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.
EPA) is taking steps to regulate perchlorate in drinking water. If substantially lower standards are adopted, in either California or at the federal level for
perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium, we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of
the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be
allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may
have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.
Operating Leases
We rent certain equipment and facilities under operating leases. Certain major plant facilities and equipment are furnished by the Government under
short-term or cancelable arrangements. Our total rental expense under operating leases was $202 million, $195 million and $197 million for 2016, 2015 and
2014. Future minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2016 for long-term non-cancelable operating leases were $762 million ($179 million in 2017,
$150 million in 2018, $131 million in 2019, $103 million in 2020, $78 million in 2021 and $121 million in later years).
Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Third-Party Guarantees
We have entered into standby letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees with financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating
to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available
for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as venture partners. We had
total outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees aggregating $3.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and $3.8 billion at December 31,
2015.
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, third-party guarantees totaled $709 million and $678 million, of which approximately 56% and 79% related to
guarantees of contractual performance of ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum
amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the venture partners. In addition, we generally have cross-indemnities in place that
may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a venture partner. We believe our current and former venture partners will be able to perform
their obligations, as they have done through December 31, 2016, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the guarantees. In determining our
exposures, we evaluate the reputation, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former venture partners. There were no material amounts
recorded in our consolidated financial statements related to third-party guarantees.
United Launch Alliance
In connection with our 50% ownership interest of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) are required to provide ULA an additional capital
contribution if ULA is unable to make required payments under its inventory supply agreement with Boeing. As of December 31, 2016, ULA’s total
remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agreement was $120 million. The parties have agreed to defer the remaining payment obligation,
as it is more than offset by other commitments to ULA. Accordingly, we do not expect to be required to make a capital contribution to ULA under this
agreement.
In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other for guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA
under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2016, and that it
will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities or guarantees.
Our 50% ownership share of ULA’s net assets initially exceeded the book value of our investment by approximately $395 million (of which
approximately $40 million remaining was amortized during 2016). This yearly amortization and our share of ULA’s net earnings are reported as equity in net
earnings (losses) of equity investees in other income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. Our investment in ULA totaled $788 million and
$748 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Note 15 – Restructuring Charges
2016 Actions
During 2016, we recorded severance charges totaling approximately $80 million related to our Aeronautics business segment. The charges consisted of
severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated
employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several
quarters. During 2016, we paid $70 million in severance payments associated with these actions.
2015 Actions
During 2015, we recorded severance charges totaling $82 million, of which $67 million related to our RMS business segment and $15 million related to
businesses that were reported in our former IS&GS business prior to our fourth quarter 2015 program realignment. The charges consisted of severance costs
associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated employees receive
lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several quarters. During 2016,
we paid $64 million in severance payments associated with these actions.
In connection with the Sikorsky acquisition, we assumed obligations related to certain restructuring actions committed to by Sikorsky in June 2015. Net
of amounts we anticipate to recover through the pricing of our products and services to our customers, we incurred and paid $40 million of costs in 2016
related to these actions.
We expect to recover a substantial amount of the restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other
customers in future periods, with the impact included in the respective business segment’s results of operations.
Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (in millions):
 
  December 31, 2016      December 31, 2015  
   Total   Level 1   Level 2     Total   Level 1   Level 2

Equity securities  $79     $  79     $  —      $89     $  89     $  —      
Mutual funds   856     856     —       745     745     —      
U.S. Government securities   113     —     113       119     —     119      
Other securities   151     —     151       147     —     147      
Derivatives   27     —     27       15     —     15      
Liabilities              
Derivatives   85     —     85       35     —     35      
Substantially all assets measured at fair value, other than derivatives, represent investments classified as trading securities held in a separate trust to fund
certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and are recorded in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of
equity securities and mutual funds are determined by reference to the quoted market price per unit in active markets multiplied by the number of units held
without consideration of transaction costs. The fair values of U.S. Government and other securities are determined using pricing models that use observable
inputs (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with
similar characteristics. The fair values of derivative instruments, which consist of foreign currency exchange forward and interest rate swap contracts,
primarily are determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable inputs such as interest rates,
credit spreads and foreign currency exchange rates. We did not have any transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy during
2016.
In addition to the financial instruments listed in the table above, we hold other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables,
accounts payable and debt. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximated their fair values. The
estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $16.2 billion and $16.6 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the outstanding principal amount was
$15.3 billion and $16.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, excluding $1.0 billion of unamortized discounts and issuance costs at the end of each of those
years. The estimated fair values of our outstanding debt were determined based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets (Level 2).

In connection with the Sikorsky acquisition, we recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. See “Note 3 – Acquisitions and
Divestitures” for further information about the fair values assigned and amounts subject to adjustment.

(a) Net sales and operating profit vary from the amounts previously reported on Form 10-Q  as a result of our former IS&GS business being classified as discontinued
operations in the third quarter of 2016, which is reflected for all periods presented.
(b) The first quarter of 2016 varies from the amounts previously reported on Form 10-Q  as a result of adopting ASU No. 2016-09  (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting
Policies”).
(c) The third quarter of 2016 includes a net gain of $1.2 billion related to the divestiture of our former IS&GS business.
(d) The third quarter of 2016 includes the results of AWE from August 26, 2016, the date we obtained controlling interest, including approximately $103 million in net sales
and $104 million in net earnings. Third quarter net earnings includes a non-cash  gain on the step acquisitio n of AWE (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures”). The
fourth quarter of 2016 includes the results of A WE for the entire quarter , including approximately $307 million in net sales and $2.9 million in net earnings.
(e) The fourth quarter of 2015 includes the results of Sikorsky since the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through December 31, 2015, including approximately
$400 million in net sales and about $45 million in operating loss, inclusive of intangible amortization and adjustments required to account for the acquisition.
(f) The sum of the quarterly earnings per share amounts do not equal the earnings per share amounts included on our consolidated statements of earnings, primarily due to the
timing of our share repurchases during each respective year .
(g) The third and fourth quarters of 2015 include charges for workforce reductions of $15 million and $67 million ($10 million and $44 million after tax). The fourth quarter
of 2015 includes a tax benefit of about $71 million due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2015.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016. The evaluation was performed with
the participation of senior management of each business segment and key Corporate functions, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due
to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting at Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation which we acquired on November 6, 2015 and which
operates as a business unit of our Rotary and Mission Systems business segment.
Notwithstanding the identified material weakness, management, including our CEO (principal executive officer) and CFO (principal financial officer),
believes the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is
designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
consolidated financial statements for external purposes.
Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. This assessment
was based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
(2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that a material weakness exists in our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2016. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements could occur but will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis.
Sikorsky was acquired on November 6, 2015 and generated about 10% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Prior to 2016,
Sikorsky was not included in assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) rules provide companies one year to assess controls at an acquired entity. Accordingly, within this period, we performed our first comprehensive
assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls at Sikorsky and determined that Sikorsky’s internal control over financial reporting was
ineffective as of December 31, 2016. Specifically, Sikorsky did not adequately identify, design and implement appropriate process-level controls for its
processes and appropriate information technology controls for its information technology systems, including Sikorsky’s contract accounting / sales
recognition processes, inventory accounting process and payroll process. There were no material errors in the financial results or balances identified as a
result of the control deficiencies, and there was no restatement of prior period financial statements and no change in previously released financial results were
required as the result of these control deficiencies.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report expressing an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting, which is below.
Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weakness
Management has and will continue to enhance the risk assessment process and design of internal control over financial reporting at Sikorsky. This
includes initiation of compensating controls and enhanced and revised design of existing financial reporting controls, information technology applications and
procedures at Sikorsky. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time
and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be
completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2017.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Other than with respect to the remediation efforts described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most
recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP,
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,
Regarding Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Lockheed Martin Corporation
We have audited Lockheed Martin Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO
criteria). Lockheed Martin Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following
material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management identified a material weakness in the design and operation of
internal controls, including information technology controls, within Sikorsky’s processes (including the contract accounting / sales recognition processes,
inventory accounting process, and payroll process). We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Lockheed Martin Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated
statement of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. This material
weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2016 financial statements, and this report does
not affect our report dated February 9, 2017, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Lockheed
Martin Corporation has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.

(1)Column (a) includes, as of December 31, 2016: 1,747,151 shares that have been granted as Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), 936,308 shares that could be earned pursuant
to grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) (assuming the maximum number of PSUs are earned and payable at the end of the three-year performance period) and
2,967,046 shares granted as options under the Lockheed Martin Corporation 2011 Incentive Performan ce Award Plan (2011 IPA Plan) or predecessor plans prior to
January 1, 2013 and 23,346 shares granted as options and 128,822 stock units payable in stock or cash under the Lockheed Martin Corporation 2009 Directors Equity
Plan (Directors Equity Plan) or predecessor plans for members (or former members) of the Board of Directors. Column (c) includes, as of December 31, 2016, 5,751,655
shares availab le for future issuance under the 2011 IPA Plan as options, stock appreciation rights (SARs ), restricted stock awards (RSAs), RSUs or PSUs and 464,816
shares available for future issuance under the Directo rs Equity Plan as stock options and stock units. Of the 5,751,655 shares available for grant under the 2011 IPA Plan
on December 31, 2016, 516,653 and 236,654 shares are issuable pursuant to grants made on January 26, 2017, of RSUs and PSUs (assuming the maximum number of
PSUs are earned and payable at the end of the three-year performance period), respectively . The weighted average price does not take into account shares issued pursuant
to RSUs or PSUs.
(2)The shares represent annu al incentive bonuses and Long-T erm Incentive Performance (LTIP) payments  earned and voluntarily deferred by employees. The deferred
amounts are payable under the Deferred Management Incentive Compensation Plan (DMICP). Deferred amounts are credited as phantom stock units at the closing price
of our stock on the date the deferral is effective. Amounts equal to our dividend are credited as stock units at the time we pay a dividend. Following termination of
employment, a number of shares of stock equal to the number of stock units credited to the employee’ s DMICP account are distributed to the employee. There is no
discount or value transfer on the stock distributed. Distributions may be made from newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market. Historically , all
distributions have come from shares held in a separate trust and, therefore, do not further dilute our comm on shares outstanding. As a result, these shares also were not
considered in calculating the total weighted average exercise price in the table. Because the DMICP shares are outstanding, they should be included in the denominator
(and not the numerator) of a dilution calculation.

Amendment
Merger of Plans
December 31, 2016
Lockheed Martin Corporation (Corporation) wishes to merge certain non-qualified supplemental defined benefit pension plans sponsored by the Corporation
into a single plan, to be referred to as the Lockheed Martin Corporation Consolidated Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan. Accordingly, pursuant to the
authority granted to the Senior Vice President, Human Resources of the Corporation:
 
 1. Effective December 31, 2016, the following plans (Component Plans) shall be merged into and with each other into the Lockheed Martin
Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan, which shall be the surviving plan, and which thereafter shall be known as the Lockheed Martin
Corporation Consolidated Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan:
 
 a. Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan
 
 b. Lockheed Martin Supplementary Pension Plan For Transferred Employees of GE Operations
 
 c. Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan For Certain Transferred Employees Of Lockheed Martin Corporation
 
 2. The merger contemplated by paragraph (1) above shall not change the benefits, rights, features or other substantive terms of any of the
Component Plans, including any annexes and appendices to such Component Plans. The benefits, rights, features and other substantive terms of
each Component Plan shall continue to be those described
 
1
 in the document governing that Component Plan, each of which is attached to this Amendment as a separate part as follows:
 
 •  Part A: Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan (Effective July 1, 2015)
 
 •  Part B: Lockheed Martin Supplementary Pension Plan For Transferred Employees of GE Operations (Restated Through July 1, 2014)
 
 •  Part C: Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan For Certain Transferred Employees Of Lockheed Martin Corporation (Restated Through

For the avoidance of doubt, all provisions of a Component Plan that govern any portion of a participant’s benefit that accrued and vested under
the Component Plan on or before December 31, 2004 remains unchanged as a result of this Amendment.
 
 3. Neither the merger contemplated by paragraph (1) above nor the restatement of any plan to reflect the merger shall cause any participant to
receive duplicate credit for the same period of service or to receive duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of time.

LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION
SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN
(Effective July 1, 2015)
EXECUTION COPY
ARTICLE I
PURPOSES OF THE PLAN
The purposes of the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) are:
 
 (a)to provide certain employees of Lockheed Martin Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) with those benefits that cannot be paid from
the Company’s tax-qualified plans because of the limitations on contributions and benefits contained in Internal Revenue Code section 415;
 
 (b)to provide certain key management employees of the Company with those benefits that cannot be paid from the Company’s tax-qualified plans
because of other limitations on contributions and benefits contained in the Internal Revenue Code, such as the limitations contained in Code
section 401(a)(17); and
 
 (c)to provide certain key management employees of the Company with other supplemental benefits.
The following plans and predecessor plans were amended, restated and merged to form a single Plan, effective July 1, 2004:
 
 1. Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan of Lockheed Martin Corporation (formerly the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan of Lockheed
Corporation)
 
 2. Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan (formerly the Martin Marietta Corporation Supplemental Excess Retirement
Plan)
 
 3. Lockheed Martin Supplemental Retirement Income Plan (formerly the Martin Marietta Supplemental Retirement Income Plan)
 
 4. Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (formerly the Loral Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan).
The Plan was amended and restated, effective January 1, 2005, in order to comply with the requirements of Code section 409A. The 2005 amendment
and restatement of the Plan, as further amended and restated from time to time, shall apply only to the portion of a Participant’s benefit that accrued and
vested on or after January 1, 2005. The portion of a Participant’s benefit that accrued and vested prior to January 1, 2005 shall be governed by the terms of the
Plan in effect on December 31, 2004, attached as Appendix B. The Plan was amended and restated, effective June 26, 2008, in order to clarify certain
provisions in accordance with the final Treasury Regulations issued under Code section 409A and to make other clarifications with respect to eligibility and
benefits. The Plan was amended and restated effective December 31, 2008 to order to make further clarifications in accordance with the final Treasury
Regulations issued under Code section 409A and to make other administrative clarifications.

EXECUTION COPY
On June 26, 2014, the Qualified Pension Plan was amended: (i) to provide that pensionable earnings under the Qualified Pension Plan shall not include
amounts earned for or relating to any period after December 31, 2015; and (2) to freeze credited service under the Qualified Pension Plan effective January 1,
2020 and to provide that no Qualified Pension Plan participant shall accrue credited service with respect to any period after December 31, 2019. Effective
July 1, 2014, the Plan was amended and restated to confirm that these Qualified Pension Plan amendments shall carry through to any applicable provision in
this Plan, including Article III and IV and all Annexes and Appendices to the Plan. Accordingly, base rate of pay, bonuses or other incentive compensation, or
other amounts earned for or relating to the period after December 31, 2015 shall not be used in determining benefits under the Plan, and service after
December 31, 2019 shall not be considered, deemed to be, or otherwise treated as Credited Service or similar benefit accrual service in determining benefits
payable under the Plan.
The Plan is hereby amended and restated, effective for terminations from active service and pre-retirement deaths on or after July 1, 2015, to update the
mortality table used for determining the present value of benefits accrued under the Plan after December 31, 2004 when an individual is eligible for a lump
sum payout of such benefits and for certain benefit conversions involving benefits accrued under the Plan after December 31, 2004, from the 1983 Group
Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction to the mortality table approved by the Internal Revenue Service for calculating the present value of benefits for
determining lump sums payable under Code section 417(e)(3); provided, however, the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction will be used
instead of the Code section 417(e)(3) applicable mortality table when use of the Code section 417(e)(3) applicable mortality table would cause a reduction in
the amount of benefits payable under the Plan.

EXECUTION COPY
ARTICLE II
DEFINITIONS
Unless the context indicates otherwise or the term is defined below, all terms shall be defined in accordance with the Lockheed Martin Corporation
Retirement Program.
1. ACTUARIAL EQUIVALENT – The Actuarial Equivalent shall mean a benefit which has the equivalent value computed using the interest rate
which would be used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to determine the present value of an immediate lump sum distribution on termination of a
pension plan, as in effect on the first day of the month of termination of employment plus one percent (1%), and the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table
with sex distinction; provided that for Years beginning on or after January 1, 2011, in no event shall the interest rate plus 1% exceed 7% or be less than 4%.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective for terminations from active service and pre-retirement deaths on or after July 1, 2015, the Actuarial Equivalent shall
mean a benefit which has the equivalent value computed using the interest rate which would be used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to
determine the present value of an immediate lump sum distribution on termination of a pension plan, as in effect on the first day of the month of termination
of employment plus one percent (1%), and the applicable mortality table under Code section 417(e)(3); provided that (i) in no event shall the interest rate plus
1% exceed 7% or be less than 4%, and (ii) if use of the applicable mortality table under Code section 417(e)(3) results in any Participant’s or Surviving
Spouse’s benefit under the Plan having an Actuarial Equivalent that is less than the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s or Surviving Spouse’s benefit
computed using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction, as determined at the time benefits become payable pursuant to Article V, then
the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s or Surviving Spouse’s Plan benefit will be computed using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex
distinction.

the Participant’s actual termination date, if earlier).
9. PARTICIPANT — An Eligible Employee who meets the requirements for participation contained in Article III or the Annexes; the term shall include

ARTICLE III
EXCESS BENEFIT PROVISIONS
1. Introduction. This Article sets forth the terms of the Plan relating to benefits determined by reference to the limitations imposed by Code section 415
and/or Code section 401(a)(17). This Article amends and restates the provisions relating to those benefits previously contained in the following plans:
 
- 8 -
EXECUTION COPY
 (a)the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan of Lockheed Martin Corporation (formerly known as the Supplemental Benefit Plan of Lockheed
Corporation);
 
 (b)the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan (formerly know as the Martin Marietta Corporation Supplemental
Excess Retirement Plan); and
 
 (c)the Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (formerly known as the Loral Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan).
2. Purpose. Benefits under this Article III supplement the benefits of Eligible Employees to the extent that such benefits cannot be paid from the
Company’s tax-qualified defined benefit plans because of the limitations on benefits contained in Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17). It is
intended that the provisions of this Article which relate to the limitations imposed by Code section 415 constitute a separate plan for purposes of
Section 3(36) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
3. Eligibility. An Eligible Employee who is entitled to benefits under a Qualified Pension Plan, and whose retirement income benefits are limited by the
provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan (as amended from time to time) relating to the limits under Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17) shall
receive benefits pursuant to this Article III.
4. Amount of Benefit. The benefit that each Participant shall be entitled to receive under the Plan is the amount reasonably determined by the Company
to be the difference between the Participant’s actual benefit under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan and the benefits that would have been payable under
that Plan if:
 
 (a)the Qualified Pension Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below; and
 
 (b)the Participant’s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable earnings under a Qualified Pension
Plan, the Participant’s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match” basis. The Participant’s annual compensation earned under the
MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable earnings. The average of the three (3) highest years of MICP compensation during the last
10 years shall be added to the average of the three (3) highest years of other pensionable earnings during the last 10 years to arrive at total final average
pensionable earnings for the applicable period under the Qualified Pension Plan.
 
- 9 -
EXECUTION COPY
Benefits under this Article III are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to
provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan on a “mix and match” basis and
without regard to the limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17). To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the applicable
Qualified Pension Plan (without regard of to the portion of the benefit attributable to employee contributions, if any) shall be calculated without reduction for
Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the applicable Qualified Pension Plan, and then reduced further by
the Grandfathered 2004 Benefit, then further reduced by the benefit payable from other nonqualified pension plans of the Company which corresponds to the
benefit payable under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan (including any benefit payable under Annex B of this Plan and excluding any nonqualified plans
designed to supplement qualified defined contribution plans) to the extent permitted under Code section 409A. The remaining benefit shall be paid from this
Plan pursuant to this Article III. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make such
adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article III shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary who is receiving or entitled to receive benefits with respect
to the Participant under the Qualified Pension Plan.
If the benefits payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’s retirement as a result of a general
increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan.
5. Plan Freeze. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, base rate of pay, bonuses or other incentive compensation, or other amounts earned for
or relating to the period after December 31, 2015 shall not be used in determining benefits under the Plan, and service after December 31, 2019 shall not be
considered, deemed to be, or otherwise treated as Credited Service or similar benefit accrual service in determining benefits payable under the Plan.
ARTICLE IV
SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS
In addition to the benefits described in Article III, the Plan also provides benefits to certain key management employees, as set forth in the Annexes.
Eligibility for, and the amount of, such benefits is set forth in the applicable Annex. Payment options for such benefits are described in Article V.

PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1. Vesting. Except as provided in Article VI, and subject to the Company’s right to discontinue the Plan as provided in Article VII, a Participant shall
have a non-forfeitable benefit payable under this Plan to the same extent as benefits are vested under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan. As provided in
Article VI, if a Participant acquires a right to receive payments under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor
of the Company.
2. Form and Timing of Payment. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Participant may make an initial payment election between an annuity and a
lump sum payment under the terms and conditions described in this Section 2. All elections under this Section 2 must be made in the form and manner
prescribed by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources. No election made pursuant to this Section 2 may affect a payment due in the same calendar year
in which the election is made or accelerate payment into the calendar year in which the election is made.
a. Regular Form. Unless a Participant has elected a lump sum payment under Section 2.b of this Article V, benefits under this Plan shall be paid
in the form of an annuity. Participants who first become eligible for participation in the Plan after December 16, 2005 shall receive their benefits in the form
of an annuity. Benefits paid in a form described in this Section 2.a. shall commence as soon as administratively practicable (but no more than 90 days)
following the later of (i) the month in which the Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five
(55). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, benefits paid in a form described in this Section 2.a. to a Participant who is reasonably determined by the
Company to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code section 409A(2)(B)(i), shall not commence before the later of (i) six (6) months following
the month in which the Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be
paid between the date of Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date.
i. Selection of Annuity Form. Prior to his Termination of Employment or attainment of age 55, as applicable, a Participant may elect to
receive benefits in any actuarially equivalent annuity form that is available under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan on the date of the Participant’s
election that has been designated by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources as available for election under this Plan. If the Participant has not validly
elected an annuity form before his Termination of Employment or attainment of age 55, as applicable, under this Section 2.a. or a lump sum payment as
provided in Section 2.b. of Article V, (i) an unmarried Participant shall be deemed to have elected payment in the form of a monthly annuity for the life of the
Participant with no further payments to anyone after his or her death, and (ii) a married Participant shall be deemed to have elected payment in the form of a
reduced monthly annuity for the life of the Participant with, after the Participant’s death, a 50% survivor annuity for the life of the Participant’s spouse.
Actuarial adjustments shall be based on the factors set forth in the Qualified Pension Plan.

EXECUTION COPY
b. Lump Sum Option. This Section shall not apply to Participants who first become eligible for participation in the Plan after December 16, 2005.
In lieu of the forms described in Section 2.a. of Article V, a Participant may make a one-time initial election to receive a full lump sum payment in an amount
which is the Actuarial Equivalent of a monthly annuity for the life of the Participant with no further payments to anyone after his or her death, provided the
election is filed with the Company in writing no later than December 31, 2008 (or such other date determined by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources
and communicated to Participants) and the Participant’s employment has not terminated employment prior to filing the election. For all Participants who elect
a lump sum under this Section 2.b., the lump sum payment shall be made six (6) months following the later of (i) the month in which the Participant has a
Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of
Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date. All elections under this Section 2.b. must be made in the form and
manner prescribed by the Company. Such election shall be irrevocable except as provided in Section 2(e) of Article V.
c. Cash-out of Small Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, if the Value of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary under
this Plan does not exceed $10,000, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum payment in full discharge of all liabilities with respect to such benefits.
For purposes of this Section, Value shall be determined as of the Participant’s Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable,
and shall mean the present value of a Participant’s or Beneficiary’s benefits, excluding the Grandfathered 2004 Benefit, based (i) for Terminations of
Employment prior to January 1, 2008 upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate in Code section 417(e)(3)(ii), or for terminations on or
after January 1, 2008, upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate under Code section 417(e)(3), as amended by the Pension Protection Act
of 2006, for the calendar month preceding the Plan Year in which the termination of employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55) occurs. Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, benefits paid under this Section 2.c. to a Participant who is reasonably determined by the Company to be a “specified employee”
within the meaning of Code section 409A(2)(B)(i), shall not commence before six (6) months following the later of (i) the month in which the Participant has
a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between the date of Termination
of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date.
d. Payment Upon Death or Disability.
i. Death. No other death benefits are provided under this Plan other than as specified in this Section 2.d.i.

EXECUTION COPY
A. Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit. In the event the Participant dies prior to terminating employment or attaining age 55, a pre-
retirement survivor benefit will be payable to the Participant’s surviving spouse (if any) (the “Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit” and the “Surviving Spouse”)
in the form elected by the Participant under the terms of the Plan. If the Participant’s benefit was payable in a lump sum, the lump sum shall be the Actuarial
Equivalent of a monthly annuity payable for the life of the Surviving Spouse with no further payments to anyone after his or her death. The Pre-Retirement
Survivor Benefit shall commence as soon as administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days) following the later of (i) the month in which the
Participant dies, or (ii) the month in which the Participant would have attained age fifty-five (55). No Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit is payable to anyone
other than the Participant’s Surviving Spouse. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to all Participants who elected a lump sum under Section 2.b., a
lump sum Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit shall be paid to the Participant’s Surviving Spouse six (6) months following the later of (i) the month in which the
Participant dies, or (ii) the month in which the Participant would have attained age fifty-five (55).
B. Death After Termination of Employment or Attainment of Age 55. If a Participant who is required to wait six (6) months for a
lump sum payment (in accordance with Section 2 of Article V) dies after the Participant’s Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as
applicable, but before payment is made, the lump sum payment shall be made to the Participant’s Beneficiary as administratively practicable (but no later than
90 days) following the death of the Participant.
ii. Disability. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article V, the benefit of a Disabled Participant who is eligible for a disability
pension from the Lockheed Martin Retirement Income Plan, the KAPL Inc. Pension Plan for Salaried Employees, or the Lockheed Martin Corporation
Retirement Income Plan III shall be paid in the form elected by the Participant under the terms of the Plan as soon as administratively practicable (but no later
than 90 days) following the date the Participant is reasonably determined by the Company to be Disabled. For the purposes of this Section 2.d.ii., the terms
“Disabled” or “Disability” shall have the meaning set forth in the Lockheed Martin Retirement Income Plan, the KAPL Inc. Pension Plan for Salaried
Employees, or the Lockheed Martin Corporation Retirement Income Plan III, as applicable, to the extent consistent with the requirements of Code section
409A(a)(2)(C).
e. Prospective Change of Payment Elections. Participants may elect to change the form of payment of benefits or further delay the
commencement of benefits as provided in this Section 2.e. All elections under this Section 2.e. must be made in the form and manner prescribed by the
Company. This Section 2.e. does not apply to Surviving Spouses or Beneficiaries. Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, other changes in the
form of benefit, including changes between actuarially equivalent forms of benefit, if any, may be made only as determined by the Senior Vice President,
Human Resources, of the Company in accordance with Code section 409A.

EXECUTION COPY
i. Form of Payment. A Participant who has validly elected (or deemed to have elected) payment as an annuity (as described in
Section 2.a. of Article V) or has validly elected a lump sum payment (in accordance with Section 2.b. of Article V) may later elect to receive payment in any
form (annuity or lump sum) designated by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, of the Company, provided that such election is made in the form and
manner determined by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources not less than twelve (12) months before the date the payment would have first
commenced under the Participant’s prior election. In addition, the first payment under the new election must commence no earlier than sixty (60) months
from the date when the payment would have first commenced under the Participant’s prior election. Such change in election shall not be given effect until
twelve (12) months from the date that the change in election is delivered to the Company.
ii. Timing of Payment. Regardless of the form of payment, a Participant may elect to delay payment of his benefit provided such election
is made in writing in the form and manner determined by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, not less than twelve (12) months before the date the
payment would have first commenced under the Participant’s prior election. In addition, the first payment under the new election must commence no earlier
than sixty (60) months from when the payment would have first commenced under the Participant’s prior election. No interest shall be paid between the date
of termination of employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date. Such change in election shall not be given effect until
twelve (12) months from the date that the change in election is delivered to the Company.
This Section 2.e. does not apply to Surviving Spouses or Beneficiaries.
f. Notwithstanding the above, for periods prior to January 1, 2009, (or such later date as may be provided by the Internal Revenue Service in
guidance of general applicability), the Senior Vice President, Human Resources may provide alternative rules for elections with respect to the commencement
of payment and form of payment, provided that such rules conform to Code section 409A and Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder.
g. If a Participant participates in more than one supplemental pension plan sponsored by the Corporation, the Participant must make a single
election that shall apply to his or her benefits under all such plans with respect to the form of annuity (under Section 2.a. of this Article 5) and with respect to
prospective changes of payment (under Section 2.e. of this Article 5).
3. Deductibility of Payments. Subject to the provisions of Section Code section 409A, in the event that the Company reasonably anticipates that the
payment of benefits in accordance with the Participant’s election under Section 2 would prevent the Company from claiming an income tax deduction with
respect to any portion of the benefits paid under Code section 162(m), the Committee shall have the right to delay the timing of distributions from the
 
- 14 -
EXECUTION COPY
Participant’s Account as necessary to maximize the Company’s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a delayed distribution schedule, the
Committee shall undertake to have distributions made at such times and in such amounts as the Company reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably
anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year, the deduction will not be barred by Code section 162(m) or upon a Termination of Employment in
accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-2(b)(7)(i), consistent with the objective of maximum deductibility for the Company. The Committee
shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’s Account Balance or to pay aggregate benefits less than the Participant’s Account Balance in the event that all
or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the Company. All scheduled payments under this Plan and any other plan required to be aggregated with this
Plan must be delayed in order for such payment to be delayed pursuant to this Section 3.
4. Change of Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Committee determines in good faith, based on consultation with counsel and
in accordance with the requirements of Code section 409A, that the federal income tax treatment or legal status of this Plan has or may be adversely affected
by a change in the Code, Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or other applicable law or by an administrative or judicial
construction thereof, the Committee may direct that the benefits of affected Participants or of all Participants be distributed as soon as practicable after such
determination is made, to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by the Committee to cure or mitigate the consequences, or possible consequences of, such
change in law or interpretation thereof.
5. Acceleration upon Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the accrued benefit of each Participant shall be one-hundred
percent (100%) vested and be distributed in a single lump sum within fifteen (15) calendar days following a “Change in Control.”
For purposes of this Plan, a Change in Control shall include and be deemed to occur upon the following events:
 
 (a)A tender offer or exchange offer is consummated for the ownership of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined
voting power of the Company’s then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
 
 (b)The Company is merged, combined, consolidated, recapitalized or otherwise reorganized with one or more other entities that are not Company
Subsidiaries and, as a result of the merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization or other reorganization, less than 75% of the outstanding
voting securities of the surviving or resulting corporation shall immediately after the event be owned in the aggregate by the stockholders of the
Company (directly or indirectly), determined on the basis of record ownership as of the date of determination of holders entitled to vote on the
action (or in the absence of a vote, the day immediately prior to the event).

EXECUTION COPY
 (c)Any person (as this term is used in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, but excluding any person described in and satisfying the
conditions of Rule 13d-1(b)(1) thereunder), becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities
entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
 
 (d)At any time within any period of two years after a tender offer, merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization, or other reorganization or a
contested election, or any combination of these events, the “Incumbent Directors” shall cease to constitute at least a majority of the authorized
number of members of the Board. For purposes hereof, “Incumbent Directors” shall mean the persons who were members of the Board
immediately before the first of these events and the persons who were elected or nominated as their successors or pursuant to increases in the size
of the Board by a vote of at least three-fourths of the Board members who were then Board members (or successors or additional members so
elected or nominated).
 
 (e)The stockholders of the Company approve a plan of liquidation and dissolution or the sale or transfer of substantially all of the Company’s
business and/or assets as an entirety to an entity that is not a Company Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no distribution shall be made solely on account of a Change in Control and prior to the benefit commencement
date specified in Section 2 of Article V unless the Change in Control is both an event qualifying for a distribution of deferred compensation under
Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code and an event qualifying under this Section 5. This Section 5 shall apply only to a Change in Control of Lockheed
Martin Corporation and shall not cause immediate payout of benefits under this Plan in any transaction involving the Company’s sale, liquidation, merger, or
other disposition of any subsidiary.
The Committee may cancel or modify this Section 5 at any time prior to a Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, this Section 5
shall remain in force and effect, and shall not be subject to cancellation or modification for a period of five years, and any defined term used in Section 5 shall
not, for purposes of Section 5, be subject to cancellation or modification during the five year period.
6. Tax Withholding. To the extent required by law, the Company shall withhold from benefit payments hereunder any Federal, state, or local income or
payroll taxes required to be withheld and shall furnish the recipient and the applicable government agency or agencies with such reports, statements, or
information as may be legally required. No benefit payments shall be made to the Participant until the withholding obligation for taxes under Code sections
3101(a) and 3101(b) has been satisfied with respect to the Participant.

7. Retiree Medical Withholding. A Participant may direct the Company to withhold from the Participant’s benefit payments hereunder all or a portion
of the amount that the Participant is required to pay for Company-provided retiree medical coverage.
8. Reemployment. The retirement benefit otherwise payable hereunder to any Participant who previously retired or otherwise had a Termination of
Employment and is subsequently reemployed may not be suspended during the Participant’s period of reemployment except as permitted under Code section
409A.
9. Mistaken Payments. No Participant or Beneficiary shall have any right to any payment made (1) in error, (2) in contravention to the terms of the
Plan, the Code, or ERISA, or (3) because the Committee or its delegates were not informed of any death. The Committee shall have full rights under the law
and ERISA to recover any such mistaken payment, and the right to recover attorney’s fees and other costs incurred with respect to such recovery. Recovery
shall be made from future Plan payments, or by any other available means.
ARTICLE VI
EXTENT OF PARTICIPANTS’ RIGHTS
1. Unfunded Status of Plan. This Plan constitutes a mere contractual promise by the Company to make payments in the future, and each Participant’s
rights shall be those of a general, unsecured creditor of the Company. No Participant shall have any beneficial interest in any specific assets that the Company
may hold or set aside in connection with this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to assist the Company in meeting its obligations under this Plan, the
Company may set aside assets in a trust or trusts described in Revenue Procedure 92-64, 1992-2 C.B. 422, and the Company may direct that its obligations
under this Plan be satisfied by payments out of such trust or trusts. The assets of any such trust will remain subject to the claims of the general creditors of the
Company. It is the Company’s intention that the Plan be unfunded for Federal income tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974.
2. Nonalienability of Benefits. A Participant’s rights under this Plan shall not be assignable or transferable and any purported transfer, assignment,
pledge or other encumbrance or attachment of any payments or benefits under this Plan, or any interest therein shall not be permitted or recognized, other than
the designation of, or passage of payment rights to, a Beneficiary or transfer of an interest in this Plan to a Participant’s spouse, former spouse, or child
incident to divorce under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (which shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with Code sections 414(p)(1)(B)
and 409A), provided that the form of payment designated in such order is an annuity as provided in Section 2.a. of Article V.

EXECUTION COPY
3. Forfeiture. If, following the date on which a Participant shall retire under this Plan, a Participant shall engage in the operation or management of a
business, whether as owner, stockholder, partner, officer, employee, consultant, or otherwise, which at such time is in competition with the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, or shall disclose to unauthorized persons information relative to the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which the Participant
shall have reason to believe is confidential, or otherwise act, or conduct oneself, in a manner which the Participant shall have reason to believe is contrary to
the best interest of the Company, or shall be found by the Committee to have committed an act during the term of the Participant’s employment which would
have justified the Participant being discharged for cause, the Participant’s retirement benefit under this Plan shall terminate. Application of this Section will
be at the discretion of the Committee.
ARTICLE VII
AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION
1. Amendment. The Board or its authorized delegate may amend, modify, suspend or discontinue this Plan at any time subject to any shareholder
approval that may be required under applicable law, provided, however, that no such amendment shall have the effect of reducing a Participant’s accrued
benefit or postponing the time when a Participant is entitled to receive a distribution of his accrued benefit unless each affected Participant consents to such
change.
2. Termination. The Board reserves the right to terminate this Plan at any time and at such times that the Board reasonably determines in its discretion is
appropriate and conforms to the requirements of Code section 409A, to pay all Participants their accrued benefits in a lump sum or to make other provisions
for the payment of benefits (e.g. purchase of annuities) immediately following such termination or at such time thereafter as the Board may determine.
3. Transfer of Liability. The Board reserves the right to transfer to another entity all of the obligations of Company with respect to a Participant under
this Plan if such entity agrees pursuant to a binding written agreement with the Company or its subsidiaries to assume all of the obligations of the Company
under this Plan with respect to such Participant.
4. Merger. The Board reserves the right to merge all or part of this Plan with or into another plan, provided (1) such other plan preserves all of the
obligations of the Company under this Plan with respect to such Participant and (2) each Participant in the Plan would (if the Plan then terminated) receive a
benefit immediately after the merger which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger (if the
Plan had then terminated).

ARTICLE VIII
ADMINISTRATION
1. The Committee. This Plan shall be administered by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board or such other
committee of the Board as may be designated by the Board. The members of the Committee shall be designated by the Board. A majority of the members of
the Committee (but not fewer than two) shall constitute a quorum. The vote of a majority of a quorum or the unanimous written consent of the Committee
shall constitute action by the Committee. The Committee and its delegates shall have full discretion to construe and interpret the terms and provisions of the
Plan, which interpretation or construction shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties, including but not limited to the Company and any Participant or
Beneficiary, except as otherwise provided by law. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan or in any document issued under the Plan, it is intended that
the Plan will at all times conform to the requirements of Code section 409A, including the rules for “grandfathered” benefits under Code section 409A, and
any regulations or other guidance issued thereunder, and that the provisions of the Plan will be interpreted to meet such requirements. If any provision of the
Plan is determined not to conform to such requirements, the Plan shall be interpreted to omit such offending provision.
2. Delegation and Reliance. The Committee may delegate to the officers or employees of the Company the authority to execute and deliver those
instruments and documents, to do all acts and things, and to take all other steps deemed necessary, advisable or convenient for the effective administration of
this Plan in accordance with its terms and purpose. In making any determination or in taking or not taking any action under this Plan, the Committee may
obtain and rely upon the advice of experts, including professional advisors to the Company. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6, the Committee
delegates the authority to adjudicate claims to the Pension Plans Administrative Committee. No member of the Committee or officer of the Company who is a
Participant hereunder may participate in any decision specifically relating to his or her individual rights or benefits under the Plan.
3. Exculpation and Indemnity. Neither the Company nor any member of the Board or of the Committee, nor any other person participating in any
determination of any question under this Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, shall have any liability to any party for any action
taken or not taken in good faith under this Plan or for the failure of the Plan or any Participant’s rights under the Plan to achieve intended tax consequences, or
to comply with any other law, compliance with which is not required on the part of the Company.

4. Facility of Payment. If a minor, person declared incompetent, or person incapable of handling the disposition of his or her property is entitled to
receive a benefit, make an application, or make an election hereunder, the Committee or the Pension Plans Administrative Committee may direct that such
benefits be paid to, or such application or election be made by, the guardian, legal representative, or person having the care and custody of such minor,
incompetent, or incapable person. Any payment made, application allowed, or election implemented in accordance with this Section shall completely
discharge the Company and the Committee (or Pension Plans Administrative Committee) from all liability with respect thereto.
5. Proof of Claims. The Claims Administrator may require proof of the death, disability, incompetency, minority, or incapacity of any Participant or

to be understood by claimant: (1) the specific reason or reasons for the denial; (2) specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the
denial is based; (3) a description of any additional materials or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of

(5) a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse determination on review. The 90
day period may be extended for not more than an additional 90 days if special circumstances make such an extension necessary. The Claims
Administrator shall give the claimant, before the end of the initial 90 day period, a written notice of such extension, stating such special
circumstances and the date by which the Claims Administrator expects to render a decision.
 
 (b)By a written application filed with the Claims Administrator within 60 days after receipt by claimant of the written notice described in paragraph
(a), the claimant or his duly authorized representative may request review of the denial of his claim.
 
- 20 -
EXECUTION COPY
 (c)In connection with such review, the claimant or his duly authorized representative may submit issues, comments, documents, records and other
information relating to the claim for benefits to the Claims Administrator. In addition, the claimant will be provided, upon request and free of
charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, or other information “relevant” to claimant’s claim for benefits. A document,
record, or other information is “relevant” if it: (1) was relied upon in making the benefit determination; (2) was submitted, considered or
generated in the course of making the benefit determination, without regard to whether such document, record or information was relied upon in
making the benefit determination; or (3) demonstrates compliance with administrative processes and safeguards required under federal law.
 
 (d)The Plan will provide an impartial review that takes into account all comments, records and other information submitted by the claimant relating
to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The Claims
Administrator shall make a decision and furnish such decision in writing to the claimant within 60 days after receipt by the Claims Administrator
of the request for review. This period may be extended to not more than 120 days after such receipt if special circumstances make such an
extension necessary. The claimant will be notified in writing prior to the expiration of the original 60 day period if such an extension is required,
and such notice will include the reason for the extension and the date by which it is expected that a decision will be reached. The decision on
review shall be in writing, set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include: (1) the specific reasons for the
decision; (2) specific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based; (3) a statement that the claimant is entitled to
receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, and other information “relevant” to the
claimant’s claim for benefits; (4) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an
explanation of why such material or information is necessary; (5) a statement describing any voluntary appeal procedures and the claimant’s right
to obtain information about such procedures, if any; and (6) a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of
ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review.

EXECUTION COPY
 (e)If in the event that the reviewing committee must make a determination of disability in order to decide a claim, the reviewing committee shall
follow the special claims procedures for disability benefits described in Department of Labor Regulation section 2560.503-1(d). The reviewing
committee shall render a decision within a reasonable time (not to exceed 90 days) after the claimant’s request for review, rather than within 120
days as set forth in the above paragraph.
 
 (f)The Claims Administrator shall be the Lockheed Martin Corporation Pension Plans Administrative Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
with respect to claims and appeals brought by elected officers of the Company, the Claims Administrator shall be the Committee.
ARTICLE IX
GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
1. This Plan shall not in any way obligate the Company to continue the employment of a Participant with the Company, nor does this Plan limit the
right of the Company at any time and for any reason to terminate the Participant’s employment. In no event shall this Plan constitute an employment contract

Committee may perform such other act as it in good faith determines will most nearly carry out the intent and the purpose of this Plan.

ANNEX B TO JANUARY 1, 2005 RESTATEMENT
Additional Benefits Previously Provided under the
Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan
1. Introduction. The benefits described in this Annex previously were provided as part of the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Excess
Retirement Plan. That Plan was formerly known as the Martin Marietta Corporation Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan, and included provisions
previously contained in the Lockheed Martin Supplemental Retirement Income Plan.
2. Purpose. This Annex provides a supplemental benefit to salaried employees who were considered highly compensated employees as of
December 31, 1990 and who were also participants in the Martin Marietta Corporation Retirement Income Plan as of September 30, 1975, whose benefits are
limited by Code section 401(a)(4).
3. Eligibility. This Annex provides benefits to salaried employees who were considered highly compensated employees as of December 31, 1990 (as
determined under the Martin Marietta Corporation Retirement Income Plan as in effect on that date) and who were also covered employees in the Martin
Marietta Corporation Retirement Income Plan as of September 30, 1975 or were participants for 12 consecutive months prior to September 30, 1975 who
receive a pension benefit calculated under the Pre-ERISA formula in the Martin Marietta Corporation Retirement Income Plan.
4. Amount of Benefit. Participants shall receive a retirement benefit from this Plan that is reasonably determined by the Company to equal to the
excess, if any, of (1) the pension benefit calculated based on the formula described in Article V(1)(b) or Article IX(2)(b) of the January 1, 1995 Martin
Marietta Corporation Retirement Income Plan without regard to the limitation described in Article V(1)(c), Article IX(2)(c) or Code section 415 or Code
section 401(a)(17), reduced by the greater of the pension benefits described in Article V(1)(b) or Article IX(2)(b) of the January 1, 1995 Retirement Income
Plan. To prevent duplication of benefits, the benefit payable under this Annex shall be coordinated with any benefit payable under Article III of the Plan, as
set forth in Article III.
In no event shall the computation of benefits under this Annex take into account any service performed by a Participant after separation from
employment with the Company or its subsidiaries.

ARTICLE III
EXCESS BENEFIT PROVISIONS
1. Introduction. This Article sets forth the terms of the Plan relating to benefits determined by reference to the limitations imposed by Code section 415
and/or Code section 401(a)(17). This Article amends and restates the provisions relating to those benefits previously contained in the following plans:
 
 (a)the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan of Lockheed Martin Corporation (formerly known as the Supplemental Benefit Plan of Lockheed
Corporation);
 
 (b)the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan (formerly know as the Martin Marietta Corporation Supplemental
Excess Retirement Plan); and
 
 (c)the Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (formerly known as the Loral Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan).
2. Purpose. Benefits under this Article III supplement the benefits of Eligible Employees to the extent that such benefits cannot be paid from the
Company’s tax-qualified defined benefit plans because of the limitations on benefits contained in Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17). It is
intended that the provisions of this Article which relate to the limitations imposed by Code section 415 constitute a separate plan for purposes of
Section 3(36) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
3. Eligibility. An Eligible Employee who is entitled to benefits under a Qualified Pension Plan, and whose retirement income benefits are limited by the
provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan (as amended from time to time) relating to the limits under Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17) shall
receive benefits pursuant to this Article III.
4. Amount of Benefit. The benefit that each Participant shall be entitled to receive is the difference between the Participant’s actual benefit under the
applicable Qualified Pension Plan and the benefits that would have been payable under that Plan if:
 
 (a)the Qualified Pension Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below; and
 
 (b)the Participant’s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable earnings under a Qualified Pension
Plan, the Participant’s total
 
- 30 -
EXECUTION COPY
pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match” basis. The Participant’s annual compensation earned under the MICP shall be calculated
separately from other annual pensionable earnings. The average of the three (3) highest years of MICP compensation during the last 10 years shall be added
to the average of the three (3) highest years of other pensionable earnings during the last 10 years to arrive at total final average pensionable earnings for the
applicable period under the Qualified Pension Plan.
Benefits under this Article III are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan as necessary
to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan on a “mix and match” basis
and without regard to the limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17). To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the applicable
Qualified Pension Plan shall be calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the
applicable Qualified Pension Plan, and then reduced further by the benefit payable from other nonqualified pension plans of the Company which corresponds
to the benefit payable under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan (including any benefit payable under Annex B of this Plan and excluding any nonqualified
plans designed to supplement qualified defined contribution plans). The remaining benefit shall be paid from this Plan pursuant to this Article III. Participants
have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as
the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article III shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who is receiving or entitled to
receive benefits with respect to the Participant under the Qualified Pension Plan.
If the benefits payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’s retirement as a result of a
general increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan unless the Committee expressly so
provides in writing.
5. Plan Freeze. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, base rate of pay, bonuses or other incentive compensation, or other amounts earned for
or relating to the period after December 31, 2015 shall not be used in determining benefits under the Plan, and service after December 31, 2019 shall not be
considered, deemed to be, or otherwise treated as Credited Service or similar benefit accrual service in determining benefits payable under the Plan.

ARTICLE IV
SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS
In addition to the benefits described in Article III, the Plan also provides benefits to certain key management employees, as set forth in the Annexes.
Eligibility for, and the amount of, such benefits is set forth in the applicable Annex. Payment options for such benefits are described in Article V.

EXECUTION COPY
ARTICLE V
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1. Vesting. Except as provided in Article VI, and subject to the Company’s right to discontinue the Plan as provided in Article VII, a Participant shall
have a non-forfeitable benefit payable under this Plan to the same extent as benefits are vested under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan. As provided in
Article VI, if a Participant acquires a right to receive payments under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor
of the Company.
2. Form of Payment. Benefits shall be paid in the same form at the same times and for the same period as benefits are paid with respect to the
Participant under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan, except as provided in the following paragraphs. Actuarial adjustments shall be based on the factors
set forth in the Qualified Pension Plan, except as provided in the following paragraphs. If the benefits payable under this Plan correspond to Qualified Pension
Plan benefits with multiple commencement dates, each portion of the benefits payable under this Plan shall be paid at the same time as the corresponding
portion of the benefits is paid from the Qualified Pension Plan. If an Employee’s benefits under the Qualified Pension Plan are suspended for any month in
accordance with the re-employment provisions thereof, the Participant’s benefit for that month shall likewise be suspended under this Plan.
Lump Sum Option. A Participant may irrevocably elect to receive a full or partial single lump sum payment in an amount which is the
Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit described above, and with no interest for the period between the date of termination of employment and the payment date.
This election must be made within the time period for electing the form of benefit under the corresponding Qualified Pension Plan, by filing a written election
in the form and manner prescribed by the Company. Payment will be made six (6) months following the date payments would otherwise begin pursuant to the
above paragraph.
Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit. In the event the Participant dies prior to the date his or her retirement has commenced under this Plan
and the corresponding Qualified Pension Plan, the pre-retirement survivor benefit payable to the surviving spouse (if any) under this Plan (the “Pre-
Retirement Survivor Benefit” and the “Surviving Spouse”) will be payable, at the election of the Surviving Spouse, in any of the following forms:
 
 (a)in the form of a monthly annuity payable to the Surviving Spouse for his lifetime, with no further payments to anyone after his death (which will
be referred to as the “Regular Form”);
 
- 33 -
EXECUTION COPY
 (b)in the form of a lump sum payment which is the Actuarial Equivalent of the Regular Form (the “100% Lump Sum”), but with Actuarial
Equivalent determined as of the Election Date , and with no interest for the period between the Election Date (or, if later, the date the Participant
would have attained age 55 had he survived) and the payment date; or
 
 (c)in the form of a combined lump sum and life annuity benefit of (x) and (y), where (x) equals a lump sum amount selected by the Surviving
Spouse which is less than the 100% Lump Sum and (y) is a monthly single life annuity for the life of Surviving Spouse (with no further payments
to anyone after his death) in an amount that can be provided with the difference between (x) and the 100% Lump Sum.
Any election to receive the benefit in the form of a lump sum as set forth in (b) above or a combined lump sum and annuity as set forth in (c) above must be
made by the Surviving Spouse no later than 90 days after the date of the Participant’s death or, if later, the date the Participant would have attained age 55 had
he survived (with the date such election is made by the Surviving Spouse referred to as the “Election Date”). In the event the Surviving Spouse makes an
election for a lump sum or partial lump sum payment within this period, payment will not be made to the Surviving Spouse until six months after the Election
Date (or, if later, six months after the date the benefit would otherwise be payable under this Plan).
Cash-out of Small Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, if the Value of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary under this
Plan does not exceed the amount that may be distributed without consent under Section 411(a)(11) of the Code, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump
sum payment in full discharge of all liabilities with respect to such benefits. For purposes of this Section, Value shall be determined as of the Participant’s
termination of employment, and shall mean the present value of a Participant’s or Beneficiary’s benefits based upon the applicable mortality table and
applicable interest rate in Code section 417(e)(3)(ii) for the calendar month preceding the Plan Year in which the termination of employment occurs.
3. Deductibility of Payments. In the event that the payment of benefits under Section 2 would prevent the Company from claiming an income tax
deduction with respect to any portion of the benefits paid, the Committee shall have the right to modify the form and timing of distributions as necessary to
maximize the Company’s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a modified distribution schedule, the Committee shall undertake to have
distributions made at such times and in such amounts as most closely approximate the payment method described in Section 2, consistent with the objective
of maximum deductibility for the Company. The Committee shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’s accrued benefit under this Plan or to pay
aggregate benefits less than the Participant’s accrued benefit in the event that all or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the Company.
 
- 34 -
EXECUTION COPY
4. Change of Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Committee determines in good faith, based on consultation with counsel, that
the federal income tax treatment or legal status of this Plan has or may be adversely affected by a change in the Code, Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, or other applicable law or by an administrative or judicial construction thereof, the Committee may direct that the benefits of
affected Participants or of all Participants be distributed as soon as practicable after such determination is made, to the extent deemed necessary or advisable
by the Committee to cure or mitigate the consequences, or possible consequences of, such change in law or interpretation thereof.
5. Acceleration upon Change in Control.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the accrued benefit of each Participant shall be distributed in a single lump sum within fifteen
(15) calendar days following a “Change in Control.”
For purposes of this Plan, a Change in Control shall include and be deemed to occur upon the following events:
 
 (a)A tender offer or exchange offer is consummated for the ownership of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined
voting power of the Company’s then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
 
 (b)The Company is merged, combined, consolidated, recapitalized or otherwise reorganized with one or more other entities that are not Subsidiaries
and, as a result of the merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization or other reorganization, less than 75% of the outstanding voting
securities of the surviving or resulting corporation shall immediately after the event be owned in the aggregate by the stockholders of the
Company (directly or indirectly), determined on the basis of record ownership as of the date of determination of holders entitled to vote on the
action (or in the absence of a vote, the day immediately prior to the event).
 
 (c)Any person (as this term is used in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, but excluding any person described in and satisfying the
conditions of Rule 13d-1(b)(1) thereunder), becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities
entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
 
 (d)At any time within any period of two years after a tender offer, merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization, or other reorganization or a
 
- 35 -
EXECUTION COPY
 contested election, or any combination of these events, the “Incumbent Directors” shall cease to constitute at least a majority of the authorized
number of members of the Board. For purposes hereof, “Incumbent Directors” shall mean the persons who were members of the Board
immediately before the first of these events and the persons who were elected or nominated as their successors or pursuant to increases in the size
of the Board by a vote of at least three-fourths of the Board members who were then Board members (or successors or additional members so
elected or nominated).
 
 (e)The stockholders of the Company approve a plan of liquidation and dissolution or the sale or transfer of substantially all of the Company’s
business and/or assets as an entirety to an entity that is not a Subsidiary.
This Section 5 shall apply only to a Change in Control of Lockheed Martin Corporation and shall not cause immediate payout of benefits under
this Plan in any transaction involving the Company’s sale, liquidation, merger, or other disposition of any subsidiary.
The Committee may cancel or modify this Section 5 at any time prior to a Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, this Section 5
shall remain in force and effect, and shall not be subject to cancellation or modification for a period of five years, and any defined term used in Section 6 shall
not, for purposes of Section 5, be subject to cancellation or modification during the five year period
6. Tax Withholding. To the extent required by law, the Company shall withhold from benefit payments hereunder any Federal, state, or local income or
payroll taxes required to be withheld and shall furnish the recipient and the applicable government agency or agencies with such reports, statements, or
information as may be legally required. No benefit payments shall be made to the Participant until the withholding obligation for taxes under Code sections
3101(a) and 3101(b) has been satisfied with respect to the Participant.
7. Retiree Medical Withholding. A Participant may direct the Company to withhold from the Participant’s benefit payments hereunder all or a portion
of the amount that the Participant is required to pay for Company-provided retiree medical coverage.
8. Reemployment. The retirement benefit otherwise payable hereunder to any Participant who previously retired or otherwise had a Termination of
Employment and is subsequently reemployed shall be treated in a manner consistent with the treatment of the benefit under the applicable Qualified Plan.
9. Mistaken Payments. No participant or Beneficiary shall have any right to any payment made (1) in error, (2) in contravention to the terms of the
Plan, the Code, or ERISA, or (3) because the Committee or its delegates were not informed of any death. The Committee shall have full rights under the law
and ERISA to recover any such mistaken payment, and the right to recover attorney’s fees and other costs incurred with respect to such recovery. Recovery
shall be made from future Plan payments, or by any other available means.

EXECUTION COPY
ARTICLE VI
EXTENT OF PARTICIPANTS’ RIGHTS
1. Unfunded Status of Plan. This Plan constitutes a mere contractual promise by the Company to make payments in the future, and each Participant’s
rights shall be those of a general, unsecured creditor of the Company. No Participant shall have any beneficial interest in any specific assets that the Company
may hold or set aside in connection with this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to assist the Company in meeting its obligations under this Plan, the
Company may set aside assets in a trust or trusts described in Revenue Procedure 92-64, 1992-2 C.B. 422, and the Company may direct that its obligations
under this Plan be satisfied by payments out of such trust or trusts. The assets of any such trust will remain subject to the claims of the general creditors of the
Company. It is the Company’s intention that the Plan be unfunded for Federal income tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974.
2. Nonalienability of Benefits. A Participant’s rights under this Plan shall not be assignable or transferable and any purported transfer, assignment,
pledge or other encumbrance or attachment of any payments or benefits under this Plan, or any interest therein shall not be permitted or recognized, other than
the designation of, or passage of payment rights to, a Beneficiary or transfer of an interest in this Plan to a Participant’s former spouse incident to divorce
under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.
3. Forfeiture. If, following the date on which a Participant shall retire under this Plan, a Participant shall engage in the operation or management of a
business, whether as owner, stockholder, partner, officer, employee, consultant, or otherwise, which at such time is in competition with the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, or shall disclose to unauthorized persons information relative to the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which the Participant
shall have reason to believe is confidential, or otherwise act, or conduct oneself, in a manner which the Participant shall have reason to believe is contrary to
the best interest of the Company, or shall be found by the Committee to have committed an act during the term of the Participant’s employment which would
have justified the Participant being discharged for cause, the Participant’s retirement benefit under this Plan shall terminate. Application of this Section will
be at the discretion of the Committee.

ARTICLE VII
AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION
1. Amendment. The Board or its authorized delegate may amend, modify, suspend or discontinue this Plan at any time subject to any shareholder
approval that may be required under applicable law, provided, however, that no such amendment shall have the effect of reducing a Participant’s accrued
benefit or postponing the time when a Participant is entitled to receive a distribution of his accrued benefit unless each affected Participant consents to such
change.
2. Termination. The Board reserves the right to terminate this Plan at any time and to pay all Participants their accrued benefits in a lump sum or to
make other provisions for the payment of benefits (e.g. purchase of annuities) immediately following such termination or at such time thereafter as the Board
may determine.
3. Transfer of Liability. The Board reserves the right to transfer to another entity all of the obligations of Company with respect to a Participant under
this Plan if such entity agrees pursuant to a binding written agreement with the Company or its subsidiaries to assume all of the obligations of the Company
under this Plan with respect to such Participant.
4. Merger. The Board reserves the right to merge all or part of this Plan with or into another plan, provided (1) such other plan preserves all of the
obligations of the Company under this Plan with respect to such Participant and (2) each Participant in the Plan would (if the Plan then terminated) receive a
benefit immediately after the merger which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger (if the
Plan had then terminated).

1. The Committee. This Plan shall be administered by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board or such other
committee of the Board as may be designated by the Board. The members of the Committee shall be designated by the Board. A majority of the members of
the Committee (but not fewer than two) shall constitute a quorum. The vote of a majority of a quorum or the unanimous written consent of the Committee
shall constitute action by the Committee. The Committee and its delegates (including the Claims Administrator) shall have full discretion to construe and
interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan, which interpretation or construction shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties, including but not
limited to the Company and any Participant or Beneficiary, except as otherwise provided by law. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6, the Committee
delegates the authority to adjudicate claims to the Pension -Plans Administrative Committee.
2. Delegation and Reliance. The Committee may delegate to the officers or employees of the Company the authority to execute and deliver those
instruments and documents, to do all acts and things, and to take all other steps deemed necessary, advisable or convenient for the effective administration of
this Plan in accordance with its terms and purpose. In making any determination or in taking or not taking any action under this Plan, the Committee or its
delegate may obtain and rely upon the advice of experts, including professional advisors to the Company. No member of the Committee or officer of the
Company who is a Participant hereunder may participate in any decision specifically relating to his or her individual rights or benefits under the Plan.
3. Exculpation and Indemnity. Neither the Company nor any member of the Board or of the Committee, nor any other person participating in any
determination of any question under this Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, shall have any liability to any party for any action
taken or not taken in good faith under this Plan or for the failure of the Plan or any Participant’s rights under the Plan to achieve intended tax consequences, or
to comply with any other law, compliance with which is not required on the part of the Company.
4. Facility of Payment. If a minor, person declared incompetent, or person incapable of handling the disposition of his or her property is entitled to
receive a benefit, make an application, or make an election hereunder, the Committee or the Claims Administrator may direct that such benefits be paid to, or
such application or election be made by, the guardian, legal representative, or person having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent, or incapable
person. Any payment made, application allowed, or election implemented in accordance with this Section shall completely discharge the Company and the
Committee (or the Claims Administrator) from all liability with respect thereto.

5. Proof of Claims. The Pension Plans Administrative Committee may require proof of the death, disability, incompetency, minority, or incapacity of
any Participant or Beneficiary and of the right of a person to receive any benefit or make any application or election.
6. Claim Procedures. The procedures when a claim under this Plan is wholly or partially denied by the Claims Administrator are as follows:
 
 (a)The Claims Administrator shall, within 90 days after receipt of a claim, furnish to claimant a written notice setting forth, in a manner calculated
to be understood by claimant: (1) the specific reason or reasons for the denial; (2) specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the
denial is based; (3) a description of any additional materials or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of
why such material or information is necessary; (4) an explanation of the steps to be taken if the claimant wishes to have the denial reviewed; and
(5) a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse determination on review. The 90
day period may be extended for not more than an additional 90 days if special circumstances make such an extension necessary. The Claims
Administrator shall give the claimant, before the end of the initial 90 day period, a written notice of such extension, stating such special
circumstances and the date by which the Claims Administrator expects to render a decision.

FOR CERTAIN TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES
OF LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION
(Restated through July 1, 2015)
 
EXECUTION COPY
ARTICLE I
PURPOSES OF THE PLAN
The purposes of the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan for Certain Transferred Employees of Lockheed Martin Corporation (the “Plan”) are:
 
 (a)to provide an additional retirement benefit for certain employees whose regular retirement benefits have been limited as a result of employment
service at a Lockheed Martin company that does not have a Qualified Pension Plan; and
 
 (b)to provide an additional retirement benefit for certain employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 (January 1, 2007 for KAPL, Inc.) at a
Lockheed Martin company that has a Qualified Pension Plan that is frozen to new participants as of such date; and
 
 (c)to provide the above employees with those benefits that cannot be paid from the tax-qualified plans of Lockheed Martin Corporation and its
subsidiaries because of the limitations on contributions and benefits contained in Internal Revenue Code sections 415 and 401(a)(17).
The following plans and predecessor plans were amended, restated and merged to form this Plan, effective July 1, 2004:
 
 1. Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan for Certain Transferred Employees of Lockheed Martin Corporation (formerly known as the Supplemental
Retirement Benefit Plan for Certain Transferred Employees of Lockheed Corporation)
 
 2. Incentive Retirement Benefit Plan for Certain Executives of Lockheed Martin Corporation (formerly known as the Incentive Retirement Benefit
Plan for Certain Executives of Lockheed Corporation)
The Plan was amended and restated, effective January 1, 2005, in order to comply with the requirements of Code section 409A. The 2005 amendment
and restatement of the Plan applied only to the portion of a Participant’s benefit that accrued on or after January 1, 2005. The portion of a Participant’s benefit
that accrued prior to January 1, 2005 shall be governed by the terms of the Plan in effect on December 31, 2004, attached as Appendix A. The Plan was
amended and restated, effective June 26, 2008, in order to clarify certain provisions in accordance with the final Treasury Regulations issued under Code
section 409A and to make other clarifications with respect to eligibility and benefits. The Plan was amended and restated effective December 31, 2008 to
order to make further clarifications in accordance with the final Treasury Regulations issued under Code section 409A and to make other administrative
clarifications. The Plan was amended and restated effective December 31, 2010 to order to make further clarifications in accordance with the final Treasury
Regulations issued under Code section 409A and to make other administrative clarifications.
 
EXECUTION COPY
On June 26, 2014, the Qualified Pension Plan was amended: (i) effective January 1, 2016, to provide that pensionable earnings under the Qualified
Pension Plan shall not include amounts earned for or relating to any period after December 31, 2015; and (2) effective January 1, 2020, to freeze credited
service under the Qualified Pension Plan and to provide that no Qualified Pension Plan participant shall accrue credited service with respect to any period
after December 31, 2019. Effective July 1, 2014, the Plan was amended and restated to confirm these Qualified Pension Plan amendments shall carry through
to any applicable provision in this Plan, including all Annexes and Appendices to the Plan. Accordingly, base rate of pay, bonuses or other incentive
compensation, or other amounts earned for or relating to the period after December 31, 2015 shall not be used in determining benefits under the Plan, and
service after December 31, 2019 shall not be considered, deemed to be, or otherwise treated as Credited Service or similar benefit accrual service in
determining benefits payable under the Plan. Furthermore, the Plan was amended and restated to close the Plan to new entrants effective July 1, 2014.
The Plan is hereby amended and restated, effective for terminations from active service and pre-retirement deaths on or after July 1, 2015, to update the
mortality table used for determining the present value of benefits accrued under the Plan after December 31, 2004 when an individual is eligible for a lump
sum payout of such benefits and for certain benefit conversions involving benefits accrued under the Plan after December 31, 2004, from the 1983 Group
Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction to the mortality table approved by the Internal Revenue Service for calculating the present value of benefits for
determining lump sums payable under Code section 417(e)(3); provided, however, the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction will be used
instead of the Code section 417(e) applicable mortality table when use of the Code section 417(e)(3) applicable mortality table would cause a reduction in the
amount of benefits payable under the Plan.

distinction; provided that for Years beginning on or after January 1, 2011, in no event shall the interest rate plus 1% exceed 7% or be less than
4%. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective for terminations from active service and pre-retirement deaths on or after July 1, 2015, the

(3); provided that (i) in no event shall the interest rate plus 1% exceed 7% or be less than 4%, and (ii) if use of the applicable mortality table
under Code section 417(e)(3) results in any Participant’s or Surviving Spouse’s benefit under the Plan having an Actuarial Equivalent that is less
than the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s or Surviving Spouse’s benefit computed using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex
distinction, as determined at the time benefits become payable pursuant to Article V, then the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s or
Surviving Spouse’s Plan benefit will be computed using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction.

ARTICLE III
TRANSFER BENEFITS
1. Eligibility. Benefits pursuant to this Article III are available to employees of the Company who:
 
 (a)are Members of the Qualified Pension Plan, and
 
 (i) are transferred, prior to July 1, 2014 to a Participating Company that does not have a Qualified Pension Plan, and
 
 (ii) are identified by such Participating Company as a key employee at the time of such transfer, and
 
 (iii) are designated in writing, prior to July 1, 2014, by the Committee as a Participant in this Plan;
 
 (b)effective January 1, 2006 (January 1, 2007 for KAPL, Inc.), are not Members of the Qualified Pension Plan, and
 
 (i) are hired by a Participating Company on or after January 1, 2006 (or by KAPL, Inc. on or after January 1, 2007) and before July 1, 2014,
and
 
 (ii) are Vice Presidents (Level 8) or above on their date of hire, or are promoted to Vice President (Level 8) after their date of hire and before
July 1, 2014, and
 
 (iii) are not hired by a Participating Company pursuant to the Company’s acquisition of an entity that does not sponsor a qualified defined
benefit pension plan.
A “Participating Company” is a business unit designated in writing by the Committee as a unit participating in this Plan. A list of Participating
Units is set forth in Schedule 1.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no employee of the Company shall become a Participant in the Plan on or after July 1, 2014.
2. Amount of Benefit. The benefit that each Participant shall be entitled to receive under the Plan is the amount reasonably determined by the Company
to be the difference between the Participant’s actual benefit, if any, under the Qualified Pension Plan and the benefits that would have been payable under that
Plan, subject to the offset below, if:
 
 (a)the Qualified Pension Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below;
 (b)the Participant’s period of employment service as a Participant at a Participating Company at which no Credited Service is earned was deemed to
be years of Credited Service under the Qualified Pension Plan; and
 
 (c)the Participant’s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable earnings under the
Qualified Pension Plan, the Participant’s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match” basis. The Participant’s annual compensation
earned under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable earnings. The average of the three (3) highest years of MICP
compensation during the last 10 years shall be added to the average of the three (3) highest years of other pensionable earnings during the last 10 years to
arrive at total final average pensionable earnings for the applicable period under the Qualified Pension Plan.
The above benefit (the “Transfer Benefit”) shall be offset by the benefits payable on behalf of the Participant under the Lockheed Martin
Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan (the “Lockheed Martin CAP”) and under the Lockheed Martin Account Balance Retirement Plan (“ABRP”). In
calculating the offset, the Participant’s total account balance from the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be converted into an annuity using the 1983 Group Annuity
Mortality Table and shall be calculated as of the Participant’s termination of employment, using the PBGC immediate interest rate for lump sums rate plus 1%
and the Participant’s age on the date of distribution. If the Participant received any prior distributions from the Lockheed Martin CAP, the Transfer Benefit
shall be reduced by the annuity value of the prior distribution, using the Lockheed Martin CAP distribution amount, the PBGC interest rate plus 1% and
Participant’s age on the date of distribution. The Transfer Benefit is then reduced for the amount of the normal retirement benefit from the ABRP.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective for terminations from active service and pre-retirement deaths on or after July 1, 2015, the offset and prior
distribution reduction described above each shall be converted into an annuity using the applicable mortality table under Code section 417(e)(3); provided that
if use of the applicable mortality table under Code section 417(e)(3) results in an annuity that is more than the annuity calculated using the 1983 Group
Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction, as determined at the time benefits become payable pursuant to Article V, then the annuity shall be calculated
using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction.
Combined benefits under this Article III, the Lockheed Martin CAP and the ABRP are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit
under the Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the Qualified Pension
Plan on a “mix and match” basis, without regard to the limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), and with the special adjustments
described above. To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced Transfer Benefit described above shall
be calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified Pension Plan
(without regard to the portion of such benefit attributable to employee contributions, if any), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin
CAP and ABRP, and then reduced by the 2004 Grandfathered Benefit, to the extent permissible under Code section 409A. The remainder of the benefit shall
be paid from this Plan. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make such
adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article III shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who is receiving or entitled to
receive benefits with respect to the Participant under the Qualified Pension Plan.
If the benefits payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’s retirement as a result of a
general increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan.
3. Plan Freeze
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, base rate of pay, bonuses or other incentive compensation, or other amounts earned for or relating to the
period after December 31, 2015 shall not be used in determining the Transfer Benefit or other benefits under the Plan, and service after December 31, 2019
shall not be considered, deemed to be, or otherwise be treated as Credited Service or similar benefit accrual service in determining benefits payable under the
Plan.
ARTICLE IV
INCENTIVE BENEFITS
1. Eligibility. Benefits pursuant to this Article IV are available to the employees described below. However, an employee who terminated employment
with Lockheed Corporation prior to January 1, 1984, when eligible for a deferred retirement benefit under Section 5.03 of the Lockheed Retirement Plan for
Certain Salaried Employees is not eligible to receive a benefit under this Article IV.
An employee or former employee of Lockheed Martin Corporation and its subsidiaries who, prior to July 2, 2014:
 (a)is employed by a Lockheed Martin business unit that is not covered by a Qualified Pension Plan, and
 
 (b)is identified by such business unit as a key employee, and
 
 (c)at the time of eligibility for benefits is, or for any year during his or her last ten (10) years of service]with Lockheed Martin Corporation prior to
July 1, 2014 was, a participant in the Lockheed Martin Corporation Management Incentive Compensation Plan (including the Deferred
Management Incentive Compensation Plan of Lockheed Martin Corporation), or any incentive compensation plan of any subsidiary or affiliated
corporation of Lockheed Martin Corporation which the Committee determines is a corresponding incentive plan; and
 
 (d)who has been specifically designated in writing before July 1, 2014 by the Committee as a Participant; and
 
 (e)who is not eligible for a benefit under Article III of this Plan
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no employee of the Company shall become a Participant in the Plan on or after July 1, 2014.
 
 2. Amount of Benefit.
A. Normal or Disability Retirement. The benefit payable under this Article IV to a Participant is the amount reasonably determined to be the
difference between the Participant’s actual benefit under the Lockheed Martin Retirement Plan for Certain Salaried Employees (or such other Qualified
Pension Plan as designated by the Committee (the “Designated Qualified Plan”) and the benefits that would have been payable under that Plan, subject to the
offset below, if:
 
 (a)the Designated Qualified Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below;
 
 (b)the Participant’s period of employment service as a Participant with the Company during which period no Credited Service is earned either
because the Participant was not in a covered group or because of a limitation on Credited Service under the Qualified Pension, was deemed to be
years of Credited Service under the Designated Qualified Pension Plan; and
 
 (c)the Participant’s benefit under the Designated Qualified Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable earnings under the
Qualified Pension Plan, the Participant’s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match” basis. The Participant’s annual compensation
earned under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable earnings. The average of the highest years of MICP compensation shall
be added to the average of the highest years of other pensionable earnings to arrive at total final average pensionable earnings for the applicable period under
the Qualified Pension Plan.
The above benefit (the “Incentive Benefit”) shall be offset by the benefits payable on behalf of the Participant under the Lockheed Martin
Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan (the “Lockheed Martin CAP”) and under the Lockheed Martin Account Balance Retirement Plan (“ABRP”). In
calculating the offset, the Participant’s total account balance from the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be converted into an annuity using the 1983 Group Annuity
Mortality Table and shall be calculated as of the Participant’s termination of employment, using the PBGC immediate interest rate for lump sums rate plus 1%
and Participant’s age on the date of distribution. If the Participant received any prior distributions from the Lockheed Martin CAP, the Incentive Benefit shall
be reduced by the annuity value of the prior distribution, using the Lockheed Martin CAP distribution amount, PBGC immediate interest rate for lump sums
rate plus 1% and Participant’s age on the date of distribution. The Incentive Benefit is then reduced for the amount of the Participant’s normal retirement
benefit from the ABRP, and then reduced by the Participant’s 2004 Grandfathered Benefit, to the extent permissible under Code section 409A.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective for terminations from active service and pre-retirement deaths on or after July 1, 2015, the offset and prior
distribution reduction described above each shall be converted into an annuity using the applicable mortality table under Code section 417(e)(3); provided that
if use of the applicable mortality table under Code section 417(e)(3) results in an annuity that is more than the annuity calculated using the 1983 Group
Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction, as determined at the time benefits become payable pursuant to Article V, then the annuity shall be calculated
using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction.
C. No Duplication. Combined benefits under this Article IV, the Lockheed Martin CAP and the ABRP are intended to supplement the Participant’s
actual benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the
Qualified Pension Plan on a “mix and match” basis, without regard to the limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), and with the special
adjustments described above. To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced Incentive Benefit
described above shall be calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the
Qualified Pension Plan then reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin CAP and ABRP, and then reduced by the Participant’s 2004
Grandfathered Benefit, to the extent permissible under Code section 409A. The remainder of the benefit shall be paid from this Plan. Participants have no
right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the
Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article IV shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who would be entitled to receive
benefits with respect to the Participant under the Designated Qualified Plan.
If the benefits that would be payable under the Designated Qualified Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’s retirement
as a result of a general increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan.
3. Plan Freeze
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, base rate of pay, bonuses or other incentive compensation, or other amounts earned for or
relating to the period after December 31, 2015 shall not be used in determining the Incentive Benefit or benefits under the Plan, and service after
December 31, 2019 shall not be considered, deemed to be, or otherwise treated as Credited Service or similar benefit accrual service in determining benefits
payable under this Plan.
ARTICLE V
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1. Vesting. Except as provided in Article VI, and subject to the Company’s right to discontinue the Plan as provided in Article VII, a Participant shall
have a non-forfeitable interest in benefits payable under this Plan to the same extent as benefits are vested under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan. As
provided in Article VI, if a Participant acquires a right to receive payments under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured
general creditor of the Company.
2. Form and Timing of Payment. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Participant may make an initial payment election between an annuity and a
lump sum payment under the terms and conditions described in this Section 2. All elections under this Section 2 must be made in the form and manner
prescribed by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources. No election made pursuant to this Section 2 may affect a payment due in the same calendar year
in which the election is made or accelerate payment into the calendar year in which the election is made.
(a) Regular Form. Unless a Participant has elected a lump sum payment under Section 2(b) of this Article V, benefits under this Plan shall be paid
in the form of
an annuity. Participants who first become eligible for participation in the Plan after December 16, 2005 shall receive their benefits in the form of an
annuity. Benefits paid in a form described in this Section 2(a) shall commence as soon as administratively practicable (but no more than 90 days)
following the later of (i) the month in which the Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age
fifty-five (55). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, benefits paid in a form described in this Section 2(a) to a Participant who is reasonably
determined by the Company to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code section 409A(2)(B)(i), shall not commence before the later of
(i) six (6) months following the month in which the Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age
fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the
payment date.
i. Selection of Annuity Form. Prior to his Termination of Employment or attainment of age 55, as applicable, a Participant may elect to receive
benefits in any actuarially equivalent annuity form that is available under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan on the date of the Participant’s election
that has been designated by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources as available for election under this Plan. If the Participant has not validly
elected an annuity form before his Termination of Employment or attainment of age 55, as applicable, under this Section 2(a) or a lump sum payment
as provided in Section 2(b) of Article V, (i) an unmarried Participant shall be deemed to have elected payment in the form of a monthly annuity for the
life of the Participant with no further payments to anyone after his or her death, and (ii) a married Participant shall be deemed to have elected payment
in the form of a reduced monthly annuity for the life of the Participant with, after the Participant’s death, a 50% survivor annuity for the life of the
Participant’s spouse. Actuarial adjustments shall be based on the factors set forth in the Qualified Pension Plan.
(b) Lump Sum Option. This Section shall not apply to Participants who first become eligible for participation in the Plan after December 16,
2005. In lieu of the forms described in Section 2(a) of Article V, a Participant may make a one-time initial election to receive a full lump sum payment
in an amount which is the Actuarial Equivalent of a monthly annuity for the life of the Participant with no further payments to anyone after his or her
death, provided the election is filed with the Company in writing no later than December 31, 2008 (or such other date determined by the Senior Vice
President, Human Resources and communicated to Participants) and the Participant’s employment has not terminated employment prior to filing the
election. For all Participants who elect a lump sum under this Section 2(b), the lump sum payment shall be made six (6) months following the later of
(i) the month in which the Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No
interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of Employment or
attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date. All elections under this Section (b) must be made in the form and manner
prescribed by the Company. Such election shall be irrevocable except as provided in Section 2(e) of Article V.
(c) Cash-out of Small Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, if the Value of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary under
this Plan does not exceed $10,000, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum payment in full discharge of all liabilities with respect to such
benefits. For purposes of this Section, Value shall be determined as of the Participant’s Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55),
as applicable, and shall mean the present value of a Participant’s or Beneficiary’s benefits, excluding the Grandfathered 2004 Benefit, based (i) for
terminations prior to January 1, 2008 upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate in Code section 417(e)(3)(ii), or for Terminations
of Employment on or after January 1, 2008, upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate under Code section 417(e)(3), as amended
by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, for the calendar month preceding the Plan Year in which the Termination of Employment or attainment of age
fifty-five (55) occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, benefits paid under this Section 2.c. to a Participant who is reasonably determined by
the Company to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code section 409A(2)(B)(i), shall not commence before six (6) months following the
later of (i) the month in which the Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No
interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date.
(d) Payment Upon Death or Disability.
i. Death. No other death benefits are provided under this Plan other than as specified in this Section 2.d.i.
A. Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit. In the event the Participant dies prior to Termination of Employment or the attainment of age
fifty-five (55), a pre-retirement survivor benefit will be payable to the Participant’s surviving spouse (if any) (the “Pre-Retirement
Survivor Benefit” and the “Surviving Spouse”) in the form elected by the Participant under the terms of the Plan. If the Participant’s
benefit was payable in a lump sum, the lump sum shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of a monthly annuity payable for the life of the
Surviving Spouse with no further payments to anyone after his or her death. The Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit shall commence as
soon as administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days) following the later of (i) the
month in which the Participant dies, or (ii) the month in which the Participant would have attained age fifty-five (55). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to all Participants who validly elected a lump sum under Section 2.b., a lump sum Pre-Retirement Survivor
Benefit shall be paid to the Participant’s Surviving Spouse six (6) months following the later of (i) the month in which the Participant
dies, or (ii) the month in which the Participant would have attained age fifty-five (55). No Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit is payable to
anyone other than the Participant’s Surviving Spouse.
B. Death After Termination of Employment or Attainment of Age 55. If a Participant who is required to wait six (6) months for a
lump sum payment (in accordance with Section 2 of Article V) dies after the Participant’s Termination of Employment or attainment of
age fifty-five (55), as applicable, but before payment is made, the lump sum payment shall be made to the Participant’s Beneficiary as
administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days) following the death of the Participant.
ii. Disability. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article V, the benefit of a Disabled Participant who is eligible for a disability pension
from the Lockheed Martin Retirement Income Plan or the Lockheed Martin Corporation Retirement Income Plan III shall be paid in the form
elected by the Participant under the terms of the Plan as soon as administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days) following the date the
Participant is reasonably determined by the Company to be Disabled. For the purposes of this Section 2.d.ii., the terms “Disabled” or “Disability”
shall have the meaning set forth in the Lockheed Martin Retirement Income Plan or the Lockheed Martin Corporation Retirement Income Plan
III, as applicable, to the extent consistent with the requirements of Code section 409A(a)(2(C).
(e) Prospective Change of Payment Elections. Participants may elect to change the form of payment of benefits or further delay the commencement of
benefits as provided in this Section 2(e). All elections under this Section 2(e) must be made in the form and manner prescribed by the Company. This
Section 2(e) does not apply to Surviving Spouses or Beneficiaries. Subject to the provisions of Code section 409A, other changes in the form of benefit,
including changes between actuarially equivalent forms of benefit, if any, may be made only as determined by the Senior Vice President, Human
Resources, of the Company in accordance with Code section 409A.
 i. Form of Payment. A Participant who has validly elected (or deemed to have elected) payment as an annuity (as described in Section 2(a)
of Article V) or has validly elected a lump sum payment (in accordance with Section 2(b) of Article V) may later elect to receive
payment in any form (annuity or lump sum) designated by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, of the Company, provided that
such election is made in the form and manner determined by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources not less than twelve
(12) months before the date the payment would have first commenced under the Participant’s prior election. In addition, the first payment
under the new election must commence no earlier than sixty (60) months from the date when the payment would have first commenced
under the Participant’s prior election. Such change in election shall not be given effect until twelve (12) months from the date that the
change in election is delivered to the Company.
 
 j. ii. Timing of Payment. Regardless of the form of payment, a Participant may elect to delay payment of his benefit provided such election
is made in writing in the form and manner determined by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, not less than twelve (12) months
before the date the payment would have first commenced under the Participant’s prior election. In addition, the first payment under the
new election must commence no earlier than sixty (60) months from when the payment would have first commenced under the
Participant’s prior election. No interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55),
as applicable, and the payment date. Such change in election shall not be given effect until twelve (12) months from the date that the
change in election is delivered to the Company.
f. Notwithstanding the above, for periods prior to January 1, 2009, (or such later date as may be provided by the Internal Revenue Service in guidance
of general applicability), the Senior Vice President, Human Resources may provide alternative rules for elections with respect to the commencement of
payment and form of payment, provided that such rules conform to Code section 409A and Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder.
g. If a Participant participates in more than one supplemental pension plan sponsored by the Corporation, the Participant must make a single election
that shall apply to his or her benefits under all such plans with respect to the form of annuity (under Section 2(a) of this Article 5) and with respect to
prospective changes of payment (under Section 2(e) of this Article 5).
3. Deductibility of Payments. Subject to the provisions of Section Code section 409A, in the event that the Company reasonably anticipates that the
payment of benefits in accordance with the Participant’s election under Section 2 would prevent the Company from claiming an income tax deduction with
respect to any portion of the benefits paid under Code
section 162(m), the Committee shall have the right to delay the timing of distributions from the Participant’s Account as necessary to maximize the
Company’s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a delayed distribution schedule, the Committee shall undertake to have distributions made
at such times and in such amounts as the Company reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year, the
deduction will not be barred by Code section 162(m) or upon a Termination of Employment in accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-2(b)(7)
(i), consistent with the objective of maximum deductibility for the Company. The Committee shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’s Account
Balance or to pay aggregate benefits less than the Participant’s Account Balance in the event that all or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the
Company. All scheduled payments under this Plan and any other plan required to be aggregated with this Plan must be delayed in order for such payment to
be delayed pursuant to this Section 8.
4. Change of Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Committee determines in good faith, based on consultation with counsel and
in accordance with the requirements of Code section 409A, that the federal income tax treatment or legal status of this Plan has or may be adversely affected
by a change in the Code, Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or other applicable law or by an administrative or judicial
construction thereof, the Committee may direct that the benefits of affected Participants or of all Participants be distributed as soon as practicable after such
determination is made, to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by the Committee to cure or mitigate the consequences, or possible consequences of, such
change in law or interpretation thereof.
5. Acceleration upon Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the accrued benefit of each Participant shall be one-hundred
percent (100%) vested and be distributed in a single lump sum within fifteen (15) calendar days following a “Change in Control.”
For purposes of this Plan, a Change in Control shall include and be deemed to occur upon the following events:
 
 (a)A tender offer or exchange offer is consummated for the ownership of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined
voting power of the Company’s then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
 
 (b)The Company is merged, combined, consolidated, recapitalized or otherwise reorganized with one or more other entities that are not Company
Subsidiaries and, as a result of the merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization or other reorganization, less than 75% of the outstanding
voting securities of the surviving or resulting corporation shall immediately after the event be owned in the aggregate by the stockholders of the
Company (directly or indirectly),
 determined on the basis of record ownership as of the date of determination of holders entitled to vote on the action (or in the absence of a vote,
the day immediately prior to the event).
 
 (c)Any person (as this term is used in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, but excluding any person described in and satisfying the
conditions of Rule 13d-1(b)(1) thereunder), becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities
entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
 
 (d)At any time within any period of two years after a tender offer, merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization, or other reorganization or a
contested election, or any combination of these events, the “Incumbent Directors” shall cease to constitute at least a majority of the authorized
number of members of the Board. For purposes hereof, “Incumbent Directors” shall mean the persons who were members of the Board
immediately before the first of these events and the persons who were elected or nominated as their successors or pursuant to increases in the size
of the Board by a vote of at least three-fourths of the Board members who were then Board members (or successors or additional members so
elected or nominated).
 
 (e)The stockholders of the Company approve a plan of liquidation and dissolution or the sale or transfer of substantially all of the Company’s
business and/or assets as an entirety to an entity that is not a Company Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no distribution shall be made solely on account of a Change in Control and prior to the benefit commencement
date specified in Section 2 of Article V unless the Change in Control is both an event qualifying for a distribution of deferred compensation under
Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code and an event qualifying under this Section 5.
This Section 5 shall apply only to a Change in Control of Lockheed Martin Corporation and shall not cause immediate payout of benefits under
this Plan in any transaction involving the Company’s sale, liquidation, merger, or other disposition of any subsidiary.
The Committee may cancel or modify this Section 5 at any time prior to a Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, this Section 5
shall remain in force and effect, and shall not be subject to cancellation or modification for a period of five years, and any defined term used in Section 5 shall
not, for purposes of Section 5, be subject to cancellation or modification during the five year period
6. Tax Withholding. To the extent required by law, the Company shall withhold from benefit payments hereunder any Federal, state, or local income or
payroll taxes required to be withheld and shall furnish the recipient and the applicable government agency or agencies with such reports, statements, or
information as may be legally required. No benefit payments shall be made to the Participant until the withholding obligation for taxes under Code sections
3101(a) and 3101(b) has been satisfied with respect to the Participant.
7. Retiree Medical Withholding. A Participant may direct the Company to withhold from the Participant’s benefit payments hereunder all or a portion
of the amount that the Participant is required to pay for Company-provided retiree medical coverage.
8. Reemployment. The retirement benefit otherwise payable hereunder to any Participant who previously retired or otherwise had a Termination of
Employment and is subsequently reemployed may not be suspended during the Participant’s period of reemployment except as permitted under Code section
409A.
9. Mistaken Payments. No Participant or Beneficiary shall have any right to any payment made (1) in error, (2) in contravention to the terms of the
Plan, the Code, or ERISA, or (3) because the Committee or its delegates were not informed of any death. The Committee shall have full rights under the law
and ERISA to recover any such mistaken payment, and the right to recover attorney’s fees and other costs incurred with respect to such recovery. Recovery
shall be made from future Plan payments, or by any other available means.
ARTICLE VI
EXTENT OF PARTICIPANTS’ RIGHTS
1. Unfunded Status of Plan. This Plan constitutes a mere contractual promise by the Company to make payments in the future, and each Participant’s
rights shall be those of a general, unsecured creditor of the Company. No Participant shall have any beneficial interest in any specific assets that the Company
may hold or set aside in connection with this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to assist the Company in meeting its obligations under this Plan, the
Company may set aside assets in a trust or trusts described in Revenue Procedure 92-64, 1992-2 C.B. 422, and the Company may direct that its obligations
under this Plan be satisfied by payments out of such trust or trusts. The assets of any such trust will remain subject to the claims of the general creditors of the
Company. It is the Company’s intention that the Plan be unfunded for Federal income tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974.
2. Nonalienability of Benefits. A Participant’s rights under this Plan shall not be assignable or transferable and any purported transfer, assignment,
pledge or other encumbrance
or attachment of any payments or benefits under this Plan, or any interest therein shall not be permitted or recognized, other than the designation of, or
passage of payment rights to, a Beneficiary or transfer of an interest in this Plan to a Participant’s spouse, former spouse, or child incident to divorce under a
Qualified Domestic Relations Order (which shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with Code sections 414(p)(1)(B) and 409A), provided that the
form of payment designated in such order is an annuity as provided in Section 2(a) of Article V.
3. Forfeiture. If, following the date on which a Participant shall retire under this Plan, a Participant shall engage in the operation or management of a
business, whether as owner, stockholder, partner, officer, employee, consultant, or otherwise, which at such time is in competition with the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, or shall disclose to unauthorized persons information relative to the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which the Participant
shall have reason to believe is confidential, or otherwise act, or conduct oneself, in a manner which the Participant shall have reason to believe is contrary to
the best interest of the Company, or shall be found by the Committee to have committed an act during the term of the Participant’s employment which would
have justified the Participant being discharged for cause, the Participant’s retirement benefit under this Plan shall terminate. Application of this Section will
be at the discretion of the Committee.
ARTICLE VII
AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION
1. Amendment. The Board or its authorized delegate may amend, modify, suspend or discontinue this Plan at any time subject to any shareholder
approval that may be required under applicable law, provided, however, that no such amendment shall have the effect of reducing a Participant’s accrued
benefit or postponing the time when a Participant is entitled to receive a distribution of his accrued benefit unless each affected Participant consents to such
change.
2. Termination. The Board reserves the right to terminate this Plan at any time and at such times that the Board reasonably determines in its discretion is
appropriate and conforms to the requirements of Code section 409A, to pay all Participants their accrued benefits in a lump sum or to make other provisions
for the payment of benefits (e.g. purchase of annuities) immediately following such termination or at such time thereafter as the Board may determine.
3. Transfer of Liability. The Board reserves the right to transfer to another entity all of the obligations of Company with respect to a Participant under
this Plan if such entity agrees pursuant to a binding written agreement with the Company or its subsidiaries to assume all of the obligations of the Company
under this Plan with respect to such Participant.
4. Merger. The Board reserves the right to merge all or part of this Plan with or into another plan, provided (1) such other plan preserves all of the
obligations of the Company under this Plan with respect to such Participant and (2) each Participant in the Plan would (if the Plan then terminated) receive a
benefit immediately after the merger which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger (if the
Plan had then terminated).
ARTICLE VIII
ADMINISTRATION
1. The Committee. This Plan shall be administered by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board or such other
committee of the Board as may be designated by the Board. The members of the Committee shall be designated by the Board. A majority of the members of
the Committee (but not fewer than two) shall constitute a quorum. The vote of a majority of a quorum or the unanimous written consent of the Committee
shall constitute action by the Committee. The Committee and its delegates (including the Claims Administrator) shall have full discretion to construe and
interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan, which interpretation or construction shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties, including but not
limited to the Company and any Participant or Beneficiary, except as otherwise provided by law. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan or in any
document issued under the Plan, it is intended that the Plan will at all times conform to the requirements of Code section 409A and any regulations or other
guidance issued thereunder, and that the provisions of the Plan will be interpreted to meet such requirements. If any provision of the Plan is determined not to
conform to such requirements, the Plan shall be interpreted to omit such offending provision.
2. Delegation and Reliance. The Committee may delegate to the officers or employees of the Company the authority to execute and deliver those
instruments and documents, to do all acts and things, and to take all other steps deemed necessary, advisable or convenient for the effective administration of
this Plan in accordance with its terms and purpose. In making any determination or in taking or not taking any action under this Plan, the Committee or its
delegate may obtain and rely upon the advice of experts, including professional advisors to the Company. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6, the
Committee delegates the authority to adjudicate claims to the Pension Plans Administrative Committee. No member of the Committee or officer of the
Company who is a Participant hereunder may participate in any decision specifically relating to his or her individual rights or benefits under the Plan.
3. Exculpation and Indemnity. Neither the Company nor any member of the Board or of the Committee, nor any other person participating in any
determination of any question under this Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, shall have any liability to any party for any action
taken or not taken in good faith under this Plan or for the
failure of the Plan or any Participant’s rights under the Plan to achieve intended tax consequences, or to comply with any other law, compliance with which is
not required on the part of the Company.
4. Facility of Payment. If a minor, person declared incompetent, or person incapable of handling the disposition of his or her property is entitled to
receive a benefit, make an application, or make an election hereunder, the Committee or the Claims Administrator may direct that such benefits be paid to, or
such application or election be made by, the guardian, legal representative, or person having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent, or incapable
person. Any payment made, application allowed, or election implemented in accordance with this Section shall completely discharge the Company and the
Committee (or Claims Administrator) from all liability with respect thereto.
5. Proof of Claims. The Committee or Claims Administrator may require proof of the death, disability, incompetency, minority, or incapacity of any
Participant or Beneficiary and of the right of a person to receive any benefit or make any application or election.
6. Claim Procedures. The procedures when a claim under this Plan is wholly or partially denied by the Claims Administrator are as follows:
 
 (a)The Claims Administrator shall, within 90 days after receipt of a claim, furnish to claimant a written notice setting forth, in a manner calculated
to be understood by claimant: (1) the specific reason or reasons for the denial; (2) specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the
denial is based; (3) a description of any additional materials or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of
why such material or information is necessary; (4) an explanation of the steps to be taken if the claimant wishes to have the denial reviewed; and
(5) a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse determination on review. The 90
day period may be extended for not more than an additional 90 days if special circumstances make such an extension necessary. The Claims
Administrator shall give the claimant, before the end of the initial 90 day period, a written notice of such extension, stating such special
circumstances and the date by which the Claims Administrator expects to render a decision.
 
 (b)By a written application filed with the Claims Administrator within 60 days after receipt by claimant of the written notice described in paragraph
(a), the claimant or his duly authorized representative may request review of the denial of his claim.
 (c)In connection with such review, the claimant or his duly authorized representative may submit issues, comments, documents, records and other
information relating to the claim for benefits to the Claims Administrator. In addition, the claimant will be provided, upon request and free of
charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, or other information “relevant” to claimant’s claim for benefits. A document,
record, or other information is “relevant” if it: (1) was relied upon in making the benefit determination; (2) was submitted, considered or
generated in the course of making the benefit determination, without regard to whether such document, record or information was relied upon in
making the benefit determination; or (3) demonstrates compliance with administrative processes and safeguards required under Federal law.
 
 (d)The Plan will provide an impartial review that takes into account all comments, records and other information submitted by the claimant relating
to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The Claims
Administrator shall make a decision and furnish such decision in writing to the claimant within 60 days after receipt by the Claims Administrator
of the request for review. This period may be extended to not more than 120 days after such receipt if special circumstances make such an
extension necessary. The claimant will be notified in writing prior to the expiration of the original 60 day period if such an extension is required,
and such notice will include the reason for the extension and the date by which it is expected that a decision will be reached. The decision on
review shall be in writing, set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include: (1) the specific reasons for the
decision; (2) specific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based; (3) a statement that the claimant is entitled to
receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, and other information “relevant” to the
claimant’s claim for benefits; (4) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an
explanation of why such material or information is necessary; (5) a statement describing any voluntary appeal procedures and the claimant’s right
to obtain information about such procedures, if any; and (6) a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of
ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review. If in the event that the reviewing committee must make a determination of
disability in order to decide a claim, the reviewing committee shall follow the special claims procedures for disability benefits described in
Department of Labor Regulation section 2560.503-1(d). The reviewing committee shall render a decision within a reasonable time (not to exceed
90 days) after the claimant’s request for review, rather than within 120 days as set forth in the above paragraph.
 (e)The Claims Administrator shall be the Lockheed Martin Corporation Pension Plans Administrative Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
with respect to claims and appeals brought by elected officers of the Company, the Claims Administrator shall be the Committee.
ARTICLE IX

1. This Plan shall not in any way obligate the Company to continue the employment of a Participant with the Company, nor does this Plan limit the

of any nature whatsoever between the Company and a Participant. In no event shall this Plan by its terms or implications in any way limit the right of the
Company to change an Eligible Employee’s compensation or other benefits.

ARTICLE I
PURPOSES OF THE PLAN
The purposes of the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan for Certain Transferred Employees of Lockheed Martin Corporation (the “Plan”) are:
 
 (a)to provide an additional retirement benefit for certain employees whose regular retirement benefits have been limited as a result of employment
service at a Lockheed Martin company that does not have a Qualified Pension Plan; and
 
 (b)to provide the above employees with those benefits that cannot be paid from the tax-qualified plans of Lockheed Martin Corporation and its
subsidiaries because of the limitations on contributions and benefits contained in Internal Revenue Code sections 415 and 401(a)(17).
The following plans and predecessor plans are amended, restated and merged to form this Plan, effective July 1, 2004:
 
 3. Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan for Certain Transferred Employees of Lockheed Martin Corporation (formerly known as the Supplemental
Retirement Benefit Plan for Certain Transferred Employees of Lockheed Corporation)
 
 4. Incentive Retirement Benefit Plan for Certain Executives of Lockheed Martin Corporation (formerly known as the Incentive Retirement Benefit

ARTICLE III
TRANSFER BENEFITS
 
 1. Eligibility. Benefits pursuant to this Article III are available to employees of the Company who:
 
 (a)are Members of the Qualified Pension Plan, and
 
 (b)are transferred to a Participating Company that does not have a Qualified Pension Plan, and
 
 (c)are identified by such Participating Company as a key employee at the time of such transfer, and
 
 (d)are designated in writing by the Committee as a Participant in this Plan.
A “Participating Company” is a business unit designated in writing by the Committee as a unit participating in this Plan. A list of Participating Units is set
forth in Schedule 1.
2. Amount of Benefit. The benefit that each Participant shall be entitled to receive is the difference between the Participant’s actual benefit under the
Qualified Pension Plan and the benefits that would have been payable under that Plan, subject to the offset below, if:
 
 (a)the Qualified Pension Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below;
 
 (b)the Participant’s period of employment service as a Participant at a Participating Company at which no Credited Service is earned was deemed to
be years of Credited Service under the Qualified Pension Plan; and
 
 (c)the Participant’s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable earnings under the
Qualified Pension Plan, the
Participant’s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match” basis. The Participant’s annual compensation earned under the MICP shall
be calculated separately from other annual pensionable earnings. The average of the three (3) highest years of MICP compensation during the last 10 years
shall be added to the average of the three (3) highest years of other pensionable earnings during the last 10 years to arrive at total final average pensionable
earnings for the applicable period under the Qualified Pension Plan.
The above benefit (the “Transfer Benefit”) shall be offset by the benefits payable on behalf of the Participant under the Lockheed Martin
Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan (the “Lockheed Martin CAP”) and under the Lockheed Martin Account Balance Retirement Plan (“ABRP”). In
calculating the offset, the Participant’s total account balance from the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be converted into an annuity using the 1983 Group Annuity
Mortality Table for males and the PBGC interest rate. The benefits payable under the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be calculated as of the Participant’s
termination of employment, using the Actuarial Equivalent. If the Participant received any prior distributions from the Lockheed Martin CAP, the Transfer
Benefit shall be reduced by the annuity value of the prior distribution, using the Lockheed Martin CAP distribution amount, the PBGC interest rate plus 1%
and Participant’s age on the date of distribution. The Transfer Benefit is then reduced for the amount of the normal retirement benefit from the ABRP.
Combined benefits under this Article III, the Lockheed Martin CAP and the ABRP are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit
under the Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the Qualified Pension
Plan on a “mix and match” basis, without regard to the limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), and with the special adjustments
described above. To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced Transfer Benefit described above shall
be calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified Pension Plan, and
then reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin CAP and ABRP. The remainder of the benefit shall be paid from this Plan. Participants have
no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the
Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article III shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who is receiving or entitled to
receive benefits with respect to the Participant under the Qualified Pension Plan.
If the benefits payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’s retirement as a result of a
general increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan unless the Committee expressly so
provides in writing.
3. Plan Freeze
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, base rate of pay, bonuses or other incentive compensation, or other amounts earned for or relating to
the period after December 31, 2015 shall not be used in determining benefits under the Plan, and service after December 31, 2019 shall not be considered,
deemed to be, or otherwise treated as Credited Service or similar benefit accrual service in determining benefits payable under this Plan.
ARTICLE IV
INCENTIVE BENEFITS
1. Eligibility. Benefits pursuant to this Article IV are available to the employees described below. However, an employee who terminated employment
with Lockheed Corporation prior to January 1, 1984, when eligible for a deferred retirement benefit under Section 5.03 of the Lockheed Retirement Plan for
Certain Salaried Employees is not eligible to receive a benefit under this Article IV.
An employee or former employee of Lockheed Martin Corporation and its subsidiaries who:
 
 (a) is employed by a Lockheed Martin business unit that is not covered by a Qualified Pension Plan, and
 
 (b) is identified by such business unit as a key employee, and
 
 (c) at the time of eligibility for benefits is, or for any year during his or her last ten (10) years of service with Lockheed Martin Corporation
was, a participant in the Lockheed Martin Corporation Management Incentive Compensation Plan (including the Deferred Management
Incentive Compensation Plan of Lockheed Martin Corporation), or any incentive compensation plan of any subsidiary or affiliated
corporation of Lockheed Martin Corporation which the Committee determines is a corresponding incentive plan; and
 
 (d) who has been specifically designated in writing by the Committee as a Participant; and
 
 (e) who is not eligible for a benefit under Article III of this Plan.
2. Amount of Benefit.
A. Normal or Disability Retirement. The benefit payable under this Article IV to a Participant at normal retirement age is the difference between
the Participant’s actual benefit under the Lockheed Martin Retirement Plan for Certain Salaried Employees (or such other Qualified Pension Plan as
designated by the Committee (the “Designated Qualified Plan”) and the benefits that would have been payable under that Plan, subject to the offset below, if:
 
 (a)the Designated Qualified Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below;
 
 (b)the Participant’s period of employment service as a Participant with the Company at which no Credited Service is earned because the Participant
was not in a covered group or because of a limitation on Credited Service under the Qualified Pension Plan was deemed to be years of Credited
Service under the Designated Qualified Pension Plan; and
 
 (c)the Participant’s benefit under the Designated Qualified Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable earnings under the
Qualified Pension Plan, the Participant’s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match” basis. The Participant’s annual compensation
earned under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable earnings. The average of the highest years of MICP compensation shall
be added to the average of the highest years of other pensionable earnings to arrive at total final average pensionable earnings for the applicable period under
the Qualified Pension Plan.
The above benefit (the “Incentive Benefit”) shall be offset by the benefits payable on behalf of the Participant under the Lockheed Martin
Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan (the “Lockheed Martin CAP”) and under the Lockheed Martin Account Balance Retirement Plan (“ABRP”). In
calculating the offset, the Participant’s total account balance from the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be converted into an annuity using the 1983 Group Annuity
Mortality Table and the PBGC interest rate. The benefits payable under the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be calculated as of the Participant’s termination of
employment, using the Actuarial Equivalent. If the Participant received any prior distributions from the Lockheed Martin CAP, the Incentive Benefit shall be
reduced by the annuity value of the prior distribution, using the Lockheed Martin CAP distribution amount, PBGC immediate interest rate for lump sums rate
plus 1% and Participant’s age on the date of distribution. The Incentive Benefit is then reduced for the amount of the Participant’s normal retirement benefit
from the ABRP.
B. Early Retirement. The benefit payable under this Article IV to a Participant who satisfies the Designated Qualified Plan rules for early
retirement eligibility as set forth in Article IV of the Qualified Pension Plan or for a deferred monthly retirement benefit in accordance with the rules set forth
in Article VIII of the Qualified Pension Plan, whether or not such Participant is a member of the Qualified Pension Plan, shall be calculated in accordance
with the provisions of Article V of the Qualified Pension Plan, for early retirement, or Article VIII of the Qualified Pension Plan, for deferred retirement, as
applied to the benefit amount calculated in accordance with Paragraph A, above.
C. Pre-Retirement Surviving Spouse Benefit. If a Pre-retirement Surviving Spouse Benefit would have applied had the Participant been eligible
to participate in the Designated Qualified Plan, such survivor benefit shall automatically apply to any benefit which he or she may be eligible under this Plan.
The survivor benefit shall be adjusted and paid in the same manner as such pension payable under the Designated Qualified Plan would be adjusted and paid
on account of such survivor benefit.
Combined benefits under this Article IV, the Lockheed Martin CAP and the ABRP are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit
under the Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the Qualified Pension
Plan on a “mix and match” basis, without regard to the limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), and with the special adjustments
described above. To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced Incentive Benefit described above
shall be calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified Pension Plan,
and then reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin CAP and ABRP. The remainder of the benefit shall be paid from this Plan. Participants
have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as
the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article IV shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who would be entitled to receive
benefits with respect to the Participant under the Designated Qualified Plan.
If the benefits that would be payable under the Designated Qualified Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’s retirement
as a result of a general increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan unless the
Committee expressly so provides in writing.
3. Plan Freeze
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, base rate of pay, bonuses or other incentive compensation, or other amounts earned for or relating to
the period after December 31, 2015 shall not be used in determining the Incentive Benefit or benefits under the Plan, and service after December 31, 2019
shall not be considered, deemed to be, or otherwise treated as Credited Service or similar benefit accrual service in determining benefits payable under the
Plan.
ARTICLE V
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1. Vesting. Except as provided in Article VI, and subject to the Company’s right to discontinue the Plan as provided in Article VII, a Participant shall
have a non-forfeitable interest in benefits payable under this Plan to the same extent as benefits are vested under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan. As
provided in Article VI, if a Participant acquires a right to receive payments under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured
general creditor of the Company.
2. Form of Payment. Benefits shall be paid in the same form at the same times and for the same period as benefits are paid with respect to the
Participant under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan, except as provided in the following paragraphs. Actuarial adjustments shall be based on the factors
set forth in the Qualified Pension Plan, except as provided in the following paragraphs. If the benefits payable under this Plan correspond to Qualified Pension
Plan benefits with multiple commencement dates, each portion of the benefits payable under this Plan shall be paid at the same time as the corresponding
portion of the benefits is paid from the Qualified Pension Plan. If a Participant is not entitled to benefits under the Qualified Pension Plan, benefits shall be
paid as if the Participant had been a member of the Lockheed Martin Retirement Plan for Certain Salaried Employees (or such other Qualified Retirement
Plan as designated by the Committee) and had chosen from among the forms of payment available under such Plan. If an Employee’s benefits under the
Qualified Pension Plan are suspended for any month in accordance with the re-employment provisions thereof, the Participant’s benefit for that month shall
likewise be suspended under Articles III and IV of this Plan.
Lump Sum Option. A Participant may irrevocably elect to receive a full or partial single lump sum payment in an amount which is
the actuarial equivalent of the benefit described above. The actuarial equivalent will be computed using the Actuarial Equivalent, and with no interest for the
period between the date of termination of employment and the payment date. This election must be made within the time period for electing the form of
benefit under the corresponding Qualified Pension Plan, by filing a written election in the form and manner prescribed by the Company. Payment will be
made six (6) months following the date payments would otherwise begin pursuant to the above paragraph. If a Participant is not entitled to
benefits under the Qualified Pension Plan, the Participant may make the election at any time after the Participant would have qualified for early retirement
under the Qualified Pension Plan had the Participant been a member of such Plan. Payment will be made six (6) months following the date of such
Participant’s election.
Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit. In the event the Participant dies prior to the date his or her retirement has commenced under this
Plan and the corresponding Qualified Pension Plan, the pre-retirement survivor benefit payable to the surviving spouse (if any) under this Plan (the “Pre-
Retirement Survivor Benefit” and the “Surviving Spouse”) will be payable, at the election of the Surviving Spouse, in any of the following forms:
 
 (a)in the form of a monthly annuity payable to the Surviving Spouse for his lifetime, with no further payments to anyone after his death (which will
be referred to as the “Regular Form”);
 
 (b)in the form of a lump sum payment which is the actuarial equivalent of the Regular Form (the “100% Lump Sum”), but with actuarial
equivalence determined as of the Election Date using the Actuarial Equivalent, and with no interest for the period between the Election Date (or,
if later, the date the Participant would have attained age 55 had he survived) and the payment date; or
 
 (c)in the form of a combined lump sum and life annuity benefit of (x) and (y), where (x) equals a lump sum amount selected by the Surviving
Spouse which is less than the 100% Lump Sum and (y) is a monthly single life annuity for the life of Surviving Spouse (with no further payments
to anyone after his death) in an amount that can be provided with the difference between (x) and the 100% Lump Sum.
Any election to receive the benefit in the form of a lump sum as set forth in (b) above or a combined lump sum and annuity as set forth in (c) above must be
made by the Surviving Spouse no later than 90 days after the date of the Participant’s death or, if later, the date the Participant would have attained age 55 had
he survived (with the date such election is made by the Surviving Spouse referred to as the “Election Date”). In the event the Surviving Spouse makes an
election for a lump sum or partial lump sum payment within this period, payment will not be made to the Surviving Spouse until six months after the Election
Date (or, if later, six months after the date the benefit would otherwise be payable under this Plan).
Cash-out of Small Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, if the Value of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary
under this Plan does not exceed the amount that may be distributed without consent under Section 411(a)(11) of the Code, all such benefits will be paid in a
single lump sum payment in full discharge of all liabilities with respect to such
benefits. For purposes of this Section, Value shall be determined as of the Participant’s termination of employment, and shall mean the present value of a
Participant’s or Beneficiary’s benefits based upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate in Code section 417(e)(3)(ii) for the calendar
month preceding the Plan Year in which the termination of employment occurs.
3. Deductibility of Payments. In the event that the payment of benefits under Section 2 would prevent the Company from claiming an income tax
deduction with respect to any portion of the benefits paid, the Committee shall have the right to modify the form and timing of distributions as necessary to
maximize the Company’s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a modified distribution schedule, the Committee shall undertake to have
distributions made at such times and in such amounts as most closely approximate the payment method described in Section 2, consistent with the objective
of maximum deductibility for the Company. The Committee shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’s accrued benefit under this Plan or to pay
aggregate benefits less than the Participant’s accrued benefit in the event that all or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the Company.
4. Change of Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Committee determines in good faith, based on consultation with counsel, that
the federal income tax treatment or legal status of this Plan has or may be adversely affected by a change in the Code, Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, or other applicable law or by an administrative or judicial construction thereof, the Committee may direct that the benefits of
affected Participants or of all Participants be distributed as soon as practicable after such determination is made, to the extent deemed necessary or advisable
by the Committee to cure or mitigate the consequences, or possible consequences of, such change in law or interpretation thereof.
5. Acceleration upon Change in Control.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the accrued benefit of each Participant shall be distributed in a single lump sum within fifteen
(15) calendar days following a “Change in Control.”
For purposes of this Plan, a Change in Control shall include and be deemed to occur upon the following events:
 
 (a)A tender offer or exchange offer is consummated for the ownership of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined
voting power of the Company’s then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
 (b)The Company is merged, combined, consolidated, recapitalized or otherwise reorganized with one or more other entities that are not Subsidiaries
and, as a result of the merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization or other reorganization, less than 75% of the outstanding voting
securities of the surviving or resulting corporation shall immediately after the event be owned in the aggregate by the stockholders of the
Company (directly or indirectly), determined on the basis of record ownership as of the date of determination of holders entitled to vote on the
action (or in the absence of a vote, the day immediately prior to the event).
 
 (c)Any person (as this term is used in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, but excluding any person described in and satisfying the
conditions of Rule 13d-1(b)(1) thereunder), becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities
entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
 
 (d)At any time within any period of two years after a tender offer, merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization, or other reorganization or a
contested election, or any combination of these events, the “Incumbent Directors” shall cease to constitute at least a majority of the authorized
number of members of the Board. For purposes hereof, “Incumbent Directors” shall mean the persons who were members of the Board
immediately before the first of these events and the persons who were elected or nominated as their successors or pursuant to increases in the size
of the Board by a vote of at least three-fourths of the Board members who were then Board members (or successors or additional members so
elected or nominated).
 
 (e)The stockholders of the Company approve a plan of liquidation and dissolution or the sale or transfer of substantially all of the Company’s
business and/or assets as an entirety to an entity that is not a Subsidiary.
This Section 5 shall apply only to a Change in Control of Lockheed Martin Corporation and shall not cause immediate payout of benefits under
this Plan in any transaction involving the Company’s sale, liquidation, merger, or other disposition of any subsidiary.
The Committee may cancel or modify this Section 5 at any time prior to a Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, this Section 5
shall remain in force and effect, and shall not be subject to cancellation or modification for a period of five years, and any defined term used in Section 5 shall
not, for purposes of Section 5, be subject to cancellation or modification during the five year period
6. Tax Withholding. To the extent required by law, the Company shall withhold from benefit payments hereunder any Federal, state, or local income or
payroll taxes required to be withheld and shall furnish the recipient and the applicable government agency or agencies with such reports, statements, or
information as may be legally required. No benefit payments shall be made to the Participant until the withholding obligation for taxes under Code sections
3101(a) and 3101(b) has been satisfied with respect to the Participant.
7. Retiree Medical Withholding. A Participant may direct the Company to withhold from the Participant’s benefit payments hereunder all or a portion
of the amount that the Participant is required to pay for Company-provided retiree medical coverage.
8. Reemployment. The retirement benefit otherwise payable hereunder to any Participant who previously retired or otherwise had a Termination of
Employment and is subsequently reemployed shall be treated in a manner consistent with the treatment of the benefit under the applicable Qualified Pension
Plan or Designated Qualified Plan.
9. Mistaken Payments. No Participant or Beneficiary shall have any right to any payment made (1) in error, (2) in contravention to the terms of the
Plan, the Code, or ERISA, or (3) because the Committee or its delegates were not informed of any death. The Committee shall have full rights under the law
and ERISA to recover any such mistaken payment, and the right to recover attorney’s fees and other costs incurred with respect to such recovery. Recovery
shall be made from future Plan payments, or by any other available means.
ARTICLE VI
EXTENT OF PARTICIPANTS’ RIGHTS
1. Unfunded Status of Plan. This Plan constitutes a mere contractual promise by the Company to make payments in the future, and each Participant’s
rights shall be those of a general, unsecured creditor of the Company. No Participant shall have any beneficial interest in any specific assets that the Company
may hold or set aside in connection with this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to assist the Company in meeting its obligations under this Plan, the
Company may set aside assets in a trust or trusts described in Revenue Procedure 92-64, 1992-2 C.B. 422, and the Company may direct that its obligations
under this Plan be satisfied by payments out of such trust or trusts. The assets of any such trust will remain subject to the claims of the general creditors of the
Company. It is the Company’s intention that the Plan be unfunded for Federal income tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974.
2. Nonalienability of Benefits. A Participant’s rights under this Plan shall not be assignable or transferable and any purported transfer, assignment,
pledge or other encumbrance or attachment of any payments or benefits under this Plan, or any interest therein shall not be
permitted or recognized, other than the designation of, or passage of payment rights to, a Beneficiary or transfer of an interest in this Plan to a Participant’s
former spouse incident to divorce under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.
3. Forfeiture. If, following the date on which a Participant shall retire under this Plan, a Participant shall engage in the operation or management of a
business, whether as owner, stockholder, partner, officer, employee, consultant, or otherwise, which at such time is in competition with the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, or shall disclose to unauthorized persons information relative to the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which the Participant
shall have reason to believe is confidential, or otherwise act, or conduct oneself, in a manner which the Participant shall have reason to believe is contrary to
the best interest of the Company, or shall be found by the Committee to have committed an act during the term of the Participant’s employment which would
have justified the Participant being discharged for cause, the Participant’s retirement benefit under this Plan shall terminate. Application of this Section will
be at the discretion of the Committee.
ARTICLE VII
AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION
1. Amendment. The Board or its authorized delegate may amend, modify, suspend or discontinue this Plan at any time subject to any shareholder
approval that may be required under applicable law, provided, however, that no such amendment shall have the effect of reducing a Participant’s accrued
benefit or postponing the time when a Participant is entitled to receive a distribution of his accrued benefit unless each affected Participant consents to such
change.
2. Termination. The Board reserves the right to terminate this Plan at any time and to pay all Participants their accrued benefits in a lump sum or to
make other provisions for the payment of benefits (e.g. purchase of annuities) immediately following such termination or at such time thereafter as the Board
may determine.
3. Transfer of Liability. The Board reserves the right to transfer to another entity all of the obligations of Company with respect to a Participant under
this Plan if such entity agrees pursuant to a binding written agreement with the Company or its subsidiaries to assume all of the obligations of the Company
under this Plan with respect to such Participant.
4. Merger. The Board reserves the right to merge all or part of this Plan with or into another plan, provided (1) such other plan preserves all of the
obligations of the Company under this Plan with respect to such Participant and (2) each Participant in the Plan would (if the Plan then terminated) receive a
benefit immediately after the merger which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger (if the
Plan had then terminated).
ARTICLE VIII
ADMINISTRATION
1. The Committee. This Plan shall be administered by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board or such other
committee of the Board as may be designated by the Board. The members of the Committee shall be designated by the Board. A majority of the members of
the Committee (but not fewer than two) shall constitute a quorum. The vote of a majority of a quorum or the unanimous written consent of the Committee
shall constitute action by the Committee. The Committee and its delegates (including the Claims Administrator) shall have full discretion to construe and
interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan, which interpretation or construction shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties, including but not
limited to the Company and any Participant or Beneficiary, except as otherwise provided by law. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6, the Committee
delegates the authority to adjudicate claims to the Pension Plans Administrative Committee.
2. Delegation and Reliance. The Committee may delegate to the officers or employees of the Company the authority to execute and deliver those
instruments and documents, to do all acts and things, and to take all other steps deemed necessary, advisable or convenient for the effective administration of
this Plan in accordance with its terms and purpose. In making any determination or in taking or not taking any action under this Plan, the Committee or its
delegate may obtain and rely upon the advice of experts, including professional advisors to the Company. No member of the Committee or officer of the
Company who is a Participant hereunder may participate in any decision specifically relating to his or her individual rights or benefits under the Plan.
3. Exculpation and Indemnity. Neither the Company nor any member of the Board or of the Committee, nor any other person participating in any
determination of any question under this Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, shall have any liability to any party for any action
taken or not taken in good faith under this Plan or for the failure of the Plan or any Participant’s rights under the Plan to achieve intended tax consequences, or
to comply with any other law, compliance with which is not required on the part of the Company.
4. Facility of Payment. If a minor, person declared incompetent, or person incapable of handling the disposition of his or her property is entitled to
receive a benefit, make an application, or make an election hereunder, the Committee or the Claims Administrator may direct that such benefits be paid to, or
such application or election be made by, the guardian, legal representative, or person having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent, or incapable
person. Any payment made, application allowed, or election implemented in accordance with this Section shall completely discharge the Company and the
Committee (or the Claims Administrator) from all liability with respect thereto.
5. Proof of Claims. The Committee and the Claims Administrator may require proof of the death, disability, incompetency, minority, or incapacity of
any Participant or Beneficiary and of the right of a person to receive any benefit or make any application or election.
6. Claim Procedures. The procedures when a claim under this Plan is wholly or partially denied by Claims Administrator are as follows:
 
 (a) The Claims Administrator shall, within 90 days after receipt of a claim, furnish to claimant a written notice setting forth, in a manner
calculated to be understood by claimant: (1) the specific reason or reasons for the denial; (2) specific reference to pertinent Plan
provisions on which the denial is based; (3) a description of any additional materials or information necessary for the claimant to perfect
the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; (4) an explanation of the steps to be taken if the claimant
wishes to have the denial reviewed; and (5) a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA
following an adverse determination on review. The 90 day period may be extended for not more than an additional 90 days if special
circumstances make such an extension necessary. The Claims Administrator shall give the claimant, before the end of the initial 90 day
period, a written notice of such extension, stating such special circumstances and the date by which the Claims Administrator expects to
render a decision.
 
 (b) By a written application filed with the Claims Administrator within 60 days after receipt by claimant of the written notice described in
paragraph (a), the claimant or his duly authorized representative may request review of the denial of his claim.
 
 (c) In connection with such review, the claimant or his duly authorized representative may submit issues, comments, documents, records and
other information relating to the claim for benefits to the Claims Administrator. In addition, the claimant will be provided, upon request
and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, or other information “relevant” to claimant’s claim for
benefits. A document, record, or other information is “relevant” if it: (1) was relied upon in making the benefit determination; (2) was
submitted, considered or generated in the course of making the benefit determination, without regard to whether such document, record
or information was relied upon in making the benefit determination; or (3) demonstrates compliance with administrative processes and
safeguards required under federal law.
 (d) The Plan will provide an impartial review that takes into account all comments, records and other information submitted by the claimant
relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The
Claims Administrator shall make a decision and furnish such decision in writing to the claimant within 60 days after receipt by the
Claims Administrator of the request for review. This period may be extended to not more than 120 days after such receipt if special
circumstances make such an extension necessary. The claimant will be notified in writing prior to the expiration of the original 60 day
period if such an extension is required, and such notice will include the reason for the extension and the date by which it is expected that
a decision will be reached,
 
 (e) The decision on review shall be in writing, set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include: (1) the
specific reasons for the decision; (2) specific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based; (3) a statement
that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, and
other information “relevant” to the claimant’s claim for benefits; (4) a description of any additional material or information necessary for
the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; (5) a statement describing any
voluntary appeal procedures and the claimant’s right to obtain information about such procedures, if any; and (6) a statement of the
claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review.
 
 (f) In the event that the Claims Administrator must make a determination of disability in order to decide a claim, the Claims Administrator
shall follow the special claims procedures for disability benefits described in Department of Labor Regulation section 2560.503-1(d). The
Claims Administrator shall render a decision within a reasonable time (not to exceed 90 days) after the claimant’s request for review,
rather than within 120 days as set forth in the above paragraph.
 
 (g) For purposes of this Section 6, claimant shall include the duly authorized representative of claimant, if any.
 
 (h) The Claims Administrator shall be the Lockheed Martin Corporation Pension Plans Administration Committee. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to claims and appeals brought by elected officers of the Company, the Claims Administrator shall be the
Committee.

Martin Corporation (Restated Through July 1, 2015)
LOCKHEED MARTIN SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN
FOR TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES OF GE OPERATIONS
(Restated as of July 1, 2014)
ARTICLE I
PURPOSES OF THE PLAN
The purposes of the Lockheed Martin Supplementary Pension Plan for Transferred Employees of GE Operations (the “Plan”) is to provide Transferred
Employees with a supplemental pension benefit that, in combination with the Martin Marietta Corporation Retirement Income Plan II (now part of the
Lockheed Martin Corporation Salaried Employee Retirement Program ) or KAPL Inc. Pension Plan for Salaried Employees and anticipated social security
benefits, delivers a total retirement income equal to a maximum of 60 percent of the employee’s average compensation over the final three years.
The Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2005, in order to comply with the requirements of Code section 409A. The amendment and
restatement applied only to the portion of a Participant’s benefit that is earned or becomes vested on or after January 1, 2005. The portion of a Participant’s
benefit that was earned and vested prior to January 1, 2005, shall be governed by Appendix A. The Plan was amended and restated, effective June 26, 2008,
in order to clarify certain provisions in accordance with the final Treasury Regulations issued under Code section 409A and to make other clarifications with
respect to eligibility and benefits. The Plan was amended and restated effective December 31, 2008, to order to make further clarifications in accordance with
the final Treasury Regulations issued under Code section 409A and to make other administrative clarifications. The Plan is hereby amended and restated
effective December 31, 2010, to order to make further clarifications in accordance with the final Treasury Regulations issued under Code section 409A and to
make other administrative clarifications. The Qualified Pension Plan is being amended: (1) , effective January 1, 2016, to provide that pensionable earnings
under the Qualified Pension Plan shall not include amounts earned for or relating to any period after December 31, 2015; and (2) effective January 1, 2020, to
freeze credited service under the Qualified Pension Plan and to provide that no Qualified Pension Plan participant shall accrue credited service with respect to
any period after December 31, 2019. The Plan is hereby amended and restated to confirm that these Qualified Pension Plan amendments shall carry through
to any applicable provision in this Plan, including all Annexes and Appendices to the Plan. Accordingly, base rate of pay, bonuses or other incentive
compensation, or other amounts earned for or relating to the period after December 31, 2015, shall not be used in determining benefits under the Plan, and
service after December 31, 2019, shall not be considered, deemed to be, or otherwise treated as Credited Service or similar benefit accrual service in
determining benefits payable under the Plan.

more years of Vesting Service and who is a participant in the Qualified Pension Plan shall be eligible to receive benefits under this Article III. However,
except as provided in Section 2.D., an Employee who retires under the Qualified Pension Plan before the first day of the month following attainment of age
55 or an Employee who leaves the Service of the Company before attainment of age 55, shall not be eligible for a benefit under this Article III.
An Employee who meets the other requirements specified in this Section shall be eligible for benefits under this Article III so long as his
assigned position level or position of equivalent responsibility throughout any consecutive three years of the 15 year period ending on the last day of the
month preceding his termination of service is at least at the level of a director (or other position equivalent to General Electric Company’s EB) even though he
is not employed at that level on the date his Service terminates.
2. Amount of Benefit.
A. Definitions. For purposes of this Section 2, the following terms have the following meanings:
Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit. The annual equivalent of the maximum possible Primary Insurance Amount payable, after reduction
for early retirement, as an old-age benefit to an employee who retired at age 62 on January 1 of the calendar year in which occurred the Employee’s actual
date of retirement or death, or December 31. 2015, whichever is earlier. The Company shall determine the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit in
accordance with the Social Security Act in effect at the end of the calendar year preceding such January 1.
If an Employee has less than 35 years of Credited Service, the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit determined under the above paragraph
is multiplied by a factor, the numerator of which is the number of years of the Employees’ Credited Service to his or her date of retirement or death, or
December 31, 2019, whichever is earlier, and the denominator of which is 35.
The Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit shall be adjusted to include any social security, severance, or similar benefit provided under
foreign law or regulations as the Committee may prescribe by rules and regulations.
Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan. The sum of:
 
 (1) (i) the annual normal, early or late retirement benefit under Article V of the Qualified Pension Plan, including the Personal Pension
Account (excluding the regular supplement under Article V(4) of the Qualified Pension Plan), or (ii) the normal, optional or disability
retirement benefit under the RIP II or KAPL Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan, less
 
 (2) to the extent the Committee so determines, the benefit payable under any other pension plan contract, or policy of the Plan Sponsor
(whether qualified or non-qualified), or government program attributable to periods of service for which Credited Service is granted by
the Committee for the determination of the benefit under this Plan or is credited by the Qualified Pension. All such amounts shall be
determined before applying any reduction factors for Early, Optional or Disability Retirement, for election of any optional form of
Pension at retirement, a qualified domestic relations order(s), if any, or in connection with any other adjustment or supplement made
pursuant to the Qualified Pension Plan or any other pension plan.
For purposes of this paragraph, the Employee’s Pension shall include the Personal Pension Account Annuity payable to the Employee or the Employee’s
spouse on the date of the Employee’s retirement or death, regardless of whether such annuity commenced on such date.
Annual Retirement Income. For Employees who retire or die in active Service on or after April 5, 1993, the amount determined by multiplying
1.75% of Average Annual Compensation by the number of years of Credited Service completed at the date of retirement or death, or December 31, 2019,
whichever is earlier.
Average Annual Compensation. One-third of the Employee’s Compensation for the highest consecutive three years during the last 10 years
immediately preceding his date of retirement or death, whichever is earlier. In computing Average Annual Compensation, normal
straight-time earnings shall be substituted for actual Compensation for any month in which such normal straight-time earnings are greater. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Average Annual Compensation will be frozen effective as of January 1, 2016. Accordingly, for purposes of determining Average Annual
Compensation, the term “years” above shall not include any period after December 31, 2015, and Average Annual Compensation shall not include amounts
earned for or relating to any period after December, 31, 2015.
Compensation. Salary (including any deferred salary approved by the Committee as compensation for purposes of this Plan) plus:
 
 (1) For persons then eligible for Incentive Compensation, the total amount of any Management Incentive Compensation Plan earnings,
unless such Incentive Compensation is excluded by the Board or a committee thereof;
 
 (2) For persons who would then have been eligible for Incentive Compensation if they had not been participants in a Sales Commission Plan
or other variable compensation plan, the total amount of sales commissions (or other variable compensation earned unless such
compensation is excluded by the Board or a committee thereof);
 
 (3) For all other persons, the sales commissions and other variable compensation earned to the extent such earnings were then included under
the Qualified Pension Plan, plus any amounts (other than salary and those mentioned in clauses (1) through (3) above) which were then
included as compensation under the Qualified Pension Plan except any amounts which the Committee may exclude from the computation
of “Compensation” and subject to the powers of the Committee with respect to payment of benefits.
The Committee shall specify the basis for determining an Employee’s Compensation for any portion of the three years used to compute the Employee’s
Average Annual Compensation during which the Employee was not employed by an employer participating in this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Compensation will be frozen effective as of January 1, 2016. Accordingly, Compensation shall not include amounts earned for or relating to any period after
December, 31, 2015.
Credited Service. Credited Service has the same meaning as in the Qualified Pension Plan. For periods before January 1, 1976, Credited Service
as a full-time Employee also includes all Service credited under the Qualified Pension Plan for any period during which the employee was a full-time
Employee for purposes of the Qualified Pension Plan. Credited Service also includes:
 
 (1) Any period of Service with the Company or an Affiliate as the Committee may otherwise provide by rules and regulations issued with
respect to this Plan; and
 (2) Any period of service with another employer as the Board may approve, if any conditions specified in such approval have been met.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant’s Credited Service shall be frozen effective January 1, 2020, and no Participant shall accrue further Credited
Service under this Plan with respect to any period after December 31, 2019.
B. Normal Retirement Benefit. Subject to the limitations in Section G and the requirements of Code section 409A, the benefit payable to an eligible
Employee who has a Termination of Employment on or after his or her normal retirement date under the Plan, shall be the excess, if any, of the employee’s
Annual Retirement Income, over the sum of:
 
 (1) The Employee’s Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan (including the Personal Pension Account Annuity and
excluding any supplements payable under the Qualified Pension Plan) (calculated as a five-year certain annuity),
 
 (2)  1⁄2 of the Employee’s Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit,
 
 (3) the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan.
C. Early, Optional or Disability Retirement. Subject to the limitations in Section G and Section 1 of Article VII, the benefit payable to an eligible
Employee who, after reaching age 60, retires on an optional retirement date under the Qualified Pension Plan shall be computed in the manner provided by
Section B (for an employee retiring on his or her normal retirement date) but taking into account only Credited Service and Average Annual Compensation to
the actual date of optional retirement. The annual benefit payable to an eligible Employee who, after reaching age 55 (but before reaching age 60), retires
under the early retirement provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan shall equal the amount in section B but taking into account only Credited Service and
Average Annual Compensation to the Employee’s actual Termination of Employment and reduced for early retirement using the early retirement reduction
factor under Article V(2) of the Qualified Pension Plan.
Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, the annual benefit payable to an eligible Employee who has satisfied the eligibility
requirements to receive a Disability Pension under the RIP II or KAPL Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan (to the extent consistent with the requirements of
Code section 409A(a)(2(C)) shall be computed in the manner provided by Section B (for an Employee retiring on his normal retirement date) taking into
account only Credited Service and Average Annual Compensation to the actual date of disability retirement and not reduced for the Disability Supplement in
the RIP II or KAPL Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan. In the case of an eligible Employee whose date of retirement precedes the first day of the month
after reaching age 60 the Plan benefit shall then be reduced by 12%.
If the Disability Pension payable to the Employee under the Qualified Pension Plan is discontinued as a result of the Employee’s disability
ceasing before the Employee reaches age 60, the benefit provided under this Section C shall also be discontinued to the extent permitted under Code section
409A.
D. Special Benefit Protection for Certain Employees. Subject to the provisions of Code section 409A, a former Employee whose Service with the
Company is terminated on or after December 31, 1994, and after completing 25 or more years of Vesting Service, who does not withdraw his required or
voluntary contributions from the Qualified Pension Plan before retirement, shall be eligible for a benefit under this Plan commencing upon the later of
Termination of Employment with the Company and the attainment of age 60 if:
 
 (1) the Employee’s Service is terminated for transfer to a successor employer and
 
 (2) the Employee does not retire under the Qualified Pension Plan until the later of (1) termination of service with the successor employer
and (2) the first of the month after reaching age 60.
In determining the benefit under this Plan, the Average Annual Compensation shall be based on the last 120 completed months with the successor
employer before the Employee’s Service termination date and the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit shall be determined as though the Employee’s
retirement date was the date of termination. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “120 completed months” shall not include any period after
December 31, 2015.
E. Survivor Benefits. Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, if a survivor benefit applies with respect to the past and future service annuity
portion of an Employee’s Annual Pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan, such survivor benefit shall automatically apply to any benefit which he
or she may be eligible under this Plan. The Employee’s benefit shall be adjusted and paid in the same manner as such pension payable under the Qualified
Pension Plan is adjusted and paid on account of such survivor benefit. Payments to the survivor shall commence as soon as administratively practicable (but
not later than 90 days) following the later of: (1) the Employee’s 55th birthday, or (2) the Employee’s date of death.
F. Payments Upon Death. Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, if an eligible Employee dies in active Service, or following Termination of
Employment with a benefit from this Plan, and a death benefit (other than a return of Employee contributions with interest including an Employee’s Personal
and Voluntary Pension Account) is payable to the beneficiary or Surviving Spouse of such Employee under the Qualified Pension Plan, a death benefit shall
also be payable to the beneficiary or Surviving Spouse under this Plan as follows:
 
 (1) Any such death benefit payable to a surviving spouse under this Plan shall equal 50% of the Employee’s Annual Retirement Income
under this Plan reduced by (1) 100% of the Employee’s preretirement surviving spouse benefit payable or other lump sum benefit under
the Qualified Pension Plan, (2) 25% of the
 Employee’s Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit, (3) the Employee’s Personal Pension Account benefit, and (4) the benefit payable
under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan. Payments to the surviving spouse shall commence as soon as
administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days) after the later of: (1) the Employee’s 55th birthday, or (2) the Employee’s date of
death, subject to the requirements of Code section 409A if the beneficiary or Surviving Spouse is entitled to benefits under more than one
supplemental pension plan.
 
 (2) Any such death benefit payable to a surviving spouse under this Plan shall take into account only Credited Service and Average Annual
Compensation to the earlier of the Employee’s death or termination of employment and will be reduced for early retirement using the
early retirement reduction factors under Article V(2) of the Qualified Pension Plan.
 
 (3) Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, any such benefit payable to a surviving spouse shall be paid as soon as
administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days) after the later of: (1) the Employee’s 55th birthday, or (2) the Employee’s date of
death and will be paid in accordance with the payment provisions of the RIP or KAPL Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan. If benefits
from the Qualified Pension Plan are paid under the payment provisions of the RIP or KAPL Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan, then
benefits from this Plan will be paid in the same payment form.
G. Limitations on Benefits.
(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the sum of:
 
 (1) The annual benefit (calculated before applying any reductions for early retirement or additions for any supplements payable under the
Qualified Pension Plan, and prior to any calculation for disability retirement reductions) otherwise payable to an Employee under this
Plan;
 
 (2) The Employee’s Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan (including the Personal Pension Account Annuity) (calculated
as a five-year certain annuity);
 
 (3) 100% of the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit before any adjustment for less than 35 years of Pension Benefit Service;
 
 (4) the Employee’s annual benefit under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan; and
to the extent the Committee so determines, the benefit payable under any other pension plan contract, or policy of the Plan Sponsor (whether qualified
or non-qualified), or government program attributable to periods of service for which Credited Service is granted
by the Committee for the determination of the benefit under this Plan or is credited by the Qualified Pension exceeds 60% of his or her Annual Average
Compensation, the benefit payable under this Plan shall be reduced by the amount of the excess, to the extent permitted by Code section 409A.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, the amount of the benefit payable and any death benefit payable to or on behalf of any
Employee who is or was an Officer of the Company on the date of his Termination of Employment or death, whichever is earlier, shall be determined
according to such general rules and regulations as a Committee appointed by the Board of Directors may adopt, subject to the limitation that any such
benefit or death benefit may not exceed the amount which would be payable under this Plan in the absence of such rules and regulations.
H. Adjustments Following Retirement. If the Pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Employee is increased following the Employee’s
retirement as a result of a general increase in the Pensions payable to retired employees under that plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan.
I. Non-duplication of Benefits. Benefits under this Article III are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit under the Qualified Pension
Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the Qualified Pension Plan with the special
adjustments described above. To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced benefit described above
shall be calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified Pension Plan
and further reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan, then reduced by the Grandfathered 2004
Benefit, to the extent permitted by Code section 409A. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the
Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
J. Plan Freeze. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article IV, base rate of pay, bonuses or other incentive compensation, or other amounts
earned for or relating to the period after December 31, 2015, shall not be used in determining benefits under the Plan, and service after December 31, 2019,
shall not be considered, deemed to be, or otherwise treated as Credited Service or similar benefit accrual service in determining benefits payable under the
Plan.
ARTICLE IV
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1. Vesting. Except as provided in Article V, and subject to the Company’s right to discontinue the Plan as provided in Article VI, a Participant shall
have a non-forfeitable interest in benefits payable under this Plan to the same extent as benefits are vested under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan. As
provided in Article V, if a Participant acquires a right to receive payments under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured
general creditor of the Company.
2. Form of Payment. All elections under this Section 2 must be made in the form and manner prescribed by the Senior Vice President, Human
Resources. No election made pursuant to this Section 2 may affect a payment due in the same calendar year in which the election is made or accelerate
payment into the calendar year in which the election is made. No lump sum distributions are available under this Plan. Benefits under this Plan shall be paid
in the form of an annuity commencing as soon as administratively practicable (but no more than 90 days) following the later of (i) the month in which the
Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
benefits paid to a Participant who is reasonably determined by the Company to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code section 409A(2)(B)(i),
shall not commence before the later of (i) six (6) months following the month in which the Participant has Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in
which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55),
as applicable, and the payment date.
Selection of Annuity Form. To the extent permitted under Code section 409A, prior to his Termination of Employment or attainment of age 55,
as applicable, a Participant may elect to receive benefits in any actuarially equivalent annuity form that is available under the applicable Qualified Pension
Plan on the date of the Participant’s election that has been designated by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources as available for election under this Plan.
If the Participant has not validly elected an annuity form before his Termination of Employment or attainment of age 55, as applicable, (i) an unmarried
Participant shall be deemed to have elected payment in the form of a monthly annuity for the life of the Participant with no further payments to anyone after
his or her death, and (ii) a married Participant shall be deemed to have elected payment in the form of a reduced monthly annuity for the life of the Participant
with, after the Participant’s death, a 50% survivor annuity for the life of the Participant’s spouse. Actuarial adjustments shall be based on the factors set forth
in the Qualified Pension Plan.
Cash-out of Small Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, if the Value of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary under this
Plan does not exceed $10,000, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum payment in full discharge of all liabilities with respect to such benefits. For
purposes of this Section, Value shall be determined as of the
Participant’s Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and shall mean the present value of a Participant’s or
Beneficiary’s benefits, excluding the Grandfathered 2004 Benefit, based (i) for Terminations prior to January 1, 2008, upon the applicable mortality table and
applicable interest rate in Code section 417(e)(3)(ii), or (ii) for terminations on or after January 1, 2008, upon the applicable mortality table and applicable
interest rate under Code section 417(e)(3), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, for the calendar month preceding the Plan Year in which the
Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55) occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, benefits paid under this Section 2 to a
Participant who is reasonably determined by the Company to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), shall not
commence before the later of (i) six (6) months following the month in which the Participant Terminates Employment, or (ii) the month in which the
Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as
applicable, and the payment date.
Prospective Elections. Participants may elect to further delay the commencement of benefits as provided in this Section 2.c. This Section 2.c.
does not apply to Surviving Spouses or Beneficiaries. A new election under this section shall be made by executing and delivering to the Company an
election in such form as prescribed by the Company. To constitute a valid election by a Participant making a prospective change to a previous election, (i) the
prospective election must be executed and delivered to the Company at least twelve (12) months before the date the first payment would be due under the
Participant’s previous election, and (ii) the first payment must be delayed by at least sixty (60) months from the date the first payment would be due under the
Participant’s previous election, and (iii) such change in election shall not be given effect until twelve (12) months from the date that the change in election is
delivered to the Company. In the event an election fails to satisfy the provisions set forth in this paragraph, such election shall be void and, if such an election
is void, payment shall be made in accordance with the most recent election which was valid. Other changes in the form of benefit may be made only as
determined by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, of the Company in accordance with Code section 409A.
If a Participant participates in more than one supplemental pension plan sponsored by the Corporation, the Participant must make a single election with
respect to the form of annuity that shall apply to his or her benefits under all such plans and with respect to prospective changes of payment under this
Section 2 of Article IV.
Notwithstanding the above, for periods prior to January 1, 2009, (or such later date as may be provided by the Internal Revenue Service in guidance of
general applicability), the Senior Vice President, Human Resources may provide alternative rules for elections with respect to the commencement of payment
and form of payment, provided that such rules conform to Code section 409A and Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder.
3. Deductibility of Payments. Subject to the provisions of Section Code section 409A, in the event that the Company reasonably anticipates that the
payment of benefits in accordance with the Participant’s election under Section 2 would prevent the Company from claiming an income tax deduction with
respect to any portion of the benefits paid under Code section 162(m), the Committee shall have the right to delay the timing of distributions from the
Participant’s Account as necessary to maximize the Company’s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a delayed distribution schedule, the
Committee shall undertake to have distributions made at such times and in such amounts as the Company reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably
anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year, the deduction will not be barred by Code section 162(m) or upon a Termination of Employment in
accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-2(b)(7)(i), consistent with the objective of maximum deductibility for the Company. The Committee
shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’s Account Balance or to pay aggregate benefits less than the Participant’s Account Balance in the event that all
or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the Company. All scheduled payments under this Plan and any other plan required to be aggregated with this
Plan must be delayed in order for such payment to be delayed pursuant to this Section 3.
4. Change of Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Committee determines in good faith, based on consultation with counsel and
in accordance with the requirements of Code section 409A, that the federal income tax treatment or legal status of this Plan has or may be adversely affected
by a change in the Code, Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or other applicable law or by an administrative or judicial
construction thereof, the Committee may direct that the benefits of affected Participants or of all Participants be distributed as soon as practicable after such
determination is made, to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by the Committee to cure or mitigate the consequences, or possible consequences of, such
change in law or interpretation thereof.
5. Acceleration upon Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the accrued benefit of each Participant shall be one-hundred
percent (100%) vested and distributed in a single lump sum within fifteen (15) calendar days following a “Change in Control.”
For purposes of this Plan, a Change in Control shall include and be deemed to occur upon the following events:
 
 (a)A tender offer or exchange offer is consummated for the ownership of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined
voting power of the Company’s then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
 
 (b)The Company is merged, combined, consolidated, recapitalized or otherwise reorganized with one or more other entities that are not Company
Subsidiaries and, as a result of the merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization or other reorganization, less than 75% of the outstanding
voting securities of the
 surviving or resulting corporation shall immediately after the event be owned in the aggregate by the stockholders of the Company (directly or
indirectly), determined on the basis of record ownership as of the date of determination of holders entitled to vote on the action (or in the absence
of a vote, the day immediately prior to the event).
 
 (c)Any person (as this term is used in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, but excluding any person described in and satisfying the
conditions of Rule 13d-1(b)(1) thereunder), becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities
entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
 
 (d)At any time within any period of two years after a tender offer, merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization, or other reorganization or a
contested election, or any combination of these events, the “Incumbent Directors” shall cease to constitute at least a majority of the authorized
number of members of the Board. For purposes hereof, “Incumbent Directors” shall mean the persons who were members of the Board
immediately before the first of these events and the persons who were elected or nominated as their successors or pursuant to increases in the size
of the Board by a vote of at least three-fourths of the Board members who were then Board members (or successors or additional members so
elected or nominated).
 
 (e)The stockholders of the Company approve a plan of liquidation and dissolution or the sale or transfer of substantially all of the Company’s
business and/or assets as an entirety to an entity that is not a Company Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no distribution shall be made solely on account of a Change in Control and prior to the benefit commencement date
specified in Section 2 of Article V unless the Change in Control is both an event qualifying for a distribution of deferred compensation under Section 409A(a)
(2)(A)(v) of the Code and an event qualifying under this Section 5.
This Section 5 shall apply only to a Change in Control of Lockheed Martin Corporation and shall not cause immediate payout of benefits under this
Plan in any transaction involving the Company’s sale, liquidation, merger, or other disposition of any subsidiary.
The Committee may cancel or modify this Section 5 at any time prior to a Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, this Section 5 shall
remain in force and effect, and shall not be subject to cancellation or modification for a period of five years, and any defined term used in Section 5 shall not,
for purposes of Section 5, be subject to cancellation or modification during the five year period.
6. Tax Withholding. To the extent required by law, the Company shall withhold from benefit payments hereunder any Federal, state, or local income or
payroll taxes required to be withheld and shall furnish the recipient and the applicable government agency or agencies with such reports, statements, or
information as may be legally required. No benefit payments shall be made to the Participant until the withholding obligation for taxes under Code sections
3101(a) and 3101(b) has been satisfied with respect to the Participant.
7. Retiree Medical Withholding. A Participant may direct the Company to withhold from the Participant’s benefit payments hereunder all or a portion
of the amount that the Participant is required to pay for Company-provided retiree medical coverage.
ARTICLE V
EXTENT OF PARTICIPANTS’ RIGHTS
1. Unfunded Status of Plan. This Plan constitutes a mere contractual promise by the Company to make payments in the future, and each Participant’s
rights shall be those of a general, unsecured creditor of the Company. No Participant shall have any beneficial interest in any specific assets that the Company
may hold or set aside in connection with this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to assist the Company in meeting its obligations under this Plan, the
Company may set aside assets in a trust or trusts described in Revenue Procedure 92-64, 1992-2 C.B. 422, and the Company may direct that its obligations
under this Plan be satisfied by payments out of such trust or trusts. The assets of any such trust will remain subject to the claims of the general creditors of the
Company. It is the Company’s intention that the Plan be unfunded for Federal income tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974.
2. Nonalienability of Benefits. A Participant’s rights under this Plan shall not be assignable or transferable and any purported transfer, assignment,
pledge or other encumbrance or attachment of any payments or benefits under this Plan, or any interest therein shall not be permitted or recognized, other than
the designation of, or passage of payment rights to, a Beneficiary or transfer of an interest in this Plan to a Participant’s spouse, former spouse, or child
incident to divorce under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (which shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with Code sections 414(p)(1)(B)
and 409A), provided that the form of payment designated in such order is an annuity as provided in Section 2(a) of Article V.
3. Forfeiture. If, following the date on which a Participant shall retire under this Plan, a Participant shall engage in the operation or management of a
business, whether as owner, stockholder, partner, officer, employee, consultant, or otherwise, which at such time is in competition with the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, or shall disclose to unauthorized persons information relative to the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which the Participant
shall have reason to believe is confidential, or otherwise act, or conduct oneself, in a manner which the Participant shall have reason to believe is contrary to
the best interest of the
Company, or shall be found by the Committee to have committed an act during the term of the Participant’s employment which would have justified the
Participant being discharged for cause, the Participant’s retirement benefit under this Plan shall terminate. Application of this Section will be at the discretion
of the Committee.
ARTICLE VI
AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION
1. Amendment. The Board or its authorized delegate may amend, modify, suspend or discontinue this Plan at any time subject to any shareholder
approval that may be required under applicable law, provided, however, that no such amendment shall have the effect of reducing a Participant’s accrued
benefit or postponing the time when a Participant is entitled to receive a distribution of his accrued benefit unless each affected Participant consents to such
change.
2. Termination. The Board reserves the right to terminate this Plan at any time and at such times that the Board reasonably determines in its discretion is
appropriate and conforms to the requirements of Code section 409A, to pay all Participants their accrued benefits in a lump sum or to make other provisions
for the payment of benefits (e.g. purchase of annuities) immediately following such termination or at such time thereafter as the Board may determine.
3. Transfer of Liability. The Board reserves the right to transfer to another entity all of the obligations of Company with respect to a Participant under
this Plan if such entity agrees pursuant to a binding written agreement with the Company or its subsidiaries to assume all of the obligations of the Company
under this Plan with respect to such Participant.
4. Merger. The Board reserves the right to merge all or part of this Plan with or into another plan, provided (1) such other plan preserves all of the
obligations of the Company under this Plan with respect to such Participant and (2) each Participant in the Plan would (if the Plan then terminated) receive a
benefit immediately after the merger which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger (if the
Plan had then terminated).
ARTICLE VII
ADMINISTRATION
1. The Committee. This Plan shall be administered by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board or such other
committee of the Board as may be designated by the Board. The members of the Committee shall be designated by the
Board. A majority of the members of the Committee (but not fewer than two) shall constitute a quorum. The vote of a majority of a quorum or the unanimous
written consent of the Committee shall constitute action by the Committee. The Committee and its delegates (including the Claims Administrator) shall have
full discretion to construe and interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan, which interpretation or construction shall be final, conclusive and binding on all
parties, including but not limited to the Company and any Participant or Beneficiary, except as otherwise provided by law. Notwithstanding anything
contained in the Plan or in any document issued under the Plan, it is intended that the Plan will at all times conform to the requirements of Code section 409A
and any regulations or other guidance issued thereunder, and that the provisions of the Plan will be interpreted to meet such requirements. If any provision of
the Plan is determined not to conform to such requirements, the Plan shall be interpreted to omit such offending provision.
2. Delegation and Reliance. The Committee may delegate to the officers or employees of the Company the authority to execute and deliver those
instruments and documents, to do all acts and things, and to take all other steps deemed necessary, advisable or convenient for the effective administration of
this Plan in accordance with its terms and purpose. In making any determination or in taking or not taking any action under this Plan, the Committee or its
delegate may obtain and rely upon the advice of experts, including professional advisors to the Company. No member of the Committee or officer of the
Company who is a Participant hereunder may participate in any decision specifically relating to his or her individual rights or benefits under the Plan.
3. Exculpation and Indemnity. Neither the Company nor any member of the Board or of the Committee, nor any other person participating in any
determination of any question under this Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, shall have any liability to any party for any action
taken or not taken in good faith under this Plan or for the failure of the Plan or any Participant’s rights under the Plan to achieve intended tax consequences, or
to comply with any other law, compliance with which is not required on the part of the Company.
4. Facility of Payment. If a minor, person declared incompetent, or person incapable of handling the disposition of his or her property is entitled to
receive a benefit, make an application, or make an election hereunder, the Committee or the Claims Administrator may direct that such benefits be paid to, or
such application or election be made by, the guardian, legal representative, or person having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent, or incapable
person. Any payment made, application allowed, or election implemented in accordance with this Section shall completely discharge the Company and the
Committee (or the Claims Administrator) from all liability with respect thereto.
5. Proof of Claims. The Committee or the Claims Administrator may require proof of the death, disability, incompetency, minority, or incapacity of any
Participant or Beneficiary and of the right of a person to receive any benefit or make any application or election.
6. Claim Procedures. The procedures when a claim under this Plan is wholly or partially denied by the Claims Administrator are as follows:
 
 (a)The Claims Administrator shall, within 90 days after receipt of a claim, furnish to claimant a written notice setting forth, in a manner calculated
to be understood by claimant: (1) the specific reason or reasons for the denial; (2) specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the
denial is based; (3) a description of any additional materials or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of
why such material or information is necessary; (4) an explanation of the steps to be taken if the claimant wishes to have the denial reviewed; and
(5) a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse determination on review. The 90
day period may be extended for not more than an additional 90 days if special circumstances make such an extension necessary. The Claims
Administrator shall give the claimant, before the end of the initial 90 day period, a written notice of such extension, stating such special
circumstances and the date by which the Claims Administrator expects to render a decision.
 
 (b)By a written application filed with the Claims Administrator within 60 days after receipt by claimant of the written notice described in paragraph
(a), the claimant or his duly authorized representative may request review of the denial of his claim.
 
 (c)In connection with such review, the claimant or his duly authorized representative may submit issues, comments, documents, records and other
information relating to the claim for benefits to the Claims Administrator. In addition, the claimant will be provided, upon request and free of
charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, or other information “relevant” to claimant’s claim for benefits. A document,
record, or other information is “relevant” if it: (1) was relied upon in making the benefit determination; (2) was submitted, considered or
generated in the course of making the benefit determination, without regard to whether such document, record or information was relied upon in
making the benefit determination; or (3) demonstrates compliance with administrative processes and safeguards required under Federal law.
 
 (d)The Plan will provide an impartial review that takes into account all comments, records and other information submitted by the claimant relating
to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The Claims
Administrator shall make a decision and furnish such decision in writing to the claimant within 60 days after receipt by the Claims Administrator
of the request for review. This period may be extended to not more than 120 days after such receipt if special circumstances make such an
extension necessary. The claimant will be notified in writing prior to the expiration of the original 60 day period if such an extension is required,
and such notice will include the reason for the extension and the date by which it is
 expected that a decision will be reached. The decision on review shall be in writing, set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the
claimant and shall include: (1) the specific reasons for the decision; (2) specific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision
is based; (3) a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents,
records, and other information “relevant” to the claimant’s claim for benefits; (4) a description of any additional material or information
necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; (5) a statement describing
any voluntary appeal procedures and the claimant’s right to obtain information about such procedures, if any; and (6) a statement of the
claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review. If in the event that
the reviewing committee must make a determination of disability in order to decide a claim, the reviewing committee shall follow the special
claims procedures for disability benefits described in Department of Labor Regulation section 2560.503-1(d). The reviewing committee shall
render a decision within a reasonable time (not to exceed 90 days) after the claimant’s request for review, rather than within 120 days as set forth
in the above paragraph.
 
 (e)The Claims Administrator shall be the Lockheed Martin Corporation Pension Plans Administrative Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
with respect to claims and appeals brought by elected officers of the Company, the Claims Administrator shall be the Committee.

LOCKHEED MARTIN SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN
FOR TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES OF GE OPERATIONS
(Effective July 1, 2014)
ARTICLE I
PURPOSES OF THE PLAN
The purposes of the Lockheed Martin Supplementary Pension Plan for Transferred Employees of GE Operations (the “Plan”) is to provide Transferred
Employees with a supplemental pension benefit that, in combination with the Martin Marietta Corporation Retirement Income Plan II (now part of the
Lockheed Martin Corporation Salaried Employee Retirement Program) or KAPL Inc. Pension Plan for Salaried Employees and anticipated social security
benefits, delivers a total retirement income equal to a maximum of 60 percent of the employee’s average compensation over the final three years.
The Lockheed Martin Supplementary Pension Plan for Transferred Employees of GE Operations (formerly known as the Martin Marietta
Supplementary Pension Plan for Employees of Transferred GE Operations) and predecessor plan is amended, restated, effective July 1, 2004.
The Plan was subsequently amended and restated effective January 1, 2005, in order to comply with the requirements of Code section 409A. The
amendment and restatement applies only to the portion of a Participant’s benefit that is earned or becomes vested on or after January 1, 2005. The portion of a
Participant’s benefit that was earned and vested prior to January 1, 2005, shall be governed by this Appendix A. The Qualified Pension Plan was amended:
(1) effective January 1, 2016, to provide that pensionable earnings under the Qualified Pension Plan shall not include amounts earned for or relating to any
period after December 31, 2015; and (2) effective January 1, 2020, to freeze credited service under the Qualified Pension Plan and to provide that no
Qualified Pension Plan participant shall accrue credited service with respect to any period after December 31, 2019. These Qualified Pension Plan
amendments shall carry through to any applicable provision in this Plan, including all Annexes and Appendices to the Plan. Accordingly, base rate of pay,
bonuses or other incentive compensation, or other amounts earned for or relating to the period after December 31, 2015, shall not be used in determining
benefits under the Plan, and service after December 31, 2019, shall not be considered, deemed to be, or otherwise treated as Credited Service or similar
benefit accrual service in determining benefits payable under the Plan.

SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION BENEFIT
1. Eligibility. Each Employee who was classified as an Executive Career Band (“EB”) employee on or prior to December 31, 1993, who has five or
more years of Vesting Service and who is a participant in the Qualified Pension Plan shall be eligible to receive benefits under this Article III. However,
except as provided in Section 2.D., an Employee who retires under the Qualified Pension Plan before the first day of the month following attainment of age
55 or an Employee who leaves the Service of the Company before attainment of age 55, shall not be eligible for a benefit under this Article III.
An Employee who meets the other requirements specified in this Section shall be eligible for benefits under this Article III so long as his
assigned position level or position of equivalent responsibility throughout any consecutive three years of the 15 year period ending on the last day of the
month preceding his termination of service is at least at the level of a director (or other position equivalent to General Electric Company’s EB) even though he
is not employed at that level on the date his Service terminates.
 
 2. Amount of Benefit.
 
 A.Definitions. For purposes of this Section 2, the following terms have the following meanings:
Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit. The annual equivalent of the maximum possible Primary Insurance Amount payable, after reduction
for early retirement, as an old-age benefit to an employee who retired at age 62 on January 1 of the calendar year in which occurred the Employee’s actual
date of retirement or death, whichever is earlier. The Company shall determine the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit in accordance with the Social
Security Act in effect at the end of the calendar year preceding such January 1.
If an Employee has less than 35 years of Credited Service, the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit determined under the above paragraph
is multiplied by a factor, the numerator of which is the number of years of the Employees’ Credited Service to his or her date of retirement or death, or
December 31. 2019, whichever is earlier, and the denominator of which is 35.
The Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit shall be adjusted to include any social security, severance, or similar benefit provided under
foreign law or regulations as the Committee may prescribe by rules and regulations.
Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan. The sum of:
 
 (1) (i) the annual normal, early or late retirement benefit under Article V of the Qualified Pension Plan, including the Personal Pension
Account (excluding the regular supplement under Article V(4) of the Qualified Pension Plan), or (ii) the normal, optional or disability
retirement benefit under the RIP II or KAPL Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan, less
 
 (2) to the extent the Committee so determines, the benefit payable under any other pension plan contract, or policy of the Plan Sponsor
(whether qualified or non-qualified), or government program attributable to periods of service for which Credited Service is granted by
the Committee for the determination of the benefit under this Plan or is credited by the Qualified Pension. All such amounts shall be
determined before applying any reduction factors for Early, Optional or Disability Retirement, for election of any optional form of
Pension at retirement, a qualified domestic relations order(s), if any, or in connection with any other adjustment or supplement made
pursuant to the Qualified Pension Plan or any other pension plan.
For purposes of this paragraph, the Employee’s Pension shall include the Personal Pension Account Annuity payable to the Employee or the Employee’s
spouse on the date of the Employee’s retirement or death, regardless of whether such annuity commenced on such date.
Annual Retirement Income. For Employees who retire or die in active Service on or after April 5, 1993, the amount determined by multiplying
1.75% of Average Annual Compensation by the number of years of Credited Service completed at the date of retirement or death, or December 31, 2019,
whichever is earlier.
Average Annual Compensation. One-third of the Employee’s Compensation for the highest consecutive three years during the last 10 years
immediately preceding his date of retirement or death, whichever is earlier. In computing Average Annual Compensation, normal straight-time earnings shall
be substituted for actual Compensation for any month in which such normal straight-time earnings are greater. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Average
Annual Compensation will be frozen effective as of January 1, 2016. Accordingly, for purposes of determining Average Annual Compensation, the term
“years” above shall not include any period after December 31, 2015, and Average Annual Compensation shall not include amounts earned for or relating to
any period after December, 31, 2015.
Compensation. Salary (including any deferred salary approved by the Committee as compensation for purposes of this Plan) plus:
 
 (1) For persons then eligible for Incentive Compensation, the total amount of any Management Incentive Compensation Plan earnings,
unless such Incentive Compensation is excluded by the Board or a committee thereof.
 (2) For persons who would then have been eligible for Incentive Compensation if they had not been participants in a Sales Commission Plan
or other variable compensation plan, the total amount of sales commissions (or other variable compensation earned unless such
compensation is excluded by the Board or a committee thereof);
 
 (3) For all other persons, the sales commissions and other variable compensation earned to the extent such earnings were then included under
the Qualified Pension Plan, plus any amounts (other than salary and those mentioned in clauses (1) through (3) above) which were then
included as compensation under the Qualified Pension Plan except any amounts which the Committee may exclude from the computation
of “Compensation” and subject to the powers of the Committee with respect to payment of benefits.
The Committee shall specify the basis for determining an Employee’s Compensation for any portion of the three years used to compute the Employee’s
Average Annual Compensation during which the Employee was not employed by an employer participating in this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Compensation will be frozen effective as of January 1, 2016. Accordingly, Compensation shall not include amounts earned for or relating to any period after
December, 31, 2015.
Credited Service. Credited Service has the same meaning as in the Qualified Pension Plan. For periods before January 1, 1976, Credited Service
as a full-time Employee also includes all Service credited under the Qualified Pension Plan for any period during which the employee was a full-time
Employee for purposes of the Qualified Pension Plan. Credited Service also includes:
 
 (1) Any period of Service with the Company or an Affiliate as the Committee may otherwise provide by rules and regulations issued with
respect to this Plan; and
 
 (2) Any period of service with another employer as the Board may approve, if any conditions specified in such approval have been met.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant’s Credited Service shall be frozen effective January 1, 2020, and no Participant shall accrue further Credited
Service under this Plan with respect to any period after December 31, 2019.
B. Normal Retirement Benefit. Subject to the limitations in Section G, the benefit payable to an eligible Employee who retires on or after his or her
normal retirement date under the Plan, shall be the excess, if any, of the employee’s Annual Retirement Income, over the sum of:
 
 (1) The Employee’s Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan (including the Personal Pension Account Annuity and
excluding any supplements payable under the Qualified Pension Plan) (calculated as a five-year certain annuity),
 (2)  1⁄2 of the Employee’s Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit,
 
 (3) the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan.
C. Early, Optional or Disability Retirement. Subject to the limitations in Section G, the benefit payable to an eligible Employee who, after reaching age
60, retires on an optional retirement date under the Qualified Pension Plan shall be computed in the manner provided by Section B (for an employee retiring
on his or her normal retirement date) but taking into account only Credited Service and Average Annual Compensation to the actual date of optional
retirement. The annual benefit payable to an eligible Employee who, after reaching age 55 (but before reaching age 60) retires under the early retirement
provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan shall equal the amount in section B but taking into account only Credited Service and Average Annual Compensation
to the Employee’s actual termination of employment and reduced for early retirement using the early retirement reduction factor under Article V(2) of the
Qualified Pension Plan.
The annual benefit payable to an eligible Employee who has satisfied the eligibility requirements to receive a Disability Pension under the RIP II or
KAPL Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan shall be computed in the manner provided by Section B (for an Employee retiring on his normal retirement date)
taking into account only Credited Service and Average Annual Compensation to the actual date of disability retirement and not reduced for the Disability
Supplement in the RIP II or KAPL Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan. In the case of an eligible Employee whose date of retirement precedes the first day
of the month after reaching age 60 the Plan benefit shall then be reduced by 12%.
If the Disability Pension payable to the Employee under the Qualified Pension Plan is discontinued as a result of the Employee’s disability ceasing
before the Employee reaches age 60, the benefit provided under this Section C. shall also be discontinued.
D. Special Benefit Protection for Certain Employees. A former Employee whose Service with the Company is terminated on or after December 31,
1994, and after completing 25 or more years of Vesting Service, who does not withdraw his required or voluntary contributions from the Qualified Pension
Plan before retirement, shall be eligible for a benefit under this Plan commencing upon his or her retirement under the Qualified Pension Plan after reaching
age 60 if:
 
 (1) the Employee’s Service is terminated for transfer to a successor employer and
 
 (2) the Employee does not retire under the Qualified Pension Plan until the later of (1) termination of service with the successor employer
and (2) the first of the month after reaching age 60.
In determining the benefit under this Plan, the Average Annual Compensation shall be based on the last 120 completed months with the successor employer
before the Employee’s Service termination date and the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit shall be determined as though the Employee’s retirement
date was the date of termination. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “120 completed months” shall not include any period after December 31, 2015.
E. Survivor Benefits. Subject to Section F.(b), if a survivor benefit applies with respect to the past and future service annuity portion of an Employee’s
Annual Pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan, such survivor benefit shall automatically apply to any benefit which he or she may be eligible
under this Plan. The Employee’s benefit shall be adjusted and paid in the same manner as such pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan is adjusted
and paid on account of such survivor benefit.
F. Payments Upon Death.
(a) If an eligible Employee dies in active Service, or following retirement with a benefit from this Plan, and a death benefit (other than a return of
Employee contributions with interest including an Employee’s Personal and Voluntary Pension Account) is payable to the beneficiary or Surviving
Spouse of such Employee under the Qualified Pension Plan, a death benefit shall also be payable to the beneficiary or Surviving Spouse under this Plan
as follows:
 
 (1) Any such death benefit payable to a surviving spouse under this Plan shall equal 50% of the Employee’s Annual Retirement Income
under this Plan reduced by (1) 100% of the Employee’s preretirement surviving spouse benefit payable or other lump sum benefit under
the Qualified Pension Plan, (2) 25% of the Employee’s Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit, (3) the Employee’s Personal Pension
Account benefit, and (4) the benefit payable under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan. Payments to the
surviving spouse shall commence on the later of: (1) the Employee’s 55th birthday, or (2) the Employee’s date of death.
 
 (2) Any such death benefit payable to a surviving spouse under this Plan shall take into account only Credited Service and Average Annual
Compensation to the earlier of the Employee’s death or termination of employment and will be reduced for early retirement using the
early retirement reduction factors under Article V(2) of the Qualified Pension Plan.
 
 (3) Any such benefit payable to a surviving spouse shall be paid at the same time as the Qualified Pension Plan and will be paid in
accordance with the payment provisions of the RIP II or KAPL Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan. If benefits from the Qualified
Pension Plan are paid under the payment provisions of the RIP II or KAPL Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan, then benefits from this
Plan will be paid in the same payment form.
(b) In lieu of the benefit otherwise payable to a beneficiary or surviving spouse under Section E. or paragraph (a) of this Section, an Employee may
elect to have all or any portion of such benefit (or the equivalent value of all or any portion) paid to the beneficiary designated in the employee’s
election in any of the following forms:
 
 (1) An annuity for the spouse’s remaining lifetime. If the beneficiary dies before the spouse, the remaining benefit shall be paid as provided
in the employee’s election. In the absence of any such provision, the equivalent value of the remaining payments shall be paid to the
beneficiary’s estate, if any, otherwise to the beneficiary’s Personal Representative.
 
 (2) An annuity for the beneficiary’s remaining lifetime. If any annuity otherwise payable under this item (2) is less than $5,000 annually, the
equivalent value shall be paid instead to the beneficiary in a lump sum.
 
 (3) A lump sum.
Any such election must be made in writing to the Qualified Pension Plan Administrator prior to the Employee’s death, and becomes effective when the
Qualified Pension Plan Administrator receives it. For purposes of this election, an Employee may designate as his beneficiary only his estate, his former
spouse, or a member of his immediate family.
For the purpose of determining the benefit conversions required to provide the benefit payments referred to above, the interest rate assumption shall be
the interest rate used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation at the beginning of the year in which the Employee’s death occurs, in valuing immediate
annuities for terminating single employer trusteed plans, and the mortality assumption shall be based on the UP-1984 Mortality Table.
G. Limitations on Benefits.
(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the sum of:
 
 (1) The annual benefit (calculated before applying any reductions for early retirement or additions for any supplements payable under the
Qualified Pension Plan, and prior to any calculation for disability retirement reductions) otherwise payable to an Employee under this
Plan;
 
 (2) The Employee’s Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan (including the Personal Pension Account Annuity) (calculated
as a five-year certain annuity);
 (3) 100% of the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit before any adjustment for less than 35 years of Pension Benefit Service;
 
 (4) the Employee’s annual benefit under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan; and
to the extent the Committee so determines, the benefit payable under any other pension plan contract, or policy of the Plan Sponsor (whether qualified
or non-qualified), or government program attributable to periods of service for which Credited Service is granted by the Committee for the
determination of the benefit under this Plan or is credited by the Qualified Pension exceeds 60% of his or her Annual Average Compensation, the
benefit payable under this Plan shall be reduced by the amount of the excess.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, the amount of the benefit payable and any death benefit payable to or on behalf of any
Employee who is or was an Officer of the Company on the date of his retirement or death, whichever is earlier, shall be determined according to such
general rules and regulations as a Committee appointed by the Board of Directors may adopt, subject to the limitation that any such benefit or death
benefit may not exceed the amount which would be payable under this Plan in the absence of such rules and regulations.
H. Adjustments Following Retirement. If the Pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Employee is increased following the Employee’s
retirement as a result of a general increase in the Pensions payable to retired employees under that plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan unless
the Committee makes such determination.
I. Non-duplication of Benefits. Benefits under this Article III are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit under the Qualified Pension
Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the Qualified Pension Plan with the special
adjustments described above. To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced benefit described above
shall be calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified Pension Plan
and further reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan. Participants have no right to duplicate
benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems
necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
J. Plan Freeze. Notwithstanding anything in this Article III to the contrary, base rate of pay, bonuses or other incentive compensation, or other amounts
earned for or relating to the period after December 31, 2015, shall not be used in determining benefits under the Plan, and service after December 31, 2019,
shall not be considered, deemed to be, or otherwise treated as Credited Service or similar benefit accrual service in determining benefits payable under the
Plan.
ARTICLE IV
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1. Vesting. Except as provided in Article V, and subject to the Company’s right to discontinue the Plan as provided in Article VI, a Participant shall
have a non-forfeitable interest in benefits payable under this Plan to the same extent as benefits are vested under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan. As
provided in Article V, if a Participant acquires a right to receive payments under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured
general creditor of the Company.
2. Form of Payment. Benefits shall be paid at the same time as the Qualified Pension Plan and will be paid in accordance with the payment provisions
of the RIP II or KAPL Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan. If benefits from the Qualified Pension Plan are paid under the payment provisions of the RIP II
or KAPL Annex, then benefits from this Plan will be paid in the same payment form.
If an Employee’s pension benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan is suspended for any month in accordance with the re-employment provisions
thereof, the Employee’s benefit under this Plan for that month shall likewise be suspended.
Cash-out of Small Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, if the Value of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary under this
Plan does not exceed the amount that may be distributed without consent under Section 411(a)(11) of the Code, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump
sum payment in full discharge of all liabilities with respect to such benefits. For purposes of this Section, Value shall be determined as of the Participant’s
termination of employment, and shall mean the present value of a Participant’s or Beneficiary’s benefits based upon the applicable mortality table and
applicable interest rate in Code section 417(e)(3)(ii) for the calendar month preceding the Plan Year in which the termination of employment occurs.
3. Deductibility of Payments. In the event that the payment of benefits under Section 2 would prevent the Company from claiming an income tax
deduction with respect to any portion of the benefits paid, the Committee shall have the right to modify the form and timing of distributions as necessary to
maximize the Company’s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a modified distribution schedule, the Committee shall undertake to have
distributions made at such times and in such amounts as most closely approximate the payment method described in Section 2, consistent with the objective
of maximum deductibility for the Company. The Committee shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’s accrued benefit under this Plan or to pay
aggregate benefits less than the Participant’s accrued benefit in the event that all or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the Company.
4. Change of Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Committee determines in good faith, based on consultation with counsel, that
the federal income tax treatment or legal status of this Plan has or may be adversely affected by a change in the Code, Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, or other applicable law or by an administrative or judicial construction thereof, the Committee may direct that the benefits of
affected Participants or of all Participants be distributed as soon as practicable after such determination is made, to the extent deemed necessary or advisable
by the Committee to cure or mitigate the consequences, or possible consequences of, such change in law or interpretation thereof.
5. Acceleration upon Change in Control.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the accrued benefit of each Participant shall be distributed in a single lump sum within fifteen
(15) calendar days following a “Change in Control.”
For purposes of this Plan, a Change in Control shall include and be deemed to occur upon the following events:
 
 (a)A tender offer or exchange offer is consummated for the ownership of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined
voting power of the Company’s then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
 
 (b)The Company is merged, combined, consolidated, recapitalized or otherwise reorganized with one or more other entities that are not Subsidiaries
and, as a result of the merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization or other reorganization, less than 75% of the outstanding voting
securities of the surviving or resulting corporation shall immediately after the event be owned in the aggregate by the stockholders of the
Company (directly or indirectly), determined on the basis of record ownership as of the date of determination of holders entitled to vote on the
action (or in the absence of a vote, the day immediately prior to the event).
 
 (c)Any person (as this term is used in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, but excluding any person described in and satisfying the
conditions of Rule 13d-1(b)(1) thereunder), becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities
entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
 (d)At any time within any period of two years after a tender offer, merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization, or other reorganization or a
contested election, or any combination of these events, the “Incumbent Directors” shall cease to constitute at least a majority of the authorized
number of members of the Board. For purposes hereof, “Incumbent Directors” shall mean the persons who were members of the Board
immediately before the first of these events and the persons who were elected or nominated as their successors or pursuant to increases in the size
of the Board by a vote of at least three-fourths of the Board members who were then Board members (or successors or additional members so
elected or nominated).
 
 (e)The stockholders of the Company approve a plan of liquidation and dissolution or the sale or transfer of substantially all of the Company’s
business and/or assets as an entirety to an entity that is not a Subsidiary.
This Section 5 shall apply only to a Change in Control of Lockheed Martin Corporation and shall not cause immediate payout of benefits under
this Plan in any transaction involving the Company’s sale, liquidation, merger, or other disposition of any subsidiary.
The Committee may cancel or modify this Section 5 at any time prior to a Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, this Section 5
shall remain in force and effect, and shall not be subject to cancellation or modification for a period of five years, and any defined term used in Section 5 shall
not, for purposes of Section 5, be subject to cancellation or modification during the five year period.
6. Tax Withholding. To the extent required by law, the Company shall withhold from benefit payments hereunder any Federal, state, or local income or
payroll taxes required to be withheld and shall furnish the recipient and the applicable government agency or agencies with such reports, statements, or
information as may be legally required. No benefit payments shall be made to the Participant until the withholding obligation for taxes under Code sections
3101(a) and 3101(b) has been satisfied with respect to the Participant.
7. Retiree Medical Withholding. A Participant may direct the Company to withhold from the Participant’s benefit payments hereunder all or a portion
of the amount that the Participant is required to pay for Company-provided retiree medical coverage.
ARTICLE V
EXTENT OF PARTICIPANTS’ RIGHTS
1. Unfunded Status of Plan. This Plan constitutes a mere contractual promise by the Company to make payments in the future, and each Participant’s
rights shall be those of a general, unsecured creditor of the Company. No Participant shall have any beneficial interest in any specific assets that the Company
may hold or set aside in connection with this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to assist the Company in meeting its obligations under this Plan, the
Company may set aside assets in a trust or trusts described in Revenue Procedure 92-64, 1992-2 C.B. 422, and the Company may direct that its obligations
under this Plan be satisfied by payments out of such trust or trusts. The assets of any such trust will remain subject to the claims of the general creditors of the
Company. It is the Company’s intention that the Plan be unfunded for Federal income tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974.
2. Nonalienability of Benefits. A Participant’s rights under this Plan shall not be assignable or transferable and any purported transfer, assignment,
pledge or other encumbrance or attachment of any payments or benefits under this Plan, or any interest therein shall not be permitted or recognized, other than
the designation of, or passage of payment rights to, a Beneficiary or transfer of an interest in this Plan to a Participant’s former spouse incident to divorce
under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.
3. Forfeiture. If, following the date on which a Participant shall retire under this Plan, a Participant shall engage in the operation or management of a
business, whether as owner, stockholder, partner, officer, employee, consultant, or otherwise, which at such time is in competition with the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, or shall disclose to unauthorized persons information relative to the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which the Participant
shall have reason to believe is confidential, or otherwise act, or conduct oneself, in a manner which the Participant shall have reason to believe is contrary to
the best interest of the Company, or shall be found by the Committee to have committed an act during the term of the Participant’s employment which would
have justified the Participant being discharged for cause, the Participant’s retirement benefit under this Plan shall terminate. Application of this Section will
be at the discretion of the Committee.
ARTICLE VI
AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION
1. Amendment. The Board or its authorized delegate may amend, modify, suspend or discontinue this Plan at any time subject to any shareholder
approval that may be required under applicable law, provided, however, that no such amendment shall have the effect of reducing a Participant’s accrued
benefit or postponing the time when a Participant is entitled to receive a distribution of his accrued benefit unless each affected Participant consents to such
change.
2. Termination. The Board reserves the right to terminate this Plan at any time and to pay all Participants their accrued benefits in a lump sum or to
make other provisions for the payment of benefits (e.g. purchase of annuities) immediately following such termination or at such time thereafter as the Board
may determine.
3. Transfer of Liability. The Board reserves the right to transfer to another entity all of the obligations of Company with respect to a Participant under
this Plan if such entity agrees pursuant to a binding written agreement with the Company or its subsidiaries to assume all of the obligations of the Company
under this Plan with respect to such Participant.
4. Merger. The Board reserves the right to merge all or part of this Plan with or into another plan, provided (1) such other plan preserves all of the
obligations of the Company under this Plan with respect to such Participant and (2) each Participant in the Plan would (if the Plan then terminated) receive a
benefit immediately after the merger which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger (if the
Plan had then terminated).
ARTICLE VII
ADMINISTRATION
1. The Committee. This Plan shall be administered by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board or such other
committee of the Board as may be designated by the Board. The members of the Committee shall be designated by the Board. A majority of the members of
the Committee (but not fewer than two) shall constitute a quorum. The vote of a majority of a quorum or the unanimous written consent of the Committee
shall constitute action by the Committee. The Committee and its delegates (including the Claims Administrator) shall have full discretion to construe and
interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan, which interpretation or construction shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties, including but not
limited to the Company and any Participant or Beneficiary, except as otherwise provided by law. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5, the Committee
delegates the authority to adjudicate claims to the Pension Plans Administration Committee.
2. Delegation and Reliance. The Committee may delegate to the officers or employees of the Company the authority to execute and deliver those
instruments and documents, to do all acts and things, and to take all other steps deemed necessary, advisable or convenient for the effective administration of
this Plan in accordance with its terms and purpose. In making any determination or in taking or not taking any action under this Plan, the Committee
or its delegate may obtain and rely upon the advice of experts, including professional advisors to the Company. No member of the Committee or officer of the
Company who is a Participant hereunder may participate in any decision specifically relating to his or her individual rights or benefits under the Plan.
3. Exculpation and Indemnity. Neither the Company nor any member of the Board or of the Committee, nor any other person participating in any
determination of any question under this Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, shall have any liability to any party for any action
taken or not taken in good faith under this Plan or for the failure of the Plan or any Participant’s rights under the Plan to achieve intended tax consequences, or
to comply with any other law, compliance with which is not required on the part of the Company.
4. Facility of Payment. If a minor, person declared incompetent, or person incapable of handling the disposition of his or her property is entitled to
receive a benefit, make an application, or make an election hereunder, the Committee or the Claims Administrator may direct that such benefits be paid to, or
such application or election be made by, the guardian, legal representative, or person having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent, or incapable
person. Any payment made, application allowed, or election implemented in accordance with this Section shall completely discharge the Company and the
Committee from all liability with respect thereto.
5. Proof of Claims. The Committee or the Claims Administrator may require proof of the death, disability, incompetency, minority, or incapacity of any
Participant or Beneficiary and of the right of a person to receive any benefit or make any application or election.
6. Claim Procedures. The procedures when a claim under this Plan is wholly or partially denied by the Claims Administrator are as follows:
 
 (a)The Claims Administrator shall, within 90 days after receipt of a claim, furnish to claimant a written notice setting forth, in a manner calculated
to be understood by claimant: (1) the specific reason or reasons for the denial; (2) specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the
denial is based; (3) a description of any additional materials or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of
why such material or information is necessary; (4) an explanation of the steps to be taken if the claimant wishes to have the denial reviewed; and
(5) a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse determination on review. The 90
day period may be extended for not more than an additional 90 days if special circumstances make such an extension necessary. The Claims
Administrator shall give the claimant, before the end of the initial 90 day period, a written notice of such extension, stating such special
circumstances and the date by which the Claims Administrator expects to render a decision.
 (b)By a written application filed with the Claims Administrator within 60 days after receipt by claimant of the written notice described in paragraph
(a), the claimant or his duly authorized representative may request review of the denial of his claim.
 
 (c)In connection with such review, the claimant or his duly authorized representative may submit issues, comments, documents, records and other
information relating to the claim for benefits to the Claims Administrator. In addition, the claimant will be provided, upon request and free of
charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, or other information “relevant” to claimant’s claim for benefits. A document,
record, or other information is “relevant” if it: (1) was relied upon in making the benefit determination; (2) was submitted, considered or
generated in the course of making the benefit determination, without regard to whether such document, record or information was relied upon in
making the benefit determination; or (3) demonstrates compliance with administrative processes and safeguards required under federal law.
 
 (d)The Plan will provide an impartial review that takes into account all comments, records and other information submitted by the claimant relating
to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The Claims
Administrator shall make a decision and furnish such decision in writing to the claimant within 60 days after receipt by the Claims Administrator
of the request for review. This period may be extended to not more than 120 days after such receipt if special circumstances make such an
extension necessary. The claimant will be notified in writing prior to the expiration of the original 60 day period if such an extension is required,
and such notice will include the reason for the extension and the date by which it is expected that a decision will be reached. The decision on
review shall be in writing, set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include: (1) the specific reasons for the
decision; (2) specific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based; (3) a statement that the claimant is entitled to
receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, and other information “relevant” to the
claimant’s claim for benefits; (4) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an
explanation of why such material or information is necessary; (5) a statement describing any voluntary appeal procedures and the claimant’s right
to obtain information about such procedures, if any; and (6) a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of
ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review.
 
 (e)If in the event that the reviewing committee must make a determination of disability in order to decide a claim, the reviewing committee shall
follow the special claims procedures for disability benefits described in Department of Labor Regulation section 2560.503-1(d). The reviewing
committee shall render a decision within a reasonable time (not to exceed 90 days) after the claimant’s request for review, rather than within 120
days as set forth in the above paragraph.
 (f)The Claims Administrator shall be the Lockheed Martin Corporation Pension Plans Administrative Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
with respect to claims and appeals brought by elected officers of the Company, the Claims Administrator shall be the Committee.

Eligible Employee was paid by the Company for at least one day. For the purposes of this Section 1(q), no week may be counted twice. For the
avoidance of doubt, (I) no Eligible Employee who, at the time of the Executive Layoff Event, works for Lockheed Martin Investment

less than a full year of service, in which case the Years of Service will be calculated as one year;
 
 (ii) Certain Periods of Leave. Time periods of leave during the Employee’s employment that do not or would not qualify for credited service
under the pension plan applicable to the Eligible Employee will be deducted from the total period of employment to calculate the Eligible

terminated or will terminate on account of Executive Layoff Event (including acceptance of a separation window program offered by the
Company that incorporates this Plan or a portion thereof by reference). In the case of an Officer, this determination will be made by the
Committee in its sole discretion.
 
4. Exceptions To Coverage As An Executive Layoff Event. Notwithstanding Section 3 or anything else to the contrary, an Employee’s Executive Layoff
Event will not be considered to have occurred and the Employee will not be entitled to a Severance Benefit if:

terms and conditions as the Supplemental Severance Benefit within 90 days following the Eligible Employee’s
(a) Executive Layoff Event, and (b) execution of a release of claims and the expiration of any applicable
revocation period thereunder following such Executive Layoff Event, but in no event later than the March 15
immediately following the year in which the Eligible Employee’s Executive Layoff Event occurs; provided
that, to the extent that a payment is subject to Code section 409A, if the payment period or the period during
which the employee may consider whether to execute the release spans two taxable years, the payment shall be
made in the later taxable year. The elections described in this Section 5(c)(iii) shall be made at such time and
in such manner as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. If no such election is made, the Eligible
Employee shall remain eligible for outplacement and relocation services as set forth in Section 5(c)(ii), and the
amounts paid by the Company for such services shall be reported as taxable income to the Eligible Employee.
 
 (d)Maximum Benefit Payable – Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if the total amount of benefits, including Plan benefits,
provided to an Eligible Employee would result in an “excess parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, the Company, in its sole discretion, may reduce the benefits provided under the Plan so that the total payment will not
result in an excess parachute payment to the Eligible Employee.
 
7
 (e)Specified Employees – The benefits under this Plan are intended to meet the exceptions under Code section 409A for short term deferrals,
involuntary severance payments, and/or benefits payable within a limited time after separation from service. However, to the extent any benefit
payable under this Plan to an Eligible Employee who is a “specified employee” (as defined in Code section 409A) is subject to Code
section 409A, such benefit payment shall be delayed until 6 months following the month in which the Eligible Employee has a Termination of
Employment from the Company.
 
6. Further Conditions on Payment of Severance Benefit.
 
 (a)The Company retains the right to condition payment of a Basic Severance Benefit or Supplemental Severance Benefit upon the Eligible
Employee maintaining fully satisfactory work performance until the effective date of the Eligible Employee’s Executive Layoff Event as agreed
to by the Company, including the Eligible Employee’s faithful performance of any remaining obligations the Eligible Employee may owe to the
Company such as prompt reimbursement to the Company for cash advances and debit balances and the return of all Company property. To the
extent the Eligible Employee fails to maintain fully satisfactory work performance until the effective date of the Eligible Employee’s Executive
Layoff Event, such Eligible Employee shall forfeit his or her Basic Severance Benefit and/or Supplemental Severance Benefit, in their entirety, to
the extent of any such benefit.
 
 (b)In the event an Eligible Employee who is entitled to a Supplemental Severance Benefit becomes employed by the Company (or an Affiliate) prior
to the first anniversary of his or her Executive Layoff Event, the Eligible Employee shall be obligated to repay to the Company an amount equal
to the amount of the Employee’s Supplemental Severance Benefit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of weeks
(capped at 52) in the one-year period following the Employee’s termination of employment during which the Employee is employed by the
Company and the denominator of which is fifty-two (52).
 
 (c)If an Eligible Employee dies after his or her Termination of Employment, but before payment of a Basic Severance Benefit is made, the Basic
Severance Benefit will be paid to his or her estate. If an Eligible Employee dies after he or she has signed the release of claims and the release of
claims is delivered to the Company within the time limit provided in Section 5(b) of the Plan, then the Supplemental Severance Benefit will be
paid to his or her estate in accordance with the timing rules in Section 5(d).
 
 (d)The benefits under the Plan are in lieu of, and not in addition to, any other severance or similar benefits for which the Eligible Employee may be
eligible under any Company plan, policy, agreement or arrangement (including but not limited to the Salaried Employee Plan). As a condition to
receiving a benefit under the Plan, the Company may require that the Eligible Employee waive rights under all other plans, policies, agreements
or arrangements providing severance or similar benefits or may reduce the amount payable under the Plan by the amount payable under any other
such plan policy, agreement or arrangement. In no event shall the Company’s administration of the Plan in accordance with the preceding
sentence operate to delay payment of a benefit under the Plan to an Eligible Employee beyond March 15th immediately following the year in
which such Eligible Employee’s Executive Layoff Event occurs.
 
8
7. Administration. The Company may appoint or employ such persons as it deems necessary to render advice with respect to any responsibility of the
Company under the Plan. The Committee, with respect to Officers, and the Savings Plan Administrative Committee, with respect to all other
Employees shall determine the eligibility of any Employee to participate in the Plan and the right of any Employee to any benefit and the amount of any
benefit payable under the Plan to any individual. The Committee and the Savings Plan Administrative Committee shall have the discretionary authority
to interpret any term of the Plan.
 
8. Claims Procedure.
 
 (a)The Senior Vice President, Human Resources or his or her delegate shall notify each Eligible Employee who has been determined to have
incurred an Executive Layoff Event and who is eligible to receive benefits under the Plan and shall provide any forms required in connection with
application for such benefits. If any Employee disagrees with determination of his or her benefits, the Employee may submit a written statement
to the Claims Administrator describing the basis of the claim for benefits, together with any forms required in connection with application for a
benefit, at any time within the 120 day period following the date on which the Employee claims to have become entitled to the Basic Severance
Benefits or the Supplemental Severance Benefits.
 
 (b)The procedures when a claim under the Plan is wholly or partially denied are as follows:
 
 (i) The Claims Administrator shall, within 90 days after receipt of a claim, furnish to claimant a written notice setting forth, in a manner
calculated to be understood by claimant: (1) the specific reason or reasons for the denial; (2) specific reference to pertinent Plan
provisions on which the denial is based; (3) a description of any additional materials or information necessary for the claimant to perfect
the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; (4) an explanation of the steps to be taken if the claimant
wishes to have the denial reviewed; and (5) a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA
following an adverse determination on review. The 90 day period may be extended for not more than an additional 90 days if special
circumstances make such an extension necessary. The Claims Administrator shall give the claimant, before the end of the initial 90 day
period, a written notice of such extension, stating such special circumstances and the date by which the Claims Administrator expects to
render a decision.
 
 (ii) By a written application filed with the Claims Administrator within 60 days after receipt by claimant of the written notice described in
paragraph (a), the claimant or his or her duly authorized representative may request review of the denial of his or her claim by the Claims
Administrator.
 
 (iii) In connection with review by the Claims Administrator, the claimant or his duly authorized representative may submit issues, comments,
documents, records and other information relating to the claim for benefits under the Plan to the Claims Administrator. In addition, the
claimant will be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, or other
information “relevant” to claimant’s claim for benefits. A document, record, or other information is “relevant” if it: (1) was relied upon in
making the benefit determination;
 
9
 (2) was submitted, considered or generated in the course of making the benefit determination, without regard to whether such document,
record or information was relied upon in making the benefit determination; or (3) demonstrates compliance with administrative processes
and safeguards required under federal law.
 
 (iv) The Claims Administrator will provide an impartial review that takes into account all comments, records and other information submitted
by the claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit
determination. The Claims Administrator shall make a decision and furnish such decision in writing to the claimant within 60 days after
receipt by the Claims Administrator of the request for review. This period may be extended by the Claims Administrator to not more than
120 days after such receipt if special circumstances make such an extension necessary. The claimant will be notified in writing prior to
the expiration of the original 60-day period if such an extension is required, and such notice will include the reason for the extension and
the date by which it is expected that a decision will be reached. The decision on review shall be in writing, set forth in a manner
calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include: (1) the specific reasons for the decision; (2) specific reference to the
pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based; (3) a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of
charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, and other information “relevant” to the claimant’s claim for benefits;
(4) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such
material or information is necessary; (5) a statement describing any voluntary appeal procedures and the claimant’s right to obtain
information about such procedures, if any; and (6) a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of
ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review. In the event that the Claims Administrator must make a determination of
disability in order to decide a claim, the Claims Administrator shall follow the special claims procedures for disability benefits described
in Department of Labor Regulation section 2560.503-1(d). The Claims Administrator shall render a decision within a reasonable time
(not to exceed 90 days) after the claimant’s request for review, rather than within 120 days as set forth in the above paragraph.
 
 (v) In filing a claim or appeal under this Section 8, an Employee at his or her option may act through an authorized representative.
 
9. Funding. The Plan shall not be funded through a trust, insurance contract or otherwise, and all benefit payments from the Plan shall be made from the
general assets of the Company. Accordingly, an Employee shall not have any claim against specific assets of the Company, and shall be only a general
creditor, with respect to any rights he/she may have under the Plan.
 
10.Amendment and Termination of Plan. The Plan may be amended, in whole or in part, at any time by action of the Committee or by any authorized
delegate, without notice, except that any amendment that would change the eligibility requirements or the amount of benefits payable under the Plan
must be approved by the Committee. The Plan may be terminated by action of the Committee at any time. Upon termination of the Plan, the Company
shall have no further liability hereunder, and all Plan benefits (including any amounts payable to Employees who separated from service before the date
of Plan termination) shall cease.
 
10
11.No Assignment. No Basic Severance Benefit or Supplemental Severance Benefit payable under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged as a
security for indebtedness or otherwise encumbered, or subjected to any legal process for the payment of any claim against an Employee.
 
12.Relationship to Other Benefits. An Employee’s Basic Severance Benefit or Supplemental Severance Benefit shall not be taken into account to
increase any benefits provided (or to continue coverage) under any other plan, policy, or arrangement of the Company or any Affiliate, except as
otherwise expressly provided in writing in the other plan, policy, or arrangement, including accelerating vesting or other rights under the Lockheed
Martin Corporation Amended and Restated Incentive Performance Award Plan (or any successor plan).
 
13.Governing Law. Except to the extent preempted by Federal law, the Plan shall be construed, administered and enforced according to the laws of the
State of Maryland, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, payments under this Award
Agreement shall be made at a time and in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
The Plan was approved by the Management Development and Compensation Committee and was originally effective as of January 1, 2008.
Amendments to the Plan are effective as of the date(s) set forth above.

contemporaneous with this PECA, is entered into in consideration of the payment (“Severance Payment”) to be made to me under the Lockheed Martin

termination of employment with the Company (“Termination Date”), I will not, directly or indirectly, be employed by, provide services to, or advise a
“Restricted Company” (as defined in Section 6 below), whether as an employee, advisor, director, officer, partner or consultant, or in any other position,
function or role that, in any such case,
 
 (i)oversees, controls or affects the design, operation, research, manufacture, marketing, sale or distribution of “Competitive Products
or Services” (as defined in Section 6 below) of or by the Restricted Company, or
 
 (ii)would involve a substantial risk that the “Confidential or Proprietary Information” (as defined in Section 1(c) below) of the
Company (including but not limited to technical information or intellectual property, strategic plans, information relating to pricing
offered to the Company by vendors or suppliers or to prices charged or pricing contemplated to be charged by the Company,
information relating to employee performance, promotions or identification for promotion, or information relating to the
Company’s cost base) could be used to the disadvantage of the Company.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, including but not limited to any applicable rules governing attorney conduct (such as the ABA Model
Rules of Professional Conduct and state versions thereof), Sections 1(a)(i) and (ii) and Section 1(b) relating to non-solicitation, shall apply to
individuals who are employed by the Corporation in an attorney position and whose occupation during the two-year period following employment with
the Corporation does not include practicing law.
 
12
In lieu of Section 1(a)(i) and (ii), as well as Section 1(b) relating to non-solicitation, the following Section 1(a)(iii) shall apply to individuals who
are employed by the Corporation in an attorney position, and whose occupation during the two-year period following employment with the Corporation
includes practicing law.
 
 (iii)Post-employment Activity As a Lawyer – I acknowledge that as counsel to the Corporation, I owe ethical and fiduciary obligations
to the Corporation and that at least some of these obligations will continue even after my Termination Date with the Corporation. I
agree that after my Termination Date I will comply fully with all applicable ethical and fiduciary obligations that I owe to the
Corporation. To the extent permitted by applicable law, including but not limited to any applicable rules governing attorney
conduct, I agree that I will not:

interests are materially adverse to the Corporation; or
 
 b. Disclose confidential information relating to my representation of the Corporation, including the disclosure of information
that is to the disadvantage of the Corporation, except for information that is or becomes generally known.
The Corporation’s Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary or the General Tax Counsel, as applicable, will determine in
his or her discretion whether an individual is employed by the Corporation in an attorney position.
(b) Non-Solicit – Without the express written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (or the Committee with respect to the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company), during the two-year period following the Termination Date, I will not (i) interfere with any contractual relationship
between the Company and any customer, supplier, distributor or manufacturer of or to the Company to the detriment of the Company or (ii) induce or attempt
to induce any person who is an employee of the Company to perform work or services for any entity other than the Company.
(c) Protection of Proprietary Information – Except to the extent required by law, following my Termination Date, I will have a continuing

confidential the “Confidential or Proprietary Information” (as defined below) of the Company or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, related companies, joint
ventures, partnerships, customers, suppliers, partners, contractors or agents, in each case in accordance with the terms of such agreements. I will not use or
disclose or allow the use or disclosure by others to any person or entity of Confidential or Proprietary Information of the Company or others to which I had
access or that I was responsible for creating or overseeing during my employment with the Company. In the event I become legally compelled (by deposition,
interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or otherwise) to disclose any proprietary or confidential information, I will
 
13
immediately notify the Company’s Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary as to the existence of the obligation and will cooperate
with any reasonable request by the Company for assistance in seeking to protect the information. All materials to which I have had access, or which were
furnished or otherwise made available to me in connection with my employment with the Company shall be and remain the property of the Company. For
purposes of this PECA, “Confidential or Proprietary Information” means Proprietary Information within the meaning of CRX-015C (a copy of which has
been made available to me), including but not limited to information that a person or entity desires to protect from unauthorized disclosure to third parties that
can provide the person or entity with a business, technological, or economic advantage over its competitors, or which, if known or used by third parties or if
used by the person’s or entity’s employees or agents in an unauthorized manner, might be detrimental to the person’s or entity’s interests. Confidential or

may be interpreted to disparage the Company or its directors, officers, employees, technology, products or services with respect to any matter whatsoever.
(e) Cooperation in Litigation and Investigations – Following the Termination Date, I will, to the extent reasonably requested, cooperate with the
Company in any pending or future litigation (including alternative dispute resolution proceedings) or investigations in which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates is a party or is required or requested to provide testimony and regarding which, as a result of my employment with the Company, I
reasonably could be expected to have knowledge or information relevant to the litigation or investigation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this PECA,
nothing in this PECA shall affect my obligation to cooperate with any governmental inquiry or investigation or to give truthful testimony in court.
2. Consideration and Release of Claims. I acknowledge and agree that the Severance Payment being made to me is in addition to the payments or
benefits that otherwise are or would be owed to me by the Company and that the Severance Benefit being provided to me is in consideration for my entering
into this PECA and the Release of Claims attached to this PECA. I acknowledge that the scope and duration of the restrictions in Section 1 are necessary to be
effective and are fair and reasonable in light of the value of the payments being made to me. I further acknowledge and agree that as a result of the high level
executive and
 
14
management positions I have held within the Company and the access to and extensive knowledge of the Company’s Confidential or Proprietary Information,
employees, suppliers and customers, these restrictions are reasonably required for the protection of the Company’s legitimate business interests.
 
 3. Remedies For Breach of Section 1; Additional Remedies of Clawback and Recoupment.
(a) I agree, upon demand by the Company, to repay the Severance Payment to the Company in the event any of the following occur:

 (ii)The Company determines that either (a) my intentional misconduct or gross negligence, or (b) my failure to report another person’s
intentional misconduct or gross negligence of which I had knowledge during the period I was employed by the Company,
contributed to the Company having to restate all or a portion of its financial statements filed for any period with the Securities and
Exchange Commission; or
 
 (iii)The Company determines that I engaged in fraud, bribery or any other illegal act or that my intentional misconduct or gross
negligence (including the failure to report the acts of another person of which I had knowledge during the period I was employed
by the Company) contributed to another person’s fraud, bribery or other illegal act, which in any such case adversely affected the
Company’s financial position or reputation.
(b) The remedy provided in Section 3(a) shall not be the exclusive remedy available to the Company for any of the conduct described in
Section 3(a) and shall not limit the Company from seeking damages or injunctive relief.
4. Injunctive Relief. I acknowledge that the Company’s remedies at law may be inadequate to protect the Company against any actual or
threatened breach of the provisions of Section 1 or the conduct described in Section 3(a), and, therefore, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies
otherwise available to the Company at law or in equity (including but not limited to, an action under Section 3(a), the Company shall be entitled to injunctive
relief in its favor and to specific performance without proof of actual damages and without the requirement of the posting of any bond or similar security.

permissible. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this PECA is adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, this PECA shall be deemed amended to

[PECA will vary by state law and current legal and
professional requirements at time of termination]
[Applicable provisions may be incorporated into the
release of claims agreement in lieu of a separate PECA]
This Post Employment Conduct Agreement dated                          (this “PECA”), together with the Release of Claims being entered into
contemporaneous with this PECA, is entered into in consideration of the payment (“Severance Payment”) to be made to me under the Lockheed Martin
Corporation Executive Severance Plan (“Severance Plan”). By signing below, I agree as follows:
(1) Restrictions Following Termination of Employment.
(a) Covenant Not To Compete – [NOT APPLICABLE IN CALIFORNIA] Without the express written consent of the Senior Vice President,
Human Resources of the Company, during the one-year period following the date of my termination of employment with the Company (“Termination
Date”), I will not, directly or indirectly, be employed by, provide services to, or advise a “Restricted Company” (as defined in Section 6 below),
whether as an employee, advisor, director, officer, partner or consultant, or in any other position, function or role that, in any such case,
 
 (i)oversees, controls or affects the design, operation, research, manufacture, marketing, sale or distribution of “Competitive Products
or Services” (as defined in Section 6 below) of or by the Restricted Company, or
 
 (ii)would involve a substantial risk that the “Confidential or Proprietary Information” (as defined in Section 1(c) below) of the
Company (including but not limited to technical information or intellectual property, strategic plans, information relating to pricing
offered to the Company by vendors or suppliers or to prices charged or pricing contemplated to be charged by the Company,
information relating to employee performance, promotions or identification for promotion, or information relating to the
Company’s cost base) could be used to the disadvantage of the Company.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, including but not limited to any applicable rules governing attorney conduct (such as the ABA Model
Rules of Professional Conduct and state versions thereof), Sections 1(a)(i) and (ii) and Section 1(b) relating to non-solicitation, shall apply to
individuals who are employed by the Corporation in an attorney position and whose occupation during the one-year period following employment with
the Corporation does not include practicing law.
In lieu of Section 1(a)(i) and (ii), as well as Section 1(b) relating to non-solicitation, the following Section 1(a)(iii) shall apply to individuals who
are employed by the Corporation in an attorney position, and whose occupation during the one-year period following employment with the Corporation
includes practicing law.
 
19
 (iii)Post-employment Activity As a Lawyer – I acknowledge that as counsel to the Corporation, I owe ethical and fiduciary obligations
to the Corporation and that at least some of these obligations will continue even after my Termination Date with the Corporation. I
agree that after my Termination Date I will comply fully with all applicable ethical and fiduciary obligations that I owe to the
Corporation. To the extent permitted by applicable law, including but not limited to any applicable rules governing attorney
conduct, I agree that I will not:
 
 a. Represent any client in the same or a substantially related matter in which I represented the Corporation where the client’s
interests are materially adverse to the Corporation; or
 
 b. Disclose confidential information relating to my representation of the Corporation, including the disclosure of information
that is to the disadvantage of the Corporation, except for information that is or becomes generally known.
The Corporation’s Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary or the General Tax Counsel, as applicable, will determine in
his or her discretion whether an individual is employed by the Corporation in an attorney position.
(b) Non-Solicit – Without the express written consent of the Senior Vice President, Human Resources of the Company, during the one-year
period following the Termination Date, I will not (i) interfere with any contractual relationship between the Company and any customer, supplier,
distributor or manufacturer of or to the Company to the detriment of the Company or (ii) induce or attempt to induce any person who is an employee of
the Company to perform work or services for any entity other than the Company.
(c) Protection of Proprietary Information – Except to the extent required by law, following my Termination Date, I will have a continuing
obligation to comply with the terms of any non-disclosure or similar agreements that I signed while employed by the Company committing to hold
confidential the “Confidential or Proprietary Information” (as defined below) of the Company or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, related companies,
joint ventures, partnerships, customers, suppliers, partners, contractors or agents, in each case in accordance with the terms of such agreements. I will
not use or disclose or allow the use or disclosure by others to any person or entity of Confidential or Proprietary Information of the Company or others
to which I had access or that I was responsible for creating or overseeing during my employment with the Company. In the event I become legally
compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or otherwise) to disclose any proprietary or
confidential information, I will immediately notify the Company’s Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary as to the existence
of the obligation and will cooperate with any reasonable request
 
20
by the Company for assistance in seeking to protect the information. All materials to which I have had access, or which were furnished or otherwise
made available to me in connection with my employment with the Company shall be and remain the property of the Company. For purposes of this
PECA, “Confidential or Proprietary Information” means Proprietary Information within the meaning of CRX-015C (a copy of which has been made
available to me), including but not limited to information that a person or entity desires to protect from unauthorized disclosure to third parties that can
provide the person or entity with a business, technological, or economic advantage over its competitors, or which, if known or used by third parties or if
used by the person’s or entity’s employees or agents in an unauthorized manner, might be detrimental to the person’s or entity’s interests. Confidential
or Proprietary Information may include, but is not limited to:
 
 (i)existing and contemplated business, marketing and financial business information such as business plans and methods, marketing
information, cost estimates, forecasts, financial data, cost or pricing data, bid and proposal information, customer identification,
sources of supply, contemplated product lines, proposed business alliances, and information about customers or competitors, or
 
 (ii)existing or contemplated technical information and documentation pertaining to technology, know how, equipment, machines,
devices and systems, computer hardware and software, compositions, formulas, products, processes, methods, designs,
specifications, mask works, testing or evaluation procedures, manufacturing processes, or production processes.
(d) No disparagement – Following the Termination Date, I will not make any statements, whether verbal or written, that disparage or reasonably
may be interpreted to disparage the Company or its directors, officers, employees, technology, products or services with respect to any matter
whatsoever.
(e) Cooperation in Litigation and Investigations – Following the Termination Date, I will, to the extent reasonably requested, cooperate with the
Company in any pending or future litigation (including alternative dispute resolution proceedings) or investigations in which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates is a party or is required or requested to provide testimony and regarding which, as a result of my employment with the
Company, I reasonably could be expected to have knowledge or information relevant to the litigation or investigation. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this PECA, nothing in this PECA shall affect my obligation to cooperate with any governmental inquiry or investigation or to give truthful
testimony in court.
2. Consideration and Release of Claims. I acknowledge and agree that the Severance Payment being made to me is in addition to the payments or
benefits that otherwise are or would be owed to me by the Company and that the Severance Benefit being provided to me is in consideration for my
entering into this PECA and the Release of Claims attached to this PECA. I acknowledge that
 
21
the scope and duration of the restrictions in Section 1 are necessary to be effective and are fair and reasonable in light of the value of the payments
being made to me. I further acknowledge and agree that as a result of the high level executive and management positions I have held within the

4. Injunctive Relief. I acknowledge that the Company’s remedies at law may be inadequate to protect the Company against any actual or

Performance Award Plan and RSU and PSU Award Agreements Effective January 1, 2017
Excerpt from Section 6 of the Lockheed Martin Corporation Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Performance Award Plan
(c) Mandatory Provisions Applicable to All Award Agreements. Award Agreements shall be subject to the terms of this Plan and shall be deemed to
include the following terms, unless the Committee in the Award Agreement consistent with applicable legal considerations, provides otherwise:
(1) Non-assignability: The Award shall not be assignable nor transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and during
the lifetime of a Participant, the Award shall be exercised only by the Participant or by his or her guardian or legal representative. The designation of a
Beneficiary hereunder shall not constitute a transfer prohibited by the foregoing provisions.
(2) Rights as Stockholder: A Participant shall have no rights as a holder of Stock with respect to any unissued securities covered by an Award
until the date the Participant becomes the holder of record of the securities. Except in the case of Restricted Stock and except as provided in Section 7,
no adjustment or other provision shall be made for dividends or other stockholder rights, except to the extent that the Award Agreement provides for
Dividend Equivalents or similar economic benefits.
(3) Tax Withholding: Each Participant shall be responsible for payment of all Taxes imposed on such Participant with respect to an Award. All
withholding Tax obligations shall be satisfied on or prior to the payment of an Award. If the Corporation concludes that any withholding Tax is required
with respect to any Award (including with respect to associated Dividends, Dividend Equivalents, or DDEs), and the Participant has not otherwise
made arrangements acceptable to the Corporation to satisfy the withholding Tax obligation, the Corporation may (i) offset an amount for Tax
withholding against any obligation of the Corporation to the Participant, (ii) reduce the amount of the Award (including associated Dividends, Dividend
Equivalents, or DDEs) paid to the Participant to pay Tax withholding, or (iii) require the Participant or his or her Beneficiary to pay the Corporation an
amount in cash to pay Tax withholding . The satisfaction of any withholding Taxes with respect to Share-Based Awards also may be satisfied by
cashless exercise as provided in Section 5(g).
Amendment to the RSU Award Agreements:
Notwithstanding anything in this Award Agreement to the contrary, effective January 1, 2017, income tax withholding due at the end of the Restricted
Period or on the Vesting Date (as applicable) will be made at the highest individual tax rate unless you elect otherwise in accordance with procedures
established by the Corporation.
Amendment to the PSU Award Agreements:
Notwithstanding anything in this Award Agreement to the contrary, effective January 1, 2017, income tax withholding due at the end of the Vesting
Period will be made at the highest individual tax rate unless you elect otherwise in accordance with procedures established by the Corporation.
