We launched our Radeon™ RX 7900 series GPUs powered by the AMD RDNA™ 
3 architecture, creatin g the world’s ﬁrst chiplet gamin g CPU. We solidiﬁed our
position as the industry’s number one game console processor provider with strong
demand continuin g for this generation of consoles. Our PC partners launched an 
expanded number of AMD Advantage systems combining high-performance Ryzen
CPUs, Radeon GPUs, AMD so ftware, and premium design features to deliver best-
in-class gamin g experiences. 
In 2022, given our si gniﬁcant transformation as a company, we launched our new “to gether we advance” brand campai gn. 
“Together we advance” highlights our ambition to continuously push the envelope on what is possible through our unique
approach o f deep collaboration across our customers, partners, and ecosystem. It de ﬁnes the AMD culture, brings our product
roadma p to life, and re presents the s pirit of who we as a com pany. 

We also expanded our commitment to creating a sustainable future and building a culture of innovation and inclusion by
ensuring our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals remained a key element of our business strategy. Our products 
made a meaningful impact in 2022 as we received a  2022 SEAL Sustainable Product Award  for innovative and impactful 
products “purpose-built” for a sustainable future in data center s and we made progress towards achieving our ambitious goal of 
deliverin g a 30x increase in energy efficiency  by 2025 for Artiﬁcial Intelli gence (AI) trainin g and Hi gh-Performance Computin g 
(HPC) applications running on accelerated compute nodes powered by EPYC CPUs and Instinct accelerators .
We remain committed to leading the industry in diversity, belonging, and inclusion across our global workforce, highlighted by
AMD being recognized  as a member of the 2022 Bloomber g Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the fourth consecutive year and 
receiving a 100% score from the Human Rights Campaign’s (HRC) Corporate Equality Index for the sixth straight year.
Over the last several years, we successfully executed our lon g-term product and technolo gy roadmaps, launched multiple
generations of leadership products, and si gniﬁcantly grew our datacenter, embedded, and gamin g businesses. 
Looking ahead, there has never been a more exciting time to be at AMD. The demand for high-per formance and adaptive
computin g is only increasin g and AMD is extremely well positioned to address the growin g needs with our unmatched 
IP , leadership product port folio, multi-year roadmaps, deep customer relationships, and world-class execution. We will 
continue investing to build the industry’s strongest port folio o f computing solutions across CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, DPUs, 
and adaptive SOCs — enabling us to meet our ambitious growth goals and make AMD the partner o f choice to the leading
datacenter, embedded, client and gamin g brands in the world.
Over the next several years, one o f our largest growth drivers will be AI, which is the most important megatrend shaping 
the future o f technology and is in the early stages o f trans forming virtually every industry, service and product. At its 
simplest, AI leverages the power o f high-per formance computing to analyze massive amounts o f data, uncover patterns 
and make predictions on future outcomes. AI is also on a path to unlock a whole new set o f experiences and fundamentally 
change how we interact with technology — from personalized healthcare treatments to predictive analytics that will help 
businesses make better decisions faster, to smart cities that can adjust everything from tra ffic patterns to energy usage 
in real-time… just to name a few. Most recently, the introduction of generative AI with the ability to create text, audio, 
and ima ges from simple prompts offers the opportunity to transform every industry and discipline while makin g each of 
us personally and professionally dramatically more productive. All of these advances are going to require very signiﬁcant 
increases in com pute performance. At the same time, the full potential of AI will only be unlocked when it is available 
across a wide range o f devices, from intelligent endpoints to the edge and cloud. To enable the right level o f AI capability 
across devices, multiple compute en gines are required, includin g CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive accelerators. AMD is uniquely 
positioned in the industry as the only company with the broad set of engines necessary to power the future of pervasive
AI. We look forward to working together with our partners and customers to make this vision a reality in the coming years.
I am truly excited by the opportunities in front of us. There is no better time to be in hi gh-performance computin g and no 
better time to be at AMD. Thank you as always for your continued support and for joining us on this journey.

We offer our employees opportunities to advance their careers at the Company and the majority of our new
leaders are promoted from within. We are focused on leadership progression and encourage our employees totake advantage of new opportunities. Our manager and leadership development programs are highly rated, andwe provide specialized development programs for our employees.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and
foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturingprocesses, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid andhazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtainpermits for operations making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater.Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Forexample, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that haveenacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affectsemiconductor devices and packaging. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California andChina are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and serversbased on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits.
Certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive, Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances,joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal orremediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws oftenimpose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of suchhazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardoussubstances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Suchpersons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. Wehave been named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California thatare on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to thegroundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these threesites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in theUnited States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.
In 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality
Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsibleparties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of theforeseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remainresponsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the eventthat the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.
To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated
environmental liability of approximately $3.9 million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries indetermining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predictedwith certainty and these costs may change. We believe that any amount in addition to what has already beenaccrued would not be material.

For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.
Economic and Strategic Risks
Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit
our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field.
Intel Corporation (Intel) has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market
share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target ourcustomers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us.These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price formany of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability.
Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various
brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has beenable to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type ofproducts the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, whichincludes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage andother components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standardsand specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access tosuch standards.
As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business
practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share andmargins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies;
17
exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control over
industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, includingmotherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as wellas the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioningthe Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers.
Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater
amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily inmarketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To theextent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advancedprocess technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be morevulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.
Intel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive
disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as NVIDIACorporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information or restrictingaccess to external companies. Also, Intel has developed and released their own high-end discrete GPUs,including gaming focused discrete GPUs. We also compete with Intel in field programmable gate arrays(FPGAs) and Adaptive SoC products. Intel’s position in the microprocessor, and integrated graphics chipsetmarkets, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs, and itsaggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices forour products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.
We experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic
conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain in the second half of 2022. Uncertainglobal economic conditions have and may in the future adversely impact our business. Uncertainty in theworldwide economic environment or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as inflation,interest rates or recession, may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers topostpone purchases. In addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customersmay experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products.Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to securefinancing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. The riskrelated to our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect thata small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. Any inability of ourcurrent or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting ourability to manufacture our products. In addition, uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for usto raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities.
The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially
adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future.
The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction
with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new productintroductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred substantial losses inprevious downturns, due to substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply anddemand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end-user products (such as PCs) thatincorporate our products; and excess inventory levels.
Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may
materially adversely affect us in the future. Global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted
18
the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted
demand for our products. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected bythese downturns. In the second half of 2022, we experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a resultof weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain.
The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent
emerging global markets. Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establishadequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets.If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have amaterial adverse effect on us.
The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are
sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations.
Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may
materially adversely affect us in the future. Our Client segment revenue is focused on the consumer desktop andnotebook PC segments, which in the second half of 2022 experienced a decline as a result of weak PC marketmacroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. In the past, revenuesfrom the Client and Gaming segments have experienced a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption ofsmaller and other form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. The success of oursemi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline andconsumer market conditions, including the success of the Sony PlayStation
®5, Microsoft®XboxTMSeries S and
Microsoft®XboxTMSeries X game console systems and next generation consoles for Sony and Microsoft,
worldwide. In addition, the GPU market has at times seen elevated demand due to the application of GPUproducts to cryptocurrency mining. For example, our GPU revenue has been affected in part by the volatility ofthe cryptocurrency mining market. Demand for cryptocurrency has changed and is likely to continue to changequickly. For example, China has banned such activities, and corresponding interest in mining of such currenciesare subject to significant fluctuations. Alternatively, countries have created and may continue to create their owncryptocurrencies or equivalents that could also impact interest in mining. If we are unable to manage the risksrelated to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market, our GPU business could be materially adverselyaffected.
The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.
We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business and we expect that a small
number of customers will continue to account for a significant part of our revenue in the future. If one of our keycustomers decides to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers materially reduces its operations orits demand for our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.
The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused government authorities to implement numerous public health measures,
including at various times vaccination and testing requirements and recordkeeping, quarantines, businessclosures, travel bans, and restrictions related to social gathering and mobility, to contain the virus. Various stateand federal rules are issued and updated on an ongoing basis, at times in conflict and/or with minimal notice. Wehave experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions to our business as these changing measureshave, and will continue to have, an effect on our business operations and practices.
While our employees gradually return to office, we continue to monitor our operations and public health
measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to COVID-19. Although some public health
19
measures have eased, our efforts to reopen our offices safely may not be successful and could expose our
employees to health risks. It is uncertain as to when all health measures put in place to attempt to contain thespread of COVID-19 will be lifted. If there are further waves of the virus, health measures may bereimplemented and we may need to further limit operations or modify our business practices in a manner thatmay impact our business. If our employees are not able to perform their job duties due to self-isolation,quarantine, lockdown measures, unavailability of COVID 19 tests, travel restrictions or illness, a reluctance orrefusal to vaccinate, or are unable to perform them as efficiently at home for an extended period of time, we maynot be able to meet our product schedules, roadmaps and customer commitments and we may experience anoverall lower productivity of our workforce. Even when COVID-19 health measures are lifted or modified, ouremployees’ ability or willingness to return to work may delay the return of our full workforce and the resumptionof normal business operations.
COVID-19 continues to impact the global supply chain causing disruptions to service providers, logistics and the
flow and availability of supplies and products. We have experienced some disruptions to parts of our supplychain as a result of COVID-19 and we adjust our supply chain requirements based on changing customer needsand demands. We have taken efforts to maintain a stable supply of materials to meet our production requirementsthrough long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers. If we areunable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates at a reasonable cost, it could have amaterial adverse effect on our business. We may also assess our product schedules and roadmaps to make anyadjustments that may be necessary to support remote working requirements and address the geographic andmarket demand shifts caused by COVID-19. If the supply of our products to customers is delayed, reduced orcanceled due to disruptions encountered by our third-party manufacturers, back-end manufacturers, warehouses,partners, suppliers or vendors as a result of facility closures, border and port restrictions or closures,transportation delays, lockdown measures, labor shortages or workforce mobility limitations, it could have amaterial adverse effect on our business.
COVID-19 has in the short-term and may in the long-term adversely impact the global economy, creating
uncertainty and potentially leading to an economic downturn. This could negatively impact consumer confidenceand spending causing our customers to postpone or cancel purchases, or delay paying or default on payment ofoutstanding amounts due to us, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Even in times ofstrong demand for our products, the worldwide economic environment remains uncertain due to COVID-19 andsuch demand may not be sustainable over the longer term.
COVID-19 has also led to a disruption and volatility in the global capital and financial markets. While we
believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments along with our Revolving Credit Agreement andcash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, and purchasecommitments, over the next 12 months and beyond, to the extent we may require additional funding to financeour operations and capital expenditures and such funding may not be available to us as a result of contractingcapital and financial markets resulting from COVID-19, it may have an adverse effect on our business.
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and financial results will depend on future developments,
which are unpredictable and highly uncertain, including the continued spread, duration and severity of theoutbreak, the appearances of new variants of COVID-19, the breadth and duration of business disruptions relatedto COVID-19, the availability and distribution of effective treatments and vaccines, and public health measuresand actions taken throughout the world to contain COVID-19. The prolonged effect of COVID-19 couldmaterially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.
The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to
market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determineour product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities
20
(including enabling state-of-the-art visual and virtual reality (VR) experiences), energy efficiency (including
power consumption and battery life), reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor),selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level ofintegration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of software design tools,completeness of applicable software solutions, security and stability, brand recognition and availability.
We expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product
introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experienceor that may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive. We may alsoface aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. In addition, ourcompetitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment ina declining market, leading to lower prices and margins. Some competitors may have greater access or rights tocomplementary technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. For instance,with our APU products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand foradditional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality andperformance of integrated graphics. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us,demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. In addition,Intel is expanding its position in integrated graphics for the PC market with high-end discrete graphics solutionsfor a broad range of computing segments, which may negatively impact our ability to compete in thesecomputing segments. We also face competition from companies that use competing computing architectures andplatforms like the ARM architecture. Increased adoption of ARM-based semiconductor designs could lead tofurther growth and development of the ARM ecosystem.
In addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to
customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to competesuccessfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets orsuperior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. Furthermore, we may facecompetition from some of our customers who internally develop the same products as us. We may face delays ordisruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resourcesin research and development than anticipated. Also, the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers andacquisitions over the last number of years. Further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to therebeing fewer suppliers, customers and partners in the industry.
Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.
The profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. A large portion of our quarterly sales have
historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue foreach financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financialcondition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products aresold. For example, historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than inthe first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Many ofthe factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control.
If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad,
through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitiveadvantage and incur significant expenses.
We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure
agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect ourintellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology orother intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States andabroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated, expire, or circumvented orrights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us.
21
Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the
patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectualproperty rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around ourpatents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectualproperty on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide lessintellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad, our technology or other intellectualproperty may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected.
Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.
We have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a consequence, movements in
exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue,affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our foreigncurrency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreigncurrency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure youthat these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have anadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majorityof our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollarand the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of suchcustomers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products.
Operational and Technology Risks
We rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in
sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.
We utilize third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We rely on Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of all wafers for microprocessorand GPU products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes, and we rely primarily on GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc.(GF) for wafers for microprocessor and GPU products manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm. We alsoutilize TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for our integratedcircuits (IC) in the form of programmable logic devices. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble,test, mark and pack (ATMP) our products. Our third-party package assembly partners are responsible forpackaging technology used to fabricate our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all ofthese third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand.
We cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to
meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the reduced quantities of affected productsamongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers andon our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or latesupply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness. For example, if TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our microprocessor and GPU products at7 nm or smaller nodes and our newest IC products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it couldhave a material adverse effect on our business.
We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We
obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not requiredto provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchaseorder. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacitysufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yieldsand to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also
22
fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could
choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, requireonerous prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.
Other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery
schedules, yield, cycle times, quality assurance, price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand,misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several subcontractors, and limited ability tomanage inventory and parts. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers (or their subcontractors) sufferany damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficientcapacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary rawmaterials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertainsocial, economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If weare unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may beadversely affected and this could materially affect our business.
If we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed
product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems withproduct quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we forother reasons cease utilizing one of those manufacturers, we may be unable to timely secure an alternative supplyfor any specific product. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we arerequired to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.
We are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase
products manufactured by GF and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into anamendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the Amendment). Under theAmendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMDhas corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any ofthese years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases andthe wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMDwas obligated in 2022 and is obligated in 2023 to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers. The Amendmentno longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any waferfoundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements areless than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could haveexcess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and ourresults of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experiencesignificant delays in the shipment of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu
Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is noguarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meetcustomer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have amaterial adverse effect on our business.
If essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our
products, we could be materially adversely affected.
We may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers
from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies ofequipment and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery ofadequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our
23
products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order
to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in themanufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a solesupplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integratedcircuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU products. Similarly, certain non-proprietarymaterials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitorsused in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of suppliers. If we areunable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonablecosts to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substratesupply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We havelong-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers. If the delivery ofsuch supply is delayed or does not occur for any reason, it could materially impact our ability to procure andprocess the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demandcould result in excess inventory and an increase in our production costs, particularly since we have prepaymentarrangements with certain suppliers. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-partymanufacturers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one equipment or materials supplierfor another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacityconstraints or other factors. Also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes inprice and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and priceincreases in various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliersexacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturingoperations, or our third-party manufacturers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, ourbusiness would be materially adversely affected.
Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial
results.
Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of product design, process technology and packaging
technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures,packaging technology failures, process technology failures or a combination of some or all of these. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party manufacturers experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficultiesduring production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or we may experience product delivery delays. Wecannot be certain that our third-party manufacturers will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implementleading-edge process or packaging technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our productsprofitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processesearlier. Moreover, during periods when our third-party manufacturers are implementing new process orpackaging technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in thetechnology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly ifour competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusingour 7 nm and lower product microprocessor and GPU portfolio on TSMC’s processes. If TSMC is not able tomanufacture wafers for our products at 7 nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand,it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, we rely on TSMC, UMC and our otherfoundries to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes for our IC products. Therefore, thefoundries, particularly TSMC which manufactures our newest IC products, must be able to transition to advancedmanufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliverthem in a timely manner.
Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact
our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which couldharm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.
24
The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features
and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significantindustry transitions.
Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of
new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify anddistribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industryrequirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis, are significant factors in determiningour competitiveness in our target markets. As consumers have new product feature preferences or have differentrequirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which couldadversely impact our business. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will resultin innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed indeveloping, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and addressthese new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our businessaccordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us todiscount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research anddevelopment, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement newproducts and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, ourinvestments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt ourongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities andmay divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain thatour ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and willnot adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.
Delays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers’ product
design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customersdo not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not useour products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of beingqualified for inclusion in a customer’s system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss acycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. Wealso depend on the success and timing of our customers’ platform launches. If our customers delay their productlaunches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delayin bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which couldmaterially adversely affect our business. In addition, market demand requires that products incorporate newfeatures and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the sale price istypically reduced over time. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products isnecessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products withsufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the saleprices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected.
Our revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being
incorporated into customers’ products and the success of those products.
The revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees
charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of oursemi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers’desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers’products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party’sproducts and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts ofthese third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current orfuture years. Consequently, the semi-custom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized andour operating results may be adversely affected.
25
Our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us.
The products that we sell are complex and have been and may in the future be subject to security vulnerabilities
that could result in, among other things, the loss, corruption, theft or misuse of confidential data or systemperformance issues. Our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance, beonly partially effective or not successful at all. We may depend on vendors to create mitigations to theirtechnology that we incorporate into our products and they may delay or decline to make such mitigations. Wemay also depend on third parties, such as customers and end users, to deploy our mitigations alone or as part oftheir own mitigations, and they may delay, decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. Ourrelationships with our customers could be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing ourproducts, reduce or delay future purchases of our products, or use competing products. Any of these actions byour customers could adversely affect our revenue. We have and may in the future be subject to claims andlitigation related to security vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products maysubject us to adverse publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business orfinancial results.
IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other
sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation andoperations.
In the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (IT) assets, and
also may maintain sensitive information on our business partners’ and third-party providers’ IT assets, includingour intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that ofour customers and business partners. The White House, SEC and other regulators have also increased their focuson companies’ cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Maintaining the security of this information is important toour business and reputation. AMD and companies like AMD and our vendors and customers have beenincreasingly subject to cybersecurity attempts and threats. The increased prevalence of work-from-homearrangements at AMD and our providers has presented additional operational risks and cybersecurity attackvectors to our IT systems. These threats can come from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from anindividual hacker or insider threat to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may becustom-crafted against our information systems. Cyber threats have and may come into our network throughmalicious code that is added to widely available open-source software, compromised commercial software orsecurity vulnerabilities in our products or those of a third party that are being used by attackers prior tomitigations being put in place, such as zero-day attacks. Cyber-attacks have and may come into our IT systemthrough the compromise of our users’ access credentials. Users’ access credentials can be compromised byphishing, vishing, smishing, multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompt bombing, hacking, or other socialengineering, cybersecurity, or theft activities. Cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and muchharder to detect, defend against or prevent and have and may cause a disruption to our business. Our network andstorage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, may besubject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other systemdisruptions.
It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. It
also may not be possible to determine the root cause of such incidents or mitigate quickly enough to stop anattack. These data breaches and any unauthorized access, misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectualproperty could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information or personallyidentifiable information. Cyber-attacks on us or our customers, business partners or third-party providers couldalso cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key businessoperations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents couldalso subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation andbusiness.
26
We also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers and consumers. The
confidentiality and integrity of our worker and consumer data is important to our business and our workers andconsumers have a high expectation that we adequately protect their personal information. In addition, manygovernments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union’sGeneral Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and failure to comply or a breachof personally identifiable information could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments or litigationby other entities.
We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls,
including costs related to upgrading application, computer, and network security components; training workers tomaintain and monitor our security controls; investigating, responding to and remediating any data securitybreach, and addressing any related litigation; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with externalregulations.
We often partner with third-party providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited
worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. We also providesensitive information to vendors, customers and contractors. If these third parties fail to adopt or adhere toadequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers’ data and sensitiveinformation may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.
A breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately
maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability tomaintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidentialinformation, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, ourcompetitive position and operating results.
We may encounter difficulties in upgrading and operating our new enterprise resource planning system,
which could materially adversely affect us.
We are currently upgrading our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to help us manage our operations and
financial reporting. The adoption of a new ERP system is a major undertaking and poses several challenges, bothfinancially and from a management and personnel perspective. Costs and risks inherent in the conversion to ourupgraded and new system may include disruptions to business continuity, difficulty in maintaining effectiveinternal controls, administrative and technical problems, interruptions or delays in sales processes, expenditureoverruns, and data migration issues. If we do not properly address or mitigate these issues it could result inincreased costs and the diversion of management’s attention and resources, negatively impacting our operatingresults and ability to effectively manage our business. Moreover, once our ERP system is upgraded, it may notoperate as we expect it to and cause disruption to our operations. There are no assurances that our new ERPsystem will be successfully implemented and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.
Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.
We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term
supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must befor standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers’estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products thatour customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is evenfurther complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors andcustomers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout thedownstream channel. For instance, we have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our
27
products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase
production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, itcould limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of ourmarkets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. Inaddition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. For example, in thesecond half of 2022, we experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC marketmacroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. We may buildinventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders oroverproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory,which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may alsoexperience a shortage of, or delay in receiving certain components to build their products, which in turn mayaffect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, OEMs have and continue to experienceindustry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.
Excess or obsolete inventory have and may in the future result in write-downs of the value of our inventory. For
example, in the third quarter of 2022, we recorded certain charges primarily for inventory, pricing and relatedreserves in the Gaming and Client segments. Other factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventoryinclude, a reduction in the average selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden orsignificant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidenceof inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure toaccurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products areintroduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.
Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner includes use of third-party intellectual
property.
In the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as
development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely onintellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demandfor more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual propertythat we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame,manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meetcustomer demands, or laws are adopted that affect our use of third party intellectual property in certain regions orproducts, our business could be materially adversely affected.
We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software,
memory and other computer platform components to support our business and products.
We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards,
software (e.g., BIOS, operating systems, drivers), memory and other components that we use to design, supportand sell, and our customers utilize to support and/or use our product offerings. We also rely on our AIB partnersto support our products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards andchipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers ofmotherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufactureor production of current or future products that are based on, utilized in, or support our products, or laws areadopted that result in the same, our business could be materially adversely affected.
If we lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and
develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.
Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft
designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products.
28
With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system
to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APUproducts, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on ourproducts. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with ourx86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphicsproducts, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage ofour innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software driverslicensed for use with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if weotherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our productswould be materially adversely affected.
Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.
We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to
agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party.These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors’products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and salesefforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partnersterminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors’ products over our products or decidednot to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would bematerially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significantdistributors and/or AIB partners, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable tomanage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentivesto focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.
Additionally, distributors and AIB partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances,
our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well asprovide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months olderthan the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotationprovisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventoryof our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, theprice protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and correspondinggross margin would decline.
Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information
systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internalcontrols.
We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions,
and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes andinformation systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may requiremodifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems willcontinually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive toour operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.
These changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures
and significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously work on simplifying ourinformation systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be noassurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition.Our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or businesspartners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control includingcatastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, insider
29
threat attacks, unauthorized system or data modifications, data breaches and computer system or network
failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business.
In addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and
sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloudthat can promote business efficiency. However, these practices can also result in a more distributed ITenvironment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users,and meet scalability and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed ofthese changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would bematerially adversely affected.
If our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be
materially adversely affected.
Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we
may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers areunable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Inaddition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a materialadverse effect on our business.
Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.
Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new
versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testingprocedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipmentsin the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall andreplacement costs, loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of theattention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related todefective products or related liabilities, including property damage, personal injury, damage to our reputation inthe industry and loss of data or intangible property, and could adversely affect our relationships with ourcustomers. In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in thefield. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of theseproblems could materially adversely affect our business.
We could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have
caused, an injury, whether tangible or intangible. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling ourproducts, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. Aproduct liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess ofinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.
If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our
products, our business could be materially adversely affected.
Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our
customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distributionand fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets,acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chainwill become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements forparticular products, geographic requirements, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of theseproducts. If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the rightlocations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverseeffect on our business.
30
We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product
distribution, transportation management and information technology support services.
We rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the
transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our third-party manufacturersand to our customers. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services tous, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, serverand storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access.We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner inaccordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products toour customers could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with thesethird-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house orsecure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executedappropriately.
Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse
effect on us.
We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to
time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray market.” Graymarket products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demandaccurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete withthese heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negativelyimpacts our margins. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customersatisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is arisk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have beenaltered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
Government actions and regulations such as export regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures may
limit our ability to export our products to certain customers.
We have equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information
Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity. In June 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security(BIS) of the United States Department of Commerce added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, includingTHATIC and the THATIC JV. Since that time, the United States administration has called for changes todomestic and foreign policy, including policies with respect to China and Russia. Specifically, United States-China trade relations remain uncertain as the United States continues to add more Chinese companies to theEntity List and more regulations targeted to advanced computing, semiconductor manufacturing, and AI. Further,the United States and other countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control andother regulations against Russia, Belarus or the DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine.BIS has issued new requirements that prevent us from shipping MI250 and MI250X integrated circuits to Chinaand Russia without a license. BIS may possibly issue new licensing requirements and regulatory controls in thefuture. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures orrestrictions could result in lost sales adversely impacting our reputation and business. There is also a possibilityof future tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on ourproducts or on our customers by the United States, China or other countries that could have a material adverseeffect on our business. Export control restrictions may adversely impact the ability of our research anddevelopment teams located outside of the United States from executing our product roadmaps in a timely manneror at all.
We may, from time to time, receive technical data from third parties that is subject to the International Traffic
and Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are administered by the U.S. Department of State. EAR and ITAR govern
31
the export and re-export of certain AMD products, including FPGAs, and the transfer of related technologies,
whether in the U.S. or abroad, and the provision of services. We are required to maintain an internal complianceprogram and security infrastructure to meet EAR and ITAR requirements. An inability to obtain the requiredexport licenses, or to predict when they will be granted, increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. Inaddition, security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export privileges, aswell as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas customers, couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
If we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable
income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Each quarter, we consider both positive and negativeevidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Ifwe determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense inthe period in which this determination is made which may have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition and results of operations.
In addition, a significant amount of our deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits which
remain under a valuation allowance could be subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The limitations could reduce our ability toutilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes.
Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities, and exposure to greater-than-anticipated income tax
liabilities as a result of changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules andregulations, or unfavorable assessments from tax audits, any of which could affect our effective tax rates,financial condition, and results of operations.
We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims in multiple
U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determiningour worldwide provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passedand new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Any changes to tax laws could have a material adverseeffect on our tax obligations and effective tax rate. Our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors,including, but not limited to, changes to our corporate operating structure, intercompany arrangements, and taxplanning strategies.
Our income tax expense is computed based on tax rates at the time of the respective financial period. Our future
effective tax rates, financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes inthe tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in the tax rules and regulations or theinterpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in thevaluation of our deferred tax assets.
In addition, we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We
regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of ourprovision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the currentexaminations. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not havean adverse effect on our effective tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations.
In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income
tax, indirect tax, or other tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable,we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits or litigation will not be materially different fromthat which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result ofan audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, tax provisions and netincome in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
32
We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur
substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products.
From time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions, as described in Note 17—
Contingencies of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For example, we have been subject tocertain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. Our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claimsand consumer class action claims. On occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed tosubstances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure causedharm. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. It is possible thatif a claim is successfully asserted against us, it could result in the payment of damages that could be material toour business.
With respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may
bring or have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringingthe intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual propertyrights of others, improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using theintellectual property of others. If any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the thirdparties’ intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessarylicenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seekingdamages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products thatincorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presentlyconducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs ofselling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including materialroyalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale ofsome or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, toredesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremelyexpensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/orcould have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectualproperty rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded.
Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of
our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect onus.
We are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result inadditional costs and liabilities.
Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and
foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturingprocesses, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid andhazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. For the manufacturing of our products, these laws andregulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations, including the discharge of air pollutants andwastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance, we cannotassure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulationsand permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result,including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, saleslimitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Such non-compliance from our manufacturingsuppliers could result in disruptions in supply, higher sourcing costs, and/or reputational damage for us. Wecould also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored,released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our current or former facilities or other
33
environmental or natural resource damage. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we
cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in thefuture. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental andhealth and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardoussubstances will not have a material adverse effect on us.
Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For
example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that haveenacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affectsemiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue toincrease around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that aresubject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions,or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes indemand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, Californiaand China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers andservers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is thepotential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adverselyaffect us.
Certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive, Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances,joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal orremediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws oftenimpose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of suchhazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardoussubstances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Suchpersons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. Wehave been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale, California. Although we have notbeen, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. Inaddition, contamination that has not been identified could exist at our other facilities.
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted disclosure
and reporting requirements for companies that use “conflict” minerals originating from the Democratic Republicof Congo or adjoining countries. We continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with theserequirements, such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process, determining thesource of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and theSEC. In addition to the SEC regulation, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions are developing newpolicies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program.Customers are increasingly seeking information about the source of minerals used in our supply chain beyondthose addressed in laws and regulations. Given the complexity of mineral supply chains, we may facereputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover, weare likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of ourproducts be certified as “conflict free.” If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor’sproducts.
In addition to our company, customers, governments and authorities continue to be focused on eliminating risks
of forced labor in supply chains which may increase the cost of our compliance program. For example, theUnited States Uyghur Forced Labor Prevent Act prohibits goods mined, produced or manufactured wholly or inpart in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People’s Republic of China, or by certain entities, fromentering the United States under the presumption of being made with forced labor. Germany’s federalprocurement office, in collaboration with the Bitkom trade association, has issued supply chain laborrequirements. In addition, the United Kingdom, Australia and the State of California have enacted laws that
34
require us to disclose our policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking
in our supply chain. Several customers have also issued expectations to eliminate these occurrences, if any, thatmay impact us. While we have a Human Rights Policy and management systems to identify and avoid thesepractices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance to these lawsand expectations. We may face enforcement liability and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficientlymeet these expectations. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we cannot satisfytheir forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitor’s product.
Merger, Acquisition and Integration Risks
Acquisitions, joint ventures and/or investments and the failure to integrate acquired businesses, could disrupt
our business and/or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock.
Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in
response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, wemay pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies or throughjoint ventures or investments rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisitionor joint venture candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfullycomplete identified acquisitions or joint ventures.
For example, on February 14, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Xilinx and on May 26, 2022, we completed
our acquisition of Pensando. While we believe these acquisitions will result in certain benefits, including certainoperational synergies and cost efficiencies, and drive product innovations, achieving these anticipated benefitswill depend on successfully combining our and the acquired companies’ businesses together. It is not certain thatthe acquired companies can be successfully integrated with our business in a timely manner or at all, or that anyof the anticipated benefits will be realized for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: our inability tointegrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner; diversion of capital and otherresources, including management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated costs or liabilitiesassociated with the integration; failure to leverage the increased scale of the combined businesses quickly andeffectively; coordinating and integrating in countries in which we have not previously operated; the potentialimpact of the acquisitions on our relationships with employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; the impairmentof relationships with, or the loss of, the acquired companies’ employees, vendors, suppliers and customers;adverse changes in general economic conditions in regions in which we and the acquired companies operate;potential litigation associated with the acquisitions; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture;difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; challenges in attractingand retaining key personnel; and difficulties with integrating and upgrading our and the acquired companies’financial reporting systems. Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could resultin increased costs, decreases in expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention, whichcould materially impact the combined company. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses areintegrated successfully, the full benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized within the anticipated time frameor at all. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions andnegatively impact the combined company. If we cannot successfully integrate our and the acquired companies’businesses and operations, or if there are delays in combining the businesses, it could negatively impact ourability to develop or sell new products and impair our ability to grow our business, which in turn could adverselyaffect our financial condition and operating results.
Acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have
little or no prior experience. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of acquisitions or jointventures, which could harm our operating results. In addition, to complete an acquisition, we may issue equitysecurities, which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our commonstock, and/or incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquiredassets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, if such acquisitions or joint ventures
35
require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms
favorable to us or at all. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture, we may not be able toassimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnelor operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us.
Acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could
harm our business. Also, any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives couldadversely affect our business. We may not adequately assess the risks of new business initiatives and subsequentevents may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered. Furthermore, we may not achieve theobjectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services. The majority of our ATMPservices are provided by the ATMP JVs, and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from theATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
In addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our business initiatives. For example, we may not
realize the expected benefits from the THATIC JV’s expected future performance, including the receipt of anyfuture milestone payments and any royalties from certain licensed intellectual property. In June 2019, the BISadded certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. We are complying withU.S. law pertaining to the Entity List designation.
Any impairment of our tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including
goodwill, may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.
We account for certain acquisitions, including the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, using the acquisition
method of accounting under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing theaccounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, andliabilities assumed, at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price overthe net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the Xilinx andPensando acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balancesheet.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible
and intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, inthe future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record animpairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment andassumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair value. Subsequent to our annual goodwillimpairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changesin business climate or operating results, changes in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfullyintroduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significantdeclines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. A decrease in the long-termeconomic outlook and future cash flows of our business could significantly impact asset values and potentiallyresult in the impairment of goodwill and may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges, whichmay have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Risks
The agreements governing our notes, our guarantees of the Assumed Xilinx Notes, and our Revolving Credit
Agreement impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.
The indenture governing our 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 and 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 contains various
covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: create liens on certain assets to secure debt, enter intocertain sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate with, merge into or sell, convey or lease all orsubstantially all of our assets to any other person.
36
Additionally, in connection with the acquisition of Xilinx, we entered into supplemental indentures for the
Assumed Xilinx Notes pursuant to which all obligations of Xilinx under the Assumed Xilinx Notes areunconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by us. The indentures governing the Assumed XilinxNotes also contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, create certain liens onprincipal property or the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactionswith respect to principal property, and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantiallyall our assets, taken as a whole, to another person.
We also have a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion
(Revolving Credit Agreement). Our Revolving Credit Agreement contains various covenants which limit ourability to, among other things, incur liens and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety orsubstantially as an entirety (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). In addition, our RevolvingCredit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio at the end of eachfiscal quarter. The agreements governing our notes and our Revolving Credit Agreement contain cross-defaultprovisions whereby a default under certain agreements with respect to other indebtedness would result in crossdefaults under the indentures or the Revolving Credit Agreement. For example, the occurrence of a default withrespect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay indebtedness when due in an amount in excess of (i)$50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures (to the extent such default would result in theacceleration of such indebtedness) governing our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes),and (ii) $500 million would cause a cross default under the Revolving Credit Agreement (to the extent suchdefault (other than the failure to repay indebtedness) would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness). Theoccurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders orthe lenders under our Revolving Credit Agreement to declare all amounts outstanding under the indentures or theRevolving Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under theindentures governing our 2.125% Notes or the lenders under our Revolving Credit Agreement accelerate therepayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings.
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy
or fulfilling our contractual obligations.
Our total debt principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion. Our indebtedness may
make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interestpayments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions andgeneral corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing forfuture working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use asubstantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; place us at a competitivedisadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and increase our vulnerability to the impactof adverse economic and industry conditions.
We enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain accounts receivables,
which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-relatedreasons, and are not included in our indebtedness. We could become obligated to repurchase such accountsreceivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certaincircumstances, such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor.
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements. Also, if we cannot
generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make allof our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
Our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements will depend on our financial and
operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailingeconomic, financial and business conditions along with other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We
37
cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our
working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may berequired to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtainadditional financing.
In addition, our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue
and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research anddevelopment expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flowand may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, orother competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research anddevelopment efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greaterresources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operatingresults could decline.
Our inability to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned
investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments inresearch and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our businesswould be materially adversely affected.
General Risks
Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could
have a material adverse effect on us.
We maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin
America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly allproduct assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities, operated by third-party manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. We also depend on third-party subcontractors toprovide shipment services. We also have international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of netrevenue, were 66% for the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect that international sales will continue to bea significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future.
The political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without
limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; changes intax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties inprotecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employmentpractices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and otherassets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions,including interest rates, inflation and recession; disruption in air transportation between the United States and ouroverseas facilities; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with United States lawsand regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws andregulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the United States and other countries and coalitionshave issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus or the DNR orLNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and Taiwancould disrupt the operations of our Taiwan based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities andsubcontractors, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
In addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters and
climate change such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, droughts, fires, extreme heat and volcaniceruptions that disrupt our operations, or those of our manufacturers, vendors or customers. For example, ourSanta Clara and San Jose operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we haveoperations and employees in regions that have experienced extreme weather such as prolonged heat waves,wildfires and freezing. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected
38
manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in
which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such asCOVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service fromutilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governmentsworldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19.We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures have, andwill continue to have, an effect on our business operations and practices.
In addition, many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the
European Union’s general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failureto comply could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments. The European Union’s General DataProtection Regulation imposes significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, aswell as significant fines for non-compliance.
Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production and
shipment delays, general business interruptions, the inability to obtain, or delays from difficulties in obtaining exportlicenses for certain technology, penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent licensing restrictions thatmay make our products less attractive to international customers, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longerpayment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety offoreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.
We may incur future impairments of our technology license purchases.
We license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the
value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carryingvalue of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. Factors such as the life of the assets, changesin competing technologies, and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. Theoccurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges.
Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business.
Much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales
and executive employees. Competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry isintense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience. Ifwe are not able to continue to attract, train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary forour business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materiallyadversely affected. To help attract, retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees, we use share-basedincentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value ofsuch stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if ourshare-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain andmotivate our executives and employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Also, if thevalue of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create great personal wealth for ourexecutives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel. In addition, any future restructuring plansmay adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees.
Our stock price is subject to volatility.
Our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the
future. The trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipatedfluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or financialestimates and ratings by securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debtor equity to the public, interest rate changes, inflation, news regarding our products or products of our
39
competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our
equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, volatility in ourstock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities.
In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $4 billion of our common
stock (Existing Repurchase Program). In February 2022, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchaseprogram in addition to our Existing Repurchase Program to purchase up to $8 billion of our outstanding commonstock in the open market (collectively referred to as the Repurchase Program). The Repurchase Program does notobligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at anytime. Our stock repurchases could affect the trading price of our stock, the volatility of our stock price, reduceour cash reserves, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which may result in a decrease in our stockprice.
Worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products.
Worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United
States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our salesand our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest areunpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terroristattacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products,and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers orcustomers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products moredifficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could causeconsumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwidefinancial markets.

Introduction
In this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro
Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “our” or “AMD”), including a discussion ofour results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and adiscussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisonsbetween 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.
Overview
2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business.
In February 2022, we completed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technologyand product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapidinnovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we havetraditionally not had a significant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), AdaptiveSoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products. With the acquisition of Xilinx, we haveaccess to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May2022, we expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc.(Pensando). We now offer high-performance data processing units (DPUs) and a software stack thatcomplements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to providethe industry’s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance,security, flexibility and total cost of ownership for leading-edge data centers.
Our 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC
market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net revenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44%compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64% increase in DataCenter segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC
™server processors, a 21% increase in
Gaming segment revenue primarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase inEmbedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product sales.This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processorshipments driven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain.Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022, was 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease ingross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.Operating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decreasein operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinxacquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The decrease in netincome was primarily driven by lower operating income.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to
$3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was$2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.
43
We took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in
aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924%Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.393% Senior Notesdue 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924%per annum, and the 4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum.The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured obligations.
We also entered into a revolving credit agreement in June 2022. The agreement provides for a five-year
unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawnfrom this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. In November 2022, we established a newcommercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximumprincipal amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue.The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest atrates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, we had nocommercial paper outstanding.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders through
the repurchase of 36.3 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31,2022, $6.5 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The repurchase programdoes not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended ordiscontinued at any time.
We continued executing our product technology roadmap by delivering a number of new leadership products and
technologies during 2022. For Data Center, we launched our 4th Gen AMD EPYC
™processors with next-

For the Client segment, we introduced the Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop processors powered by the new “Zen 4”
architecture for gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. Along with the introduction of the Ryzen 7000 SeriesDesktop processors, we also unveiled the new Socket AM5 platform featuring four new chipsets. These newdesktop processors are designed for gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. We introduced AMD Ryzen 7000Mobile processors with up to 16 “Zen 4” architecture cores. We also introduced the AMD Ryzen 6000 SeriesMobile processors, built on “Zen 3+” architecture and includes AMD RDNA
™2 architecture based on integrated
graphics. We launched the AMD Ryzen 5000 C-Series processors bringing “Zen 3” architecture to premiumChrome OS devices for work and collaboration. The processors offer up to eight high performance x86 cores. Forworkstations, we introduced the new AMD Ryzen Threadripper
™PRO 5000 WX-Series workstation processors
designed for professionals to run demanding workstation applications. We also introduced the AMD Ryzen PRO7030 Series Mobile processors built on “Zen 3” core architecture.
44
In the Gaming segment, we unveiled the AMD Radeon™RX 7900 XTX and the Radeon RX 7900 XT gaming
graphics cards that are built on next-generation high performance, energy-efficient AMD RDNA™3 architecture.
We announced new graphics cards to the AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series product line: the AMD Radeon RX 6950XT, the AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT and the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT. These new graphics cards are built onAMD RDNA 2 gaming architecture and GDDR6 memory at up to 18Gbps. We launched the new AMD RadeonPRO GPUs including the introduction of the AMD Radeon PRO W6400 graphics card built on AMD RDNA 2architecture.
Although the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices, we
experienced limited disruptions during 2022. We continue to monitor our operations and public health measuresimplemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.
We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information
that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financialstatements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accountingprinciples, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles(U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments thataffect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-goingbasis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, business combination, goodwill, long-lived andintangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various otherassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis formaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historicallybeen reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates orour estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of
our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
Revenue Allowances. Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under
ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled andwhich we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled byestimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments tothe contract price for rights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers andrights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers.
We base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity
and experience, including actual historical returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customersadjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current economic conditions, or both.
Our estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products
held by distributors are based on actual historical incentives provided to distributor customers and known futureprice movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.
Our estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing
agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and estimates of future OEM rebate program attainmentbased on internal and external market data analysis.
45
We offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing promotions. Where funds provided
for such programs can be estimated, we recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue isrecognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenuetransaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion ofthe customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, suchamounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.
We also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return
rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, fromtime to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on theapplicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns,including product restocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trendedactual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or events, asapplicable.
Overall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with
OEM and distributor customers, based on our assumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events,have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management’sjudgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in futureadjustments to our revenue and operating results.
Inventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or
estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Materialassumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each productand are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products,we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreasesin demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower ofcost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and sellingprices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such asfuture demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative impact to our gross marginin that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below theultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or nooffsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall, ourestimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.
Business Combinations. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired,
liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fairvalue of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded asgoodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially withrespect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing developed technology, in-process research anddevelopment, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets include, but are not limited to,expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customerrelationships, useful lives, and discount rates.
Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are
inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation ofpurchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, includinggoodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from theacquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with thecorresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustmentsare recorded to earnings.
46
Goodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. Our reporting units are at theoperating segment level. Our goodwill is contained within three reporting units: Data Center, Gaming andEmbedded.
We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain
events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. Theanalysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment, whichoccurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Significant judgment is required inestimating the fair value of our reporting units to determine if the fair values of those units exceed their carryingvalues and an impairment to goodwill is required when a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. Wetypically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to help in determining the fair value of ourreporting units. The fair values of our reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach,which requires estimating the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting unit, and the marketapproach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reportingunit. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomicconditions, growth rates of our reporting units in the near- and long-term, expectations of our ability to executeon our roadmap and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows. Significant estimates used in themarket approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, the determination ofan appropriate control premium that a market participant would apply to a reporting unit, and the determinationof appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributesof that reporting unit.
The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units
are the sales and earnings growth rates (including long-term growth rates) and discount rates. Long-term growthrates are dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment and inflation. As a result, long-term growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth or an increasedcompetitive environment. Discount rates, which are consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that islikely to be expected by a market participant, are based upon industry required rates of return, includingconsideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rates may be impacted byadverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, prolonged and continuing inflationary pressures, volatilityin the equity and debt markets and other factors that otherwise create or exacerbate risks in our reporting units.Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the futurecould reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value thatwould trigger future impairment charges of our reporting units’ goodwill. Based on our annual impairmenttesting, the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets. Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for
impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets.Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at thelowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, weestimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash flows arenot expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to theirestimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or basedon appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets togenerate separately identifiable positive cash flows. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale,we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Marketconditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factorscould necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.
Income Taxes . In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain
estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities
47
and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences
between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.
We regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is
considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income taxexpense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately berecoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all availableevidence, if we determine it is more-likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse someor all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and theestablishment of an asset in the period of reversal.
In determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of
jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existingtaxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future taxable incomeexclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.
Through the end of 2022, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain
federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, underInternal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certainstate and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.
In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex,
multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the InternalRevenue Service or other taxing authorities.
Results of Operations
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, we changed our reporting segments to align our financial reporting
with how we manage our business in strategic end markets. This is consistent with how our Chief OperatingDecision Maker (CODM) assesses our financial performance and allocates resources. As a result, we report ourfinancial performance based on the following four reportable segments: Data Center, Client, Gaming, andEmbedded.
Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 4 – Segment Reporting of the Notes to
Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the
second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions couldimpact these trends.

Data Center
Data Center net revenue of $6 billion in 2022 increased by 64%, compared to net revenue of $3.7 billion in 2021.
The increase was primarily driven by higher sales of our EPYC server processors.
Data Center operating income was $1.8 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $991 million in 2021.
The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operatingexpenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.
Client
Client net revenue of $6.2 billion in 2022 decreased by 10%, compared to net revenue of $6.9 billion in 2021,
primarily driven by a 24% decrease in unit shipment, partially offset by a 19% increase in average selling price.The decrease in unit shipments was due to challenging PC market conditions and significant inventory correctionacross the PC supply chain experienced during the second half of 2022. The increase in average selling price wasprimarily driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales.
Client operating income was $1.2 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $2.1 billion in 2021. The
decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower revenue and higher operating expenses. Operatingexpenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.
Gaming
Gaming net revenue of $6.8 billion in 2022 increased by 21%, compared to net revenue of $5.6 billion in 2021.
The increase in net revenue was driven by higher semi-custom product sales due to higher demand for gamingconsole SoCs, partially offset by lower gaming graphics sales due to a decrease in unit shipments driven by softconsumer demand given weakened macroeconomic conditions experienced in the second half of 2022.
Gaming operating income was $953 million in 2022, compared to operating income of $934 million in 2021. The
increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operatingexpenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.
49
Embedded
Embedded net revenue of $4.6 billion in 2022 increased significantly, compared to net revenue of $246 million in
2021. The significant increase in net revenue was primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded productrevenue as a result of the acquisition of Xilinx in February 2022.
Embedded operating income was $2.3 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $44 million in 2021. The
significant increase in operating income was primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded productrevenue.
All Other
All Other operating loss of $5.0 billion in 2022 primarily consisted of $3.5 billion of amortization of acquisition-
related intangibles, $1.1 billion of stock-based compensation expense, and $452 million of acquisition-relatedcosts, which primarily include transaction costs, amortization of Xilinx inventory fair value step-up adjustment,and depreciation related to the Xilinx fixed assets fair value step-up adjustment, certain compensation chargesrelated to the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, and licensing gain. All Other operating loss of $409 million in2021 primarily consisted of $379 million of stock-based compensation expense and $42 million of acquisition-related costs.
Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Licensing Gain, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense) and
Income Taxes

Gross Margin
Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 45% in 2022 compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross
margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.
Expenses
Research and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses of $5.0 billion in 2022 increased by $2.2 billion, or 76%, compared to
$2.8 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by strategic investments across all of our segments,including an increase in headcount through acquisitions and organic growth.
50
Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses
Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $2.3 billion in 2022 increased by $888 million, or 61%,
compared to $1.4 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughacquisitions and organic growth, go-to-market activities, and acquisition-related costs.
Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles
In 2022, cost of sales and operating expense included $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of amortization
expense from intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando.
Licensing Gain
During 2022, we recognized $102 million of licensing gain from milestone achievement and royalty income
associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint ventures with Higon Information TechnologyCo., Ltd., a third-party Chinese entity. We recognized a licensing gain from royalty income of $12 million for theyear ended December 25, 2021.
Interest Expense
Interest expense of $88 million in 2022 increased by $54 million compared to $34 million in 2021, primarily due
to interest expense from the 2.95% Senior Notes due 2024 and the 2.375% Senior Notes due 2030 (together, theAssumed Xilinx Notes) and the 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes issued in 2022.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income (expense), net is primarily comprised of interest income from short-term investments, changes in
valuation of equity investments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.
Other income, net was $8 million in 2022 compared to $55 million of Other income, net in 2021. The change was
primarily due to a $62 million decrease in the fair value of equity investments in 2022 compared to an increase infair value of $56 million from equity investments in 2021, partially offset by $65 million of interest incomedriven mainly by rising interest rates in 2022 compared to losses from conversion of our convertible debt of$7 million in 2021.
Income Tax Provision (Benefit)
We recorded an income tax benefit of $122 million in 2022 and an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021,
representing effective tax rates of (10%) and 14%, respectively. The reduction in income tax expense in 2022was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million foreign-derived intangible income taxbenefit and $241 million of research and development tax credits.
Through the end of fiscal year 2022, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately
$2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained isdue to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dualconsolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficientsources of future taxable income.
International Sales
International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 66% in 2022 and 72% in 2021. We expect that
international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantiallyall of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.
51
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.9 billion compared to
$3.6 billion as of December 25, 2021. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments wasprimarily driven by the $2.4 billion of cash and $1.6 billion of short-term investments acquired from the Xilinxacquisition, $1.0 billion from the debt issuance of our 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes, and cash flows fromoperations, partially offset by stock repurchases and cash paid for the acquisition of Pensando. The percentage ofcash and cash equivalents held domestically was 73% as of December 31, 2022, and 91% as of December 25,2021.
Our operating, investing and financing cash flow activities for 2022 and 2021 were as follows:

Net increase in cash and cash equivalents ............................ $ 2,300 $ 940
Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, which consisted primarily of
$1.5 billion of the Xilinx Notes assumed as part of the Xilinx acquisition and $1.0 billion of 3.924% Notes and4.393% Notes issued during the year, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021, respectively. Werepaid $312 million of our 7.50% Senior Notes that matured in August 2022.
On April 29, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and other banks identified therein as lenders. The Revolving CreditAgreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of$3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022.
On November 3, 2022, we established a new commercial paper program where we may issue unsecured
commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with amaturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or,alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time ofissuance. As of December 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding.
As of December 31, 2022, we had unconditional purchase commitments of approximately $8.6 billion, of which
$6.5 billion are in fiscal year 2023. On an ongoing basis, we work with our suppliers on the timing of paymentsand deliveries of purchase commitments, taking into account business conditions.
We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our
Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations, including capitalexpenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able toaccess the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will beavailable on favorable terms, or at all.
Operating Activities
Our working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations consist primarily of cash collections from our
customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures.
52
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion in 2022, primarily due to our net income of $1.3 billion
in 2022, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $4.1 billion and net cash outflows of $1.8 billion from changes inour operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities includeda $1.4 billion increase in inventories driven primarily by build of advanced process nodes to support the ramp ofnew products, a $1.1 billion increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by higher revenue in the fourthquarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and a $1.2 billion increase in prepaid expenses and otherassets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2022, offset by an $931 millionincrease in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, and a $546 million increase inaccrued liabilities and other driven mainly by higher customer-related accruals.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2021, primarily due to our higher net income of
$3.2 billion in 2021, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $1.1 billion and net cash outflows of $774 millionfrom changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets andliabilities included a $640 million increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by $1.6 billion higher revenuein the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, a $556 million increase in inventoriesdriven by our continued increase in product build in support of customer demand, and a $920 million increase inprepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2021,offset by an $801 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, anda $526 million increase in accrued liabilities and other, both of which were driven mainly by higher marketingaccruals, and higher accrued annual employee incentives due to improved financial performance.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $2 billion in 2022, which primarily consisted of higher cash
provided by maturities of short-term investments of $4.3 billion and cash acquired as part of the acquisition ofXilinx of $2.4 billion, partially offset by higher cash used for purchases of short-term investments of $2.7 billion,cash used in the acquisition of Pensando of $1.5 billion and $450 million for purchases of property andequipment.
Net cash used in investing activities was $686 million in 2021, which primarily consisted of higher cash used for
purchases of short-term investments of $2.1 billion and $301 million for purchases of property and equipment,partially offset by higher cash provided by maturities of short-term investments of $1.7 billion.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $3.3 billion in 2022, which primarily consisted of common stock
repurchases of $3.7 billion under the Repurchase Program, higher repurchases to cover tax withholding onemployee equity plans of $406 million and repayment of debt of $312 million, partially offset by proceeds fromthe issuance of debt of $991 million and higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employeeequity plans of $167 million.
Net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 billion in 2021, which primarily consisted of common stock
repurchases of $1.8 billion under the Repurchase Program and higher repurchases to cover tax withholding onemployee equity plans of $237 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of common stockunder our employee equity plans of $104 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment
portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequentinterest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As ofDecember 31, 2022, our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income instruments, time deposits andcommercial paper. Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preservingprincipal and meeting liquidity needs. In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with highcredit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer’s creditrating. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase.A hypothetical 50 basis-point (half percentage point) increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates atDecember 31, 2022 would have affected the fair value of our cash equivalent and investment portfolio byapproximately $2.9 million.
As of December 31, 2022, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows isminimal.
We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality
securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of anyinvestment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with activesecondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserveour invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.
We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which
we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only inhighly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believeinvolve a higher degree of risk. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of our investments in debt securitieswere A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigateinvestment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control.
Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities
that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.
We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks
associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of ourexposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
NOTE 1 – The Company
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is a global semiconductor company. References herein to AMD or the Company
mean Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. AMD’s products include x86microprocessors (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), as standalone devices or as incorporated intoaccelerated processing units (APUs), chipsets, data center and professional GPUs, embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, microprocessor and SoC development services and technology, dataprocessing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and Adaptive SoC products. From time totime, the Company may also sell or license portions of its intellectual property (IP) portfolio.
On February 14, 2022 (the Xilinx Acquisition Date), the Company completed the acquisition of Xilinx, Inc.
(Xilinx). On May 26, 2022 (the Pensando Acquisition Date), the Company completed the acquisition ofPensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). See Note 5—Business Combinations for additional information on theseacquisitions.
NOTE 2 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
Fiscal Year . The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal
2022, 2021 and 2020 ended on December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively.Fiscal 2022 consisted of 53 weeks, and fiscal 2021 and 2020 each consisted of 52 weeks.
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have beeneliminated.
Reclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affectthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of thefinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actualresults are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements.Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventoryvaluation, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an
amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods orservices. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or services areexcluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales.Substantially all the Company’s revenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performanceobligation.
Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual
terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The Company has determined that it does not have significantfinancing components in its contracts with customers.
61
Non-custom products
The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers,
which includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping termsof the sale. Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single performance obligation. CertainOEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells todistributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection onunsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM anddistributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for priceprotection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events.
The Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing
promotions, volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programscan be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized;otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenuetransaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for aportion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities,such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.
Constraints of variable consideration have not been material.
Custom products
Custom products which are associated with the Company’s Gaming segment (semi-custom products), sold under
non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which haveno alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over the time of production ofthe products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plusestimated margin, to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customerorders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate mannerto measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costsincurred best depict the Company’s satisfaction of its performance obligation.
Sales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally
involve a single performance obligation. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with customproducts.
Development and intellectual property licensing agreements
From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of
development services and a license to the right to use the Company’s IP. These arrangements are deemed to besingle or multiple performance obligations based upon the nature of the arrangements. Revenue is recognizedupon the transfer of control, over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. TheCompany evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both(i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license is not distinct, it iscombined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If thelicense is distinct, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from thelicense.
From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or
licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no performance obligations beyond transferring the designatedlicense to the Company’s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customerhas the ability to benefit from the license.
62
There are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements
or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP.
Inventories
The Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net
realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In determining excess orobsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes in business andeconomic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology orcustomer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considersassumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices.The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete.The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparingon-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as wellas anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditionsbecome less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustmentsmay be required.
Business Combinations
The Company is required to use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The acquisition
method of accounting requires the Company to allocate the purchase consideration to the assets acquired andliabilities assumed from the acquiree based on their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excessof the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed isrecorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, managementmakes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates invaluing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, futurechanges in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Fair valueestimates are based on the assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing theasset or liability. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from theestimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, theCompany may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset togoodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchaseprice of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the ConsolidatedStatements of Operations.
Goodwill
The Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and,
if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequentbasis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of animpairment.
The Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine if it is more likely than not that the
fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and marketconsiderations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specificevents. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds itscarrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.
If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
value or elects to bypass the qualitative test, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed bycomparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company’s quantitative impairment
63
analysis uses a combination of the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected
future cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparablecompanies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting units. Significant estimates and assumptions used inthe income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of reporting units in thenear- and long-term, expectations of the Company’s ability to execute on roadmaps and projections, and thediscount rate applied to cash flows. Significant estimates used in the market approach include the identificationof comparable companies for each reporting unit, and the determination of the appropriate multiples to apply to areporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit. If a reportingunit’s fair value is determined to be less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized forthe amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amountof goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets
Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential
impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewedon a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cashflows.
When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash
flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient torecover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on theexpected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affectingimpairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiablepositive cash flows.
When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, the Company estimates impairment losses as the
excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affectingimpairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition infuture periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original
maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an
allowance for credit loss. Accounts receivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent workcompleted on development services recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to customers and semi-customproducts under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contractinception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accountsreceivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months.
The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing
monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations ofall new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the Company may require letters of credit,bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments if deemed necessary. The Company maintains an allowancefor credit loss, consisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimatedpotential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and review of their current creditquality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant creditrisk.
64
Investments
Available for Sale Debt Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of
acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the relatedunrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a componentof stockholders’ equity. If an available-for-sale debt security’s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, thenthe Company evaluates whether the decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recordedthrough an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not attributable to credit losses are included,net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity.Classification of available-for-sale debt securities as current or non-current is based on the Company’s intent andbelief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months.
Non-marketable Securities. The Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of privately-held
companies are accounted for under the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted forsubsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or circumstancesindicate that a decline in value may have occurred. The Company’s periodic assessment of impairment is madeby considering available evidence, including the investee’s general market and industry conditions and productdevelopment status. The Company also assesses the investee’s ability to meet business milestones, its financialcondition, and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee’s needfor possible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company’s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for
non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies, which are generally accounted for under themeasurement alternative.
Fair Value Hierarchy
The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the
assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. The guidance for fair value measurements requires thatassets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that arenot active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantiallythe full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity
and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets andliabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cashflow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of one to 15 years for equipment, 34 to 44 years for buildings, and leaseholdimprovements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economiclives of the improvements.
65
Leases
Operating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s
balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and leaseliabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating andfinance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease paymentsover the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interestrate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses itsincremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of thelease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as theCompany has centralized treasury operations. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on astraight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the accounting policy to not recognize ROUassets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset.Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operatinglease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s finance leases are immaterial.
Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions
The functional currency of the majority of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. For certain
foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated fromforeign currencies into U.S. dollars. Gains or losses arising from translation of foreign currency denominatedassets and liabilities (i.e., cumulative translation adjustment) are included as a component of accumulated othercomprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.
Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current
exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets andliabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effectduring each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheetamounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currencyremeasurement are included in earnings.
Marketing and Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company’s marketing and advertising expenses
include certain cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs arerecorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded asmarketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fairvalue of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertisingbenefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2022, 2021and 2020 were approximately $683 million, $578 million and $314 million, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option’s
fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes model. For time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), fair value isbased on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of RSUs that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Companyestimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase plan(ESPP) using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of theapplicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to RSUs withperformance or market conditions (PRSUs), which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from theservice inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grantand revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
66
Contingencies
From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course
of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies injurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental mattersincluding local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where theCompany currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood ofany adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. Adetermination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would becharged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount ofpotential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes incircumstances such as a change in settlement strategy.
Income Taxes
The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax
assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets andliabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assetsand liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets areexpected to be realized or settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannotconclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will be realized. The assessmentrequires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable taxing jurisdictions. In addition, theCompany recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that they will besustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority.
Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). In 2022, the Company elected to change its method of accounting
for the United States GILTI tax from recording the tax impact in the period it is incurred to recognizing deferredtaxes for temporary tax basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI tax in future years. The change isconsidered preferable based on the Company’s facts and circumstances as it provides better and more timelyinformation of expected future income tax liabilities arising from temporary tax differences primarily associatedwith the Xilinx acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded $27.3 billion of identifiedintangible assets (refer to Note 5—Business Combinations), of which $16.9 billion are related to foreignoperations which will be amortized to income from operations over the assets’ estimated useful lives, but forwhich the Company will not receive a tax deduction under GILTI. This accounting policy change resulted in therecording of $857 million of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the Xilinx acquisition as disclosed inNote 14—Income Taxes. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2022, it resulted in a decrease in theincome tax provision with a corresponding increase to net income of $296 million and an increase in basic anddiluted earnings per share of $0.19, as compared to the computation under the previous accounting policy. Thisaccounting policy change had no material impact on the Company’s historical consolidated financial statements.
Accrued Interest on Unrecognized Tax Benefits. Prior to 2022, the Company reported any interest expense related
to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of Interest expense and reported any related penalties as acomponent of Income tax provision (benefit). In 2022, the Company elected to change its method of accountingfor tax interest expense from Interest expense to the Income tax provision (benefit) line in the ConsolidatedStatements of Operations. This change in classification is considered preferable as it i) better aligns classificationof tax interest with the substance of the underlying tax positions, which are managed inclusive of interest,ii) allows for greater visibility to the cost of the Company’s debt and other financing activities, and iii) betteraligns with common industry practice and provides increased comparability. This accounting policy changeresulted in a decrease in Interest expense and corresponding increase to i) Income before income taxes and equityincome and ii) Income tax provision (benefit) as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of$11 million in 2022. This accounting policy change had an immaterial effect on the Consolidated Statements ofOperations in 2021 and 2020, and the Company did not revise its previously issued consolidated financial
67
statements for these fiscal years. This accounting policy change had no impact to net income or basic and diluted
earnings per share, or to financial statements besides the Consolidated Statements of Operations, for any period,as compared to the computation under the previous accounting policy.
NOTE 3 – Supplemental Financial Statement Information
Accounts Receivable, netAs of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, Accounts receivable, net included unbilled accounts
receivable of $1.1 billion and $329 million, respectively.

Revenue
Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) include
amounts received from customers and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periodsfor development services, IP licensing and product revenue. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate transactionprice allocated to remaining performance obligations under contracts with an original expected duration of morethan one year was $247 million, of which $213 million is expected to be recognized in the next 12 months. Therevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations does not include amounts which have an originalexpected duration of one year or less.
Revenue recognized over time associated with custom products and development services accounted for
approximately 24%, 23% and 18% of the Company’s revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
NOTE 4 – Segment Reporting
Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer, reviews and assesses operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss).These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the reportable segments based onmanagement’s judgment. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company updated its segment reportingstructure to align financial reporting with the manner in which the Company manages its business in strategic endmarkets. The Company’s disclosed measure of segment operating results has been updated consistent with therevised manner in which the Company’s CODM assesses the company’s financial performance and allocatesresources. All prior-period segment data have been retrospectively adjusted.
The Company’s four reportable segments are:
• the Data Center segment, which primarily includes server CPUs and GPUs, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptive
SoC products for data centers;
• the Client segment, which primarily includes CPUs, accelerated processing units that integrate
microprocessors and GPUs (APUs), and chipsets for desktop and notebook personal computers;
• the Gaming segment, which primarily includes discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and
development services; and
• the Embedded segment, which primarily includes embedded CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs, and Adaptive
SoC products.
From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio.In addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable
segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of thereportable segments because the CODM does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the
69
performance of the reportable segments. This category primarily includes amortization of acquisition-related
intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs and licensing gain.

NOTE 5 – Business Combinations
Pensando AcquisitionOn May 26, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Pensando, a
leader in next-generation distributed computing, for a transaction valued at approximately $1.9 billion. Therecorded purchase consideration of $1.7 billion is net of deferred cash compensation requiring future services andother customary closing adjustments. The acquisition of Pensando and its leading distributed services platformexpands the Company’s ability to offer leadership solutions for cloud, enterprise, and edge customers.

Total purchase consideration ....................................................... $1,655
The Company allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on the preliminary estimates of their fair values, which were determined using generally acceptedvaluation techniques based on estimates and assumptions made by management. The fair values are subject toadjustment for up to one year after the close of the transaction as additional information is obtained. Anyadjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation identified during the measurement period are recognizedin the period in which the adjustments are determined. Adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocationsince the completion of the acquisition resulted in an immaterial decrease to goodwill.
Goodwill arising from the Pensando acquisition was assigned to the Company’s Data Center segment. Goodwill
was primarily attributed to expanded market opportunities expected to be achieved from the integration ofPensando. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Following are details of the purchase consideration allocated to acquired intangible assets:

Total identified intangible assets acquired ............................... $349
1. The fair value of developed technology was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings
method.
2. Customer relationships represent the fair value of existing contractual relationships and customer loyalty determined based on existing
relationships using the income approach, specifically the with and without method.
3. Customer backlog represents the fair value of non-cancellable customer contract orders using the income approach, specifically the
multi-period excess earnings method.
4. Product trademarks primarily relate to the Pensando product-related trademarks, and the fair value was determined by applying the
income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method.
5. The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method.
72
The fair value of the identified intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over the assets’ estimated
useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of sales andoperating expenses.
IPR&D consists of projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date.
Accordingly, the Company recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $220 million for the fair value of theseprojects, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, these projects will be tested for impairment annually andwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these projects may be impaired. Once the projectreaches technological feasibility, the Company will begin to amortize the intangible assets over their estimateduseful lives.
From the Pensando Acquisition Date to December 31, 2022, the Consolidated Statements of Operations include
immaterial revenue and operating results attributable to Pensando, which are reported under the Data Centersegment.
In 2022, Pensando acquisition-related costs of $102 million was recorded under Cost of sales, Research and
development, and Marketing, general and administrative expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements ofOperations. Acquisition-related costs are primarily comprised of direct transaction costs, fair value adjustmentsfor acquired inventory and certain compensation charges. The Company may incur additional acquisition-relatedcosts in the future related to the acquisition.
Xilinx Acquisition
On February 14, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx, a
leading provider of adaptive computing solutions, for a total purchase consideration of $48.8 billion($46.4 billion, net of cash acquired of $2.4 billion). The acquisition of Xilinx expands the Company’s productportfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across avariety of technologies. With the acquisition of Xilinx, the Company now offers FPGAs, Adaptive SoC productsand ACAP products. The purchase consideration consisted of $48.5 billion of fair value of 429 million shares ofthe Company’s common stock issued to Xilinx stockholders and $275 million of fair value of replacement equityawards attributable to services rendered pre-combination. As the transaction closed prior to the opening ofmarkets on the Xilinx Acquisition Date, the fair value of the common stock issued to Xilinx stockholders wasbased on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on February 11, 2022 of $113.18 per share.
The financial results of Xilinx are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the Xilinx
Acquisition Date to December 31, 2022 and are reported under the Embedded and Data Center segments.

The Company allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on the estimates of their fair values, which were determined using generally accepted valuationtechniques based on estimates and assumptions made by management.
Goodwill arising from the acquisition of Xilinx was assigned to the Embedded and Data Center segments.
Goodwill was primarily attributed to increased synergies expected to be achieved from the integration of Xilinx.Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Following are details of the purchase consideration allocated to acquired intangible assets:

Total identified intangible assets acquired ............................... $ 27,308
1. The fair value of developed technology was determined using the income approach, specifically, the multi-period excess earnings
method.
74
2. Customer relationships represent the fair value of existing contractual relationships and customer loyalty determined based on
existing relationships using the income approach, specifically the with and without method.
3. Customer backlog represents the fair value of non-cancellable customer contract orders using the income approach, specifically the
multi-period excess earnings method.
4. Corporate trade name and product trademarks primarily relate to the Xilinx brand and product-related trademarks, respectively, and
the fair values were determined by applying the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method.
5. The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method.
The fair value of the identified intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over the assets’ estimated
useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of sales andoperating expenses.
IPR&D consists of projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date.
Accordingly, the Company recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $970 million for the fair value of theseprojects, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, these projects are tested for impairment annually andwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these projects may be impaired. Once the projectreaches technological feasibility, the Company will begin to amortize the intangible assets over their estimateduseful life.
The Company also assumed unvested restricted stock units with estimated fair value of $1.2 billion, of which
$275 million was included as a component of the purchase consideration and $951 million will be recognized asexpense subsequent to the acquisition.

Hedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Accounting HedgesThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange
rate risk related to future forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Thesecontracts generally mature within 24 months and are designated as accounting hedges. As of December 31, 2022and December 25, 2021, the notional value of the Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward contractsdesignated as cash flow hedges was $1.9 billion and $894 million, respectively. The fair value of these contracts,recorded as a liability, was $27 million as of December 31, 2022. The fair value of these contracts as ofDecember 25, 2021 was not material.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Accounting Hedges
The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign
currency fluctuations on certain receivables or payables denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.These forward contracts generally mature within 3 months and are not designated as accounting hedges. As ofDecember 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the notional value of these outstanding contracts was $485 millionand $291 million, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was not material as of December 31, 2022 andDecember 25, 2021.
82
The cash flows associated with derivative instruments as cash flow hedging instruments are classified in the same
category in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as the cash flows of the related items.
NOTE 10 – Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
investments in time deposits, available-for-sale debt securities and trade receivables.
The Company places its investments with high credit quality financial institutions. At the time an investment is
made, investments in commercial paper of industrial firms and financial institutions are rated A1, P1, F1 orbetter. The Company invests in bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase agreements, each of whichhave securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral.
The Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a
large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company’s customer base, thus diluting the tradecredit risk. One customer accounted for approximately 18% of the total consolidated accounts receivable balanceas of December 31, 2022. Two customers each accounted for approximately 20% and 15% of the totalconsolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 25, 2021. However, the Company does not believe thereceivable balance from these customers represents a significant credit risk based on past collection experienceand review of their current credit quality.
The Company is exposed to credit losses from nonperformance by counterparties on foreign currency hedge
contracts. These counterparties are large global institutions, and to date, no such counterparty has failed to meetits financial obligations to the Company.
NOTE 11 – Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus
potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applyingthe treasury stock method to the Company’s stock options, RSUs (including PRSUs), common stock to be issuedunder the ESPP and warrants. Potentially dilutive shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.125% ConvertibleSenior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes) are calculated using the if-converted method.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company’s employee equity programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified
employees. On April 29, 2004, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, asamended and restated (the 2004 Plan). In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company introduced the 2017 ESPP, asamended and restated (the 2017 Plan).
Under the 2004 Plan, stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a three-year period from the date
of grant and expire within seven years after the grant date. Unvested shares that are reacquired by the Companyfrom forfeited outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued as new awards.
Under the 2004 Plan, the Company can grant (i) stock options, and (ii) RSUs, including time-based RSUs and
PRSUs.
Stock Options. Under the 2004 Plan, nonstatutory and incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price
of the shares subject to each nonstatutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than 100% of thefair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The exercise price of each optiongranted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise.
Time-based RSUs. Time-based RSUs are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and
that obligate the Company to issue a specific number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the future ifthe vesting terms and conditions are satisfied.
PRSUs. PRSUs can be granted to certain of the Company’s senior executives. The performance metrics can be
financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. Each PRSU award reflects a targetnumber of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on theCompany’s financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual number ofshares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 0% to 250% of the Target Sharesgranted, depending upon the degree of achievement of the performance target designated by each individualaward.
ESPP. Under the 2017 Plan, eligible employees who participate in an offering period may have up to 15% of
their eligible earnings withheld, up to certain limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of thelower of the fair market value on the first or the last business day of the six-month offering period. The offeringperiods commence in May and November each year.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 32 million shares of common stock that were available for future
grants and 28 million shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vestingof unvested RSUs, including PRSUs, under the 2004 Plan. In addition, the Company had 36 million shares ofcommon stock that were available for issuance under the 2017 plan. With the acquisition of Xilinx, the Companyassumed the Xilinx, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (2007 Plan) and may grant stock options and awards underthis plan. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 18 million shares of common stock that were available forfuture grants under the 2007 Plan.

Income tax provision (benefit) ................................ $(122) $ 513 $(1,210)
The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $122 million in 2022 and an income tax provision of
$513 million in 2021, representing effective tax rates of (10%) and 14%, respectively. The reduction in incometax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million FDII tax benefitand $241 million of research and development (R&D) tax credits.
Beginning in 2022, provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 require the Company to capitalize and
amortize R&D expenditures rather than deducting the costs as incurred. The capitalization resulted in an increasein 2022 taxable income which also increased the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit. Additionally, there wasa pre-tax loss incurred outside of the U.S. primarily due to the GAAP amortization of Xilinx acquisition-relateditems and therefore, the Company recorded a corresponding tax benefit associated with the reversal of thepreviously established GILTI deferred tax liability.
As a part of the Xilinx acquisition and as a result of certain employment and operational commitments the
Company has made in Singapore, the Company has been granted a Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI)that is effective through 2031. The DEI reduces the local tax on Singapore income from a statutory rate of 17% to5% through 2031. Due to the current year pre-tax loss, the Company did not receive any income tax or EPSbenefit.
89
The Company recorded an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021 and an income tax benefit of
$1.2 billion in 2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision in2021 was a result of higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million ofFDII benefit, $78 million of R&D tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-basedcompensation net of non-deductible officers’ compensation.
The income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance
release in the U.S. This benefit was partially offset by approximately $10 million of withholding tax expenserelated to cross-border transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes and $75 million increase in valuationallowance against certain state and foreign tax credits, which are reflected as part of the state taxes and foreignrate benefit in the reconciliation table above.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the balances for income taxpurposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022and December 25, 2021 were as follows:

As a result of the acquisition of Xilinx, the Company recorded $4.3 billion of net deferred tax liabilities primarily
on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets, including $857 million of GILTInet deferred tax liability.
Additionally, as the result of the new R&D capitalization tax law effective in 2022, the capitalized amounts
resulted in increased current year taxable income, but which are deductible as amortized in future periods.Therefore, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset for the capitalized R&D expenditures.

Under current U.S. tax law, the impact of future distributions of undistributed earnings that are indefinitely
reinvested are anticipated to be subject to withholding taxes from local jurisdictions and non-conforming U.S.state jurisdictions. The amount of cumulative undistributed earnings that are permanently reinvested that couldbe subject to withholding taxes are $460 million as of December 31, 2022.
Through the end of fiscal year 2022, the Company continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately
$2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained isdue to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dualconsolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficientsources of future taxable income.
The Company’s U.S. federal and state net operating losses carryforwards as of December 31, 2022, were
$435 million and $476 million, respectively. Net operating losses (NOLs) may be subject to limitations by theInternal Revenue Code and similar provisions. $71 million of U.S. federal NOLs will expire between 2023 and2037, and $364 million of federal NOLs have no expiration date, and the state NOLs will expire at various datesthrough 2042. The difference between the amount of federal NOLs which are recorded on the Company’sbalance sheet as deferred tax assets and their related valuation allowance, and the amounts reported on theCompany’s tax returns are the result of uncertain tax positions the Company has taken during the current yearand for which an income tax reserve has been recorded. The federal tax credits of $12 million will expire atvarious dates between 2023 and 2042. The state tax credits of $722 million will expire at various dates between2023 through 2038 except for California R&D credit, which does not expire. The Company also has $595 millionof credit carryforward in Canada that will expire between 2026 and 2040.
The Company also recorded $142 million of current tax payable as of the Xilinx acquisition date. Additionally,
the Company assumed $203 million of long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including $12 million ofinterest, as well as $321 million of long-term liabilities for transition tax payable over three years. Included in theassumed liabilities for uncertain tax positions is a tax position with respect to whether stock-based compensationfrom Xilinx’s cost sharing arrangement should be shared among cost share participants. The Company hasconcluded that the law was unsettled and believes the current uncertain tax position liability is sufficient and willcontinue to monitor developments in relevant tax court cases.

$215 million and $77 million as of December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020,respectively. The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities within theprovision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had $81.3 million ofaccrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 including$12 million assumed from the Xilinx acquisition. The Company had no material amounts of accrued interest andaccrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. As ofDecember 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the Company had long-term income tax liabilities of $1.3 billionand $189 million, respectively, recorded under Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are
subject to local country income tax. The material jurisdiction in which the Company is subject to potentialexamination by the taxing authority is the United States, where tax years from 2008 are open for audit.Pre-acquisition Xilinx U.S. tax returns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 are currently under audit by the IRS.
It is possible the Company may have tax audits close in the next 12 months that could materially change the
balance of the uncertain tax benefits; however, the timing of tax audit closures and settlements are highlyuncertain. The Company and its subsidiaries have several foreign and U.S. state audits in process at any one pointin time.

On an ongoing basis, the Company works with suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase
commitments, taking into account business conditions.
Warranties and Indemnities
The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to its approved
specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for oneyear. The Company may also offer one to three-year limited warranties based on product type and negotiatedwarranty terms with certain customers. The Company accrues warranty costs to Cost of sales at the time of saleof warranted products.
Changes in the Company’s estimated liability for product warranty during 2022 and 2021 are as follows:
December 31,
2022December 25,
2021
(In millions)
Beginning balance ..................................................... $ 5 1 $ 3 7
Provisions during the period ............................................. 1 1 5 1 0 6
Settlements during the period ............................................ (101) (92)
Ending balance ........................................................ $ 6 5 $ 5 1
In addition to product warranties, the Company from time to time in its normal course of business indemnifies
other parties with whom it enters into contractual relationships, including customers, lessors and parties to othertransactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. In these limited matters, the Company has agreedto hold certain third parties harmless against specific types of claims or losses such as those arising from a breachof representations or covenants, third-party claims that the Company’s products when used for their intendedpurpose(s) and under specific conditions infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, or otherspecified claims made against the indemnified party. It is not possible to determine the maximum potentialamount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the unique facts and circumstances that arelikely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. Historically, payments made by theCompany under these obligations have not been material. In addition, the impact from changes in estimates forpre-existing warranties has been immaterial.

Environmental Matters
The Company is named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale,
California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, the Company has discovered hazardous materialreleases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conductremediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in thesemiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.
In 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with otherresponsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assumemost of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders.The Company remains responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as allremaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.
To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an
estimated environmental liability of approximately $3.9 million and has not recorded any potential insurancerecoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot bepredicted with certainty and these costs may change. The Company believes that any amount in addition to whathas already been accrued would not be material.
Other Legal Matters
The Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With
respect to these matters, based on the management’s current knowledge, the Company believes that the amountor range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materialadverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Inour opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position ofthe Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cashflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generallyaccepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022,based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressedan unqualified opinion thereon.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of
accounting for the United States Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax to recognize deferred taxesfor temporary tax basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI tax in future years.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firmregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance withthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and ExchangeCommission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of materialmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks ofmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures thatrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts anddisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used andsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financialstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Inventory Valuation
Description of the
MatterAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s net inventory balance was
$3,771 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,the Company adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost orthe estimated net realizable value after completing ongoing reviews of on-handinventory quantities exceeding forecasted demand and by considering recenthistorical activity as well as anticipated demand. Auditing management’sinventory carrying value adjustments involved significant judgment because theestimates are based on several factors that are affected by market, industry, andcompetitive conditions outside the Company’s control. In estimating inventorycarrying value adjustments, management developed assumptions such asforecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive tothe competitiveness of product offerings, customer requirements, and productlife cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could beaffected by future economic and market conditions.
How We
Addressed theMatter in OurAuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating
effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s inventory carrying valueadjustment determination process, including the basis for developing the above-described assumptions and management’s judgments.
Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of
management’s key assumptions and judgments and testing the accuracy andcompleteness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of inventorycarrying value adjustments. For instance, we compared the quantities andcarrying value of on-hand inventories to related unit sales, both historical andforecasted, assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimates of futuresales prices by analyzing historical sales and evaluating any factors that mayimpact sales prices, and evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy ofmanagement’s adjustments to such sales forecasts by analyzing potentialtechnological changes in line with product life cycles. We also assessed theaccuracy of forecasts underlying management’s estimates by comparingmanagement’s historical forecasts to actual results, evaluated industry andmarket factors and performed sensitivity analyses over the significantassumptions used by management to evaluate necessary changes in theinventory carrying value adjustments.
Business Combination
Description of theMatterDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Xilinx, Inc.
(“Xilinx”) for consideration of $48.8 billion, as disclosed in Note 5 to theconsolidated financial statements. The transaction was accounted for as abusiness combination.
Auditing the Company’s accounting for its acquisition of Xilinx was complex
due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the Company’s determination ofthe fair value of certain identified intangible assets, principally consisting ofdeveloped technology and customer relationships. The significant estimationuncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values tounderlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business.The Company used a discounted cash flow model to measure the developedtechnology and customer relationship intangible assets. The significantassumptions used to estimate the value of these intangible assets included
98
Business Combination
certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results, specifically,
revenue growth rates, technology migration curves, and time to recreatecustomer relationships. These significant assumptions are forward looking andcould be affected by future economic and market conditions.
How We
Addressed theMatter in OurAuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating
effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting for the acquisition.This included testing controls over the estimation process supporting therecognition and measurement of the developed technology and customerrelationships intangible assets, including the valuation models and underlyingassumptions used to develop such estimates.
To test the estimated fair value of the developed technology and customer
relationships intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included,among others, evaluating the Company’s selection of the valuationmethodology, evaluating the methods and significant assumptions used by theCompany, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying datasupporting the significant assumptions and estimates. For example, wecompared the significant assumptions to current industry, market and economictrends and to the Company’s budgets and forecasts, and Xilinx’s historicaloperating results. We involved our valuation specialists to assist with ourevaluation of the methodology used by the Company and significantassumptions included in the fair value estimates. Our valuation specialists’procedures included, among others, developing a range of independent estimatesfor the discount rates used in the valuation models and comparing those to thediscount rates selected by management.

Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanyingManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinionon the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firmregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance withthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and ExchangeCommission and the PCAOB.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes inaccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reportingincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonableassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordancewith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being madeonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonableassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of thecompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
100
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk thatcontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with thepolicies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed with the objective of providing reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specifiedin the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisionsregarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, ourmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provideonly reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to applyits judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
As of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and ChiefFinancial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedurespursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterlybasis so that conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q andForm 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modifythem as necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that we adjust ascircumstances merit. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concludedthat our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of theperiod covered by this report.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and otherpersonnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation offinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, andincludes those policies and procedures that:
1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company;
2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expendituresof the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of theCompany; and
3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Internal controlover financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because ofits inherent limitations.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject
to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting
102
also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a
risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control overfinancial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting forthe Company.
Management has used the 2013 framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated
Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluatethe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that theCompany’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 at the reasonableassurance level. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued anattestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, which isincluded in Part II, Item 8, above.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recently completed
fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls overfinancial reporting. We are currently in the process of integrating the Xilinx and Pensando operations, controlprocesses and information systems into our systems and control environment. We believe that we have taken thenecessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting during thisintegration.
ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION
