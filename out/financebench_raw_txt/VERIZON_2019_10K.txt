Verizon Comm unications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’ s leading providers of communications,
information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video
services and solutions on our networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility , reliable network connectivity , security and control.  Formerly known as Bell
Atlantic Corporation (Bell Atlantic), we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delawa re. We began doing business as Verizon on June 30, 2000 following
our mer ger with GTE Corporation. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately  135,000  employees as of December 31, 2019 .
Our principal executive of fices are located at 1095 A venue of the Americas, New Y ork, New Y ork 10036 (telephone number 212-395-1000).
In November 2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business.  Under the new structure, effective April 1, 2019, there are two reportable segments that we
operate and manage as strategic business units  - Verizon Consumer Group ( Consumer ) and Verizon Business Group ( Business ).
Verizon Consumer Gr oup
Our Consume r segment provides consumer -focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most
extensive wireless networks in the United States  (U.S.) under the Verizon brand and through wholesale and other arrangements. Our wireline services are provided in nine
states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic  network under the Fios brand and over a traditional copper -based
network to customers who are not served by Fios.  In 2019 , the Consumer segment’ s revenues were $91.1 billion , representing approximately 69% of Verizon’ s consolidated
revenues. As of December 31, 2019 , Consumer had approximately 95 million  wireless retail connections, 6 million  broadband connections and 4 million  Fios video
connections.
Verizon Business Gr oup
Our Business  segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed
network servi ces, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various  Internet of Things  (IoT)  services and products. We provide these products and
services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world.  In 2019 , the
Business segment's revenues were $31.4 billion , representing  approximate ly 24% of Verizon’ s consolidated revenues. As of December 31, 2019 , Business had approximately
25 million  wireless retail postpaid connections and approximately 489 thousand  broadband connections.
Additional discussion of our reportable segments is included in the 2019  Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders under the headings "Management’ s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview" and - "Segment Results of Operations" and in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon
Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which are incorporated by reference into this report.
Service and Product Offerings
Our Consume r segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on

Enterprise, Small and Medium Business, Public Sector and Other , and Wholesale.
Wireless
We offer wireless services and equipment to customers of both Consumer and Business.
Wireless Services
Our Consumer and Busine ss segments provide a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Customers can obtain our wireless services on a
postpaid or prepaid basis.  Retail  (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers that are directly served and managed by Verizon and use Verizon
branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. A retail postpaid connection represents an individual line of
service for a wireless device for which a customer is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly  access charge in return for access to and usage of network services.
Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance.
Approximately 96% of our Consumer retail connections were postpaid connections as of December 31, 2019 .

our facilities to provide services to their customers.  In 2019 , Wholesale revenues were $3.2 billion , representing  approximate ly 10% of Business’ s total revenues. A portion of
Wholesale revenues are generated by a few lar ge telecommunications companies, most of which compete directly with us. Wholesale's services include:
• Data services . We offer a portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our Wholesale customers’ networks and provide connections to their
end-users and subscribers.
• Voice services . We provide switched access services that allow carriers to complete their end-user calls that originate or terminate within our territory . In addition, we
provide originating and terminating voice services throughout the U.S. and globally utilizing our TDM and V oIP networks.
• Local services.  We offer an array of local dial tone and broadband services to competitive local exchange carriers, some of which are of fered to comply with
telecommunications regulations. In addition, we of fer services such as colocation, resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with applicable regulations.
Distribution
We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels to market and distribute our products and services to Consumer customers.
Our direct channel, includ ing our company-operated stores, is a core component of our distribution strategy . Our sales and service centers also represent a significant
distribution channel for our services.
Our indirect/d igital partners channel includes agents that sell our wireless and wireline products and services at retail locations throughout the U.S., as well as through the
Internet. The majority of these sales are made under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also have relationships with high-profile national retailers that sell our wireless

In addition to our direct channel, our Business segme nt has additional distribution channels that include business solution fulfillment provided by resellers, non-stocked device
fulfillment performed by distributors and integrated mobility services provided by system integrators and resellers.
Competition and Related Trends
The telecommunications industry is highly competitive. W e expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased market share.
6
Table of Contents
With respect to our wireles s connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireles s service providers, including AT&T Inc., Sprint Corporation and T-
Mobile USA,  Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless
service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their customers. Resellers may include cable companies.  Competition  remains intense as a result of high rates of
smartphone penetration in the wireless market, increased network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, such as 5G, the
introduction of new products and services, offerings that include additional premium content, new market entrants, the availability of additional licensed and unlicensed
spectrum, and regulatory changes. In 2019, we bega n offering Apple Music and Disney+ to customers as part of their Unlimited plans. Competition may also increase as
smaller , stand -alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers and as MVNOs resell wireless communication
services.
We also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the
provision of wireless produ cts and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and others
are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider ’s voice service, as well as alternative means of
accessing video content.
With respect to our wireli ne connectivity services, we compete against cable companies, wireless service providers, domes tic and foreign telecommunications providers,
satellite television companies, Internet service provi ders,  over-the-top (OTT)  providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions.
Cable operato rs have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital produ cts and services. We introduced offerings that provide customized
Internet and video packages. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services throug h strategic relationships. Customers have more choices for obtaining
video content from various online services. We expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to OTT offerings. We expect customer migration from
traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a
landline alternative. W e also face increasing competition from cable operators and other providers of V oIP services, as well as Internet portal providers.
We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the telecommunications industry:
• Network r eliability , speed and coverage.  We consider networks that consistently provide high-quality , fast and reliable service to be a key different iator in the market
and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to
increased customer usage of connectivity services. We and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing capacity usage
requirements and of fer highly reliable national coverage.
• Pricing. With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape.  As the deman d for wireless services
continues to grow , wireless  service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices.  Many wireless service providers also bundle wireless service
offerings with other products and offer promotional  pricing and incentives, some of which may be targeted specifically to customers of Verizon. We and other
wireless servi ce providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a
period of time, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements.  In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more common in an effort to gain a
greater share of subscribers  interested in changing carriers. With respect to wireline services, pricing is used by competitors to capture market share from incumbents,
and it is a significant facto r as non-traditional modes  of providing communication services emer ge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and
portal-based voice and video calling is often free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues.
• Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other
providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and
focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. The Verizon Up program, for example, was launched to promote long-term
relationships with our Consumer customers. The program offers a variety of rewards to customers in exchange for points in connection with their account-related
transactions.
Customer service is highly valued by our Business customers. We provide Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other customers with ready access to their system
and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of our networks to identify issues before they affect our customers. We service our Small and
Medium Business custome rs through service representatives and online support, as well as through store-based representatives for small business customers. For
Wholesale customers, we pursue service improvement through continued system automation initiatives.
• Product differ entiation.  Customer and revenue growth are increasingly depen dent on the development of new and enhanced products and services, as the delivery of
new and innovative produc ts and services has been accelerating. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their
broadband, video and wireless connections. To compete effectively , providers need to continuously revie w, improve and refine their product portfolio and develop
and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of customers. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and
innovative products and services, both independently and in collaboration with application providers, content providers and device manufacturers. Features such as
wireless and wireline inter -operability are becoming increasingly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement.
7
Table of Contents
• Sales and distribution. A key to achieving sales success in the consumer and small and medium business sectors of the wireless industry is the reach and quality of
sales channels and distribu tion points. We seek to optimally vary distribution channels among our compa ny-operated stores selling wireless products and services,
outside sales teams and telemarketing, web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, our extensive indir ect distribution network of retail outlets and our sale of
wireless service to resellers, which resell wireless services to their end-users.
In addition to these competitive factors and trends, companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in  our Business segment. A relatively small number of
telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market.
We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand
recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may af fect our future revenue growth.
In the Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other markets, competition remains high, primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology conver gence. We
compete in this area with system integrators, carriers, and hardware and software providers. In addition, some of the largest information technology services companies are
making strate gic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets and forging new alliances to improve their cost structure. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on
emer ging fields, such as cloud computing, software defined network, communication applications and other computing tasks via networks, rather than by the use of in-house
machines.
In the Small and Medium Business market, customer  purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution speed and simplicity with user interfaces that have a
consumer -like "look and feel" are becoming key differentiators for customers who are seeking full life-cy cle offers that simplify the process of starting, running and growing
their businesses. Several major cable operators also of fer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships.
Our Wholesale business competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition , mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless
backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this business opportunity .

and operated and third-party search properties as well as mail, news, finance, sports and entertainme nt offerings, and provides other businesses and partners access to

Global Network and Technology
Our global network architecture is used by both Consumer and Business. Our network technology platforms include both wireless and wireline technologies.
Network Evolution
We are evolving the architecture of our networks to a next-generation multi-use platform, providing improved efficiency and virtualization, increased automation and
opportunities for edge computing services that will support both our fiber-based and radio access network technologies. We call this the Intelligent Edge Network. We expect
that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, improve our fourth-generation ( 4G) Long-T erm Evolution ( LTE) wireless coverage,
speed the deployment of  5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market.
5G Deployment
Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services.
We believe 5G technology  will be able to provide users with eight capabilities, or currencies. The eight currencies are peak data rates, mobile data volumes, mobility , number
of connected devices, energy efficiency of connected  devices, service deployment, reduced latency and improved reliability . We expect that 5G technology will provide higher
throughput and lower latency than the current 4G LTE technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of Internet-connected devices grows. During
2018, we commercially launched 5G Home on proprietary standards in four U.S. markets and on global  standards in a fifth U.S. market in 2019. We also launched our 5G
Ultra W ideband Network in 31 U.S. markets in 2019, as well as several 5G-compatible smartphones.
4G L TE
Our primary wireless netw ork technology platform is 4G LTE, which provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by
3G technology . As of December 31, 2019 , our 4G LTE network is available in over 700 markets covering approximately 327 million people, includi ng those in areas served by
our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we have collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carrier ’s
network assets and our core 4G L TE equipment and 700 Megahertz (MHz) C Block and Advanced W ireless Services (A WS) spectrum.
Wireless Network Reliability and Build-Out
We consider the reliability , coverage and speed of our wireless network as key factors for our continued success. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform
investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services. As we design and deploy our network, we focus on the number of successful data sessions the
network enables, delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We
utilize three strategies to maintain the quality of our network: increasing the density of our network elements, deploying new technologies as they are developed and putting
additional wireless spectrum into service. W e choose among these strategies based on the circumstances present at dif ferent times in each of our service areas.
We have been densifying our network by utilizing small cell technology , in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add
capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks.  We are also utilizing
existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer experience. We continue to deploy advanced technologies to increase
both network capacity and data rates.
In order to build and upgrade our existing 4G LTE network and deploy our 5G network, we must comp lete a variety of steps, which can include securing rights to a large
number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities, for our macro and small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related
radio equipment that comp rise distributed antenna systems. We have relationships with a wide variety of vendors that supply various products and services that support our
wireless network operations. W e utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing leased and owned tower sites.
Our networks include various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of the services provided to our customers. T o mitigate the impact of power disruptions
on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every macro cell. W e also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macro cells and at every switch location.
In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label
Switching backbone network in critical locations.
In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless servi ce providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in
nearly all other areas in the U.S. where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming
arrangements with wireless service providers outside the U.S.
Fios
Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow . We expect the
continued emergence of new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for
increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios positions us well to meet these demands in a cost-
effective and ef ficient manner .

Table of Contents
While deploy ed initially as a consumer broadband network, our PON infrastructure is also experiencing more widespread application in the Business segment, especially as
businesses increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services.
Global IP
Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber-optic networks in the world, providing connectivity to Business customers in more than 150 countries. Our global IP
network includes long-haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 1 million route miles and enable and support international operations.
Global business is rapidly evolving to an "everything-as-a-service" model in which Business customers seek cloud-based, conver ged enterprise solutions delivered securely via
managed and professional services. W e are continuing to deploy packet optical transport technology in order to create a global network platform to meet this demand.
Spectrum
The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobil e wireless voice, video and data communications services. We are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) to provide these wireless services on porti ons of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellula r spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal
Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively ,
cover nearly all of the population of the U.S. This spectrum is collectively called low and mid-band spectrum. We are using our low and mid-band spectrum to provide both 3G
and 4G LTE wireless services. However , we are incre asingly reallocating spectrum previously used for 3G service to provide 4G LTE service. We are also repurposing low and
mid-band spectrum to complement our spectrum licenses in the 28 and 39 Gigahertz (GHz) band, collectively called millimeter wave spectrum.
Millimeter wave spectrum  is being used for our 5G technology deployment. We anticipate that we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing
demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband servic es that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed, as well
as the wider deployment of 5G mobile and fixed services. We can meet our future 4G and 5G spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or
by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur .
From time to time we have  exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue
similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future . In certain cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum swaps
designed to increase the amount of contiguous spect rum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency .
These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals.
Information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in the 2019  Verizo n Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 3 to the consolidated finan cial statements of
Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.
Strategic Transactions
During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to
lease and operate approxim ately 11,300 of our wireless towers and corresponding ground leases for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the
towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew. Under the terms of the lease agreements, American Tower has
exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases  expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire
these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $71 million.
In June 2015, we complete d our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL), a leader in digital content and advertisi ng. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing

May 2017.
In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreem ent to acquire XO Holdings' wireline business (XO), which owned and operated one of the largest fiber-based IP and
Ethernet networks in the U.S. Concurrently , we entered into a separate agreement to utilize certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO Holdings,
NextLink, that held XO's millimeter -wave wireless spectrum. The agreement included an option, subjec t to certain conditions, to acquire NextLink. In February 2017, we
completed our acquisition of XO for total cash consideration of approximately $1.5 billion , of which $100 million  was paid in 2015.
In April 2017, we exercise d our option to buy NextL ink for approximately $493 million , subjec t to certain adjustm ents, of which $320 million  was prepaid in the first quarter
of 2017. The transaction closed in January 2018. The acquisition of NextLink was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired
spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded approximately $657 million  of wireless licenses, $110 million  of a deferred tax liability and $58 million  of other liabilities.
In June 2017,  we completed our acquisition of the operating business of Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo), a leader in search, communications, digital content and advertising. Pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement, upon the terms and subjec t to the conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoo’ s
operating business for approximately $4.83 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. In February 2017, Verizon and Yahoo entered into an amendment to the Purchase
Agreement, pursuant to which the T ransaction purchase price was reduced by $350 million to approximately $4.48 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments.
In August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from WideOpenW est, Inc. (WOW!) , a leading
provider of communication s services. The transactio n closed in December 2017. In addition, the parties entered into a separate agreement pursuant to which WOW! was to
complete the build-out of the network assets in 2019. This build-out was completed in 2019. The total cash consideration for the transactions was approximately  $275 million ,
of which $226 million  was paid in December 2017. During 2019 and 2018, the remaining cash consideration was paid.
In 2017, we entered into a transaction to acquire Strai ght Path Communications Inc., which held certain millimeter -wave spectrum licenses. The transaction closed in February
2018 for total consideration reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $3.1 billion . We are using the spectrum acquired for our 5G technology deployment.
Additional information regarding certain of these strategic transactions is included in the 2019  Verizo n Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 3  to the consolidated financial
statements of V erizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue
the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad.
We also activ ely grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable
them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their produc ts and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage
of the results  of Verizon’ s research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration for Verizon, we do not believe that the loss of such
consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material ef fect on our results of operations.
We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We
also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us
directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we sell to our customers, if successful , could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the
relevant products or services.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
Information about our acqu isitions and divestitures is included in the 2019 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders under the heading "Management’ s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Acquisitions and Divestitures" and in Note 3  to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and

Regulatory and Competitive Trends
Regulatory and Competitive Landscape
Verizon opera tes in a regulated and highly competi tive market. Current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers, such as other wireless
companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers and other non-traditional competitors. Many of
these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to a highly competitive market that may affect our
future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary
regulator . The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act
or Act). Other V erizon services are subject to state and local regulation.
Federal, State and Local Regulation
Wireless Services
The FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally , the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition and transfer of wireless
communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. Verizon
anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. We can meet our needs for license d spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others,
or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions.
Today , Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC
spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While  the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’ s wireless licenses,
challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that
license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers
to use device s and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including
construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless
tower and antenna facilities.
The Act generally preempt s regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating
the other "terms and condit ions" of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements. Several
states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna
facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.
Broadband
Verizon offers many different broadband services. Traditionally , the FCC recognized broadband Internet  access services as "information services" subject to a "light touch"
regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. In 2015, the FCC declared that broadband Internet access services are "telecommunications
services" subject to commo n carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. In December 2017, the FCC adopted an order reversing the 2015 Title II Order to
return to "light touch" regulation of broadband Intern et access services. The "light touch" portions of this order have been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Circuit but further appeals are likely . The part of the FCC order automatically preempting state action on the subject was vacated, and a number of states are likely to join those
that have taken steps to regulate broadband. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed to the open Internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and
unblocked access to lawful websites and content, and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at http://responsibility .verizon.com/broadband-
commitment.
Wireline V oice
Verizon offers many different wireline voice services,  including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes,
legacy telephone services are generally considered to be "common carrier" services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to
rates, terms and conditions  and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply
with certain rules, such as 91 1 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements.
State public utility commissions regulate Verizon’ s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an "incumbent local
exchange carrier" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and
requirements. V erizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated.
Video
Verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also
generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local
government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result.

Privacy and Data Security
We are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business, including wireline, wireless,
broadband and the develop ment and roll out of new products, such as those in the media and IoT space. At the federal level, our voice business is subject to the FCC's privacy
requirements. Oversight of broadband Internet access privacy and data security is governed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Generally , attention to privacy and data
security requirements is increasing at both the state and federal level, and several privacy-related bills have been introduced or are under considerations at each level. Europe's
General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, a new privacy law took effect in
California at the beginning  of 2020, an additional privacy law is scheduled to take effect in Maine in 2020, and other states are considering additional regulations. These
regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.
Public Safety and Cybersecurity
The FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emer gency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media
(broadcast/cable) and wireless emer gency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurre d or could occur in the future, however , the FCC or other regulators
may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersec urity practices of providers. The FCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by
companies imposing potential national security risks, but Verizon does not use such equipment in its network. In addition, due to recent natural disasters, federal and state
agencies may attempt to impose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters.
Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access
The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other
aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline "business data services" and other
services and network facili ties. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. The FCC has focused in recent
years on whether changes in the rates, terms and conditions for both the exchange of traf fic and for business data services may be appropriate.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors
The following discussion of "Risk Factors" identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect  our business, operations, financial condition or futur e performance.
This information should be read in conjunction with "Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Result of Operations" and the consolidated financial
statements and related notes. The following discuss ion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when
evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our futur e results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in
forwar d-looking statements.
Operational Risks
Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business.
Cyber attacks , including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for
obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse
effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable
technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations. Cybe r attacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased in
frequency , scope and poten tial harm in recent years. They may occur alone or in conjunction with physical  attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the
attacker . The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating to address their increasing prevalence
and sophistication. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to Verizon's operations or financial
condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insuf ficient to repel or
mitigate the ef fects of a major cyber attack in the future.
The inability to operate or use our networks and syste ms or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of
time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon
could include  expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their busin ess, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of
alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. Further , certain of Verizon’ s businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure
and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively af fected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack.
Our presence in the IoT industry , which includes offerings of telematics products and services, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and
reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. In addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable
information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these
occurrences could damage  our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on Verizon’ s results of operation or
financial condition.
Natural disasters, terr orist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructur e and r esult in significant disruptions to our operations.
Our business operations are subject to interruption by power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and natural disasters, including an increasing prevalence of wildfires
and intensified storm activities. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely , resulting in degradation or disruption
of service to our customers, as well as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain our
operations through all such events. We are implementing, and will continue to implement, measures to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of these
events in the future, but these measures and our overall disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure
of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. These occurrences could result in
lost revenues from business interruption, damage to our reputation and reduced profits.
We depend on key suppliers and vendors to pr ovide equipment that we need to operate our business.
We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as fiber, switch and network equipment,
smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide produc ts to our customers. For example, our smartphone and other device
suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets , used in their devices, and there are a limited number of companies
capable of supplying the network infrastructure equipment on which we depend. These suppliers or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis, or fail
to meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including, for example, disruption to the global supply chain as a result of the coronavirus. If such failures
occur , we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers, or we may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks.
Because of the cost and time lag that can be associate d with transitioning from one supplier to another , our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or
chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on
short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.
The suppliers and vendors  on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent
infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry . We are unable to predict whether our
15
Table of Contents
business will be af fected by any such litigation. W e expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology .
A significant portion of our workfor ce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the
renegotiation of our labor contracts.
As of December 31, 2019 , approximately 23% of our workf orce was represented by labor unions. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent
negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. In addition, while a small percentage of
the workforce  of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline is represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing
this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations.
Economic and Strategic Risks
We face significant competition that may r educe our pr ofits.
We face significant competition in our industries. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products have eliminated many of the traditional distinctions
among wireless, cable, Internet and local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable
companies, wireless servic e providers, satellite providers and application and device providers. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and
services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. If we are unable to compete effectively , we could experience lower
than expected revenues and earnings. A projected sustained decline in any of our reporting units' revenues and earnings could have a significant impact on its fair value and has
caused us in the past, and may cause us in the future, to record goodwill impairment charges. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial
relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases
specifically targeting our customers. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality , capacity and coverage, the pricing of our
products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced produ cts and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution
channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries, including new technologies
and business models, changes in consumer prefere nces and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond
successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits.
If we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and addr ess changing consume r demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the
demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience r educed pr ofits.
Our industries  are rapidly changing as new technolog ies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the
markets we serve. In order  to grow and remain comp etitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology , enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings
to address our customers’ changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose
customers to our competitors. W e may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market.
The deployment of our 5G network is subject to a variety of risks, including those related to equipment availability , unexpected costs, and regulatory permitting requirements
that could cause deployment delays or network perfo rmance issues. These issues could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the enhancements to our
networks. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implem entation and introduction of these services materially increase, our
ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely af fected.
In addition to introducing new offerings and technolo gies, such as 5G technology , we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to
do so on a cost-ef fective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services.
Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our r esults of operations.
Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession  or economic slowdown in the U.S. or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our
products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer
higher margin services, dropping down in price plans  or obtaining lower -cost products and services offered  by other companies. Similarly , under these conditions, the business
customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic
conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur , it could have a material
adverse ef fect on our results of operations.

Regulatory and Legal Risks
Changes in the r egulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business pr ospects or r esults of operations.
Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencie s, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign
governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified
products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often
involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the
outcome of pending federa l and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing
laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly , we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in
obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10
years, subject  to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a mate rial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level, such as those described below , or new laws or
regulations enacted to address the potential impacts of climate change, could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our Media
business, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our
customers.
• Privacy and data protection  - we are subject to federal, state and international  laws related to privacy and data protection. Europe's General Data Protection
Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, a new privacy law took effect in California at the
beginning of 2020, an additional privacy law is scheduled to take effect in Maine in 2020, and other states are considering additional regulations. These regulations
could have a significant impact on our businesses.
• Regulation of broadband Internet access services  - In its 2015 Title II Order, the FCC nullified its longstanding "light touch" approach to regulating broadband
Internet access services and "reclassified" these services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. The FCC repealed the
2015 Title II Order in December 2017, and returned to its traditional light-touch approach for these servi ces. The 2017 order has been affirmed in part by the D.C.
Circuit, but further appeals and challenges are possible; the outcome and timing of these or any other challenge remains uncertain. Several states have also adopted or
are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements  on some of our services (in some cases different from the
FCC’ s 2015 rules). The enforceability and ef fect of these state rules is uncertain.
• "Open Access"  - we hold certain wireles s licenses that require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC regula tions, which generally require licensees of
particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover , certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the
FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services.
The further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return
we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks.
We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could r equir e us to pay significant damages or settlements.
We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and
hour class actions, persona l injury claims, property claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also
faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant expenses in
defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.
Financial Risks
Verizon has significant debt, which could incr ease further if V erizon incurs additional debt in the futur e and does not r etire existing debt.
As of December 31, 2019 , Verizon had approximately $99.1 billion  of outstanding unsecured  indebtedness, $9.4 billion  of unused borrowing capacity under its existing
revolving credit facility and $12.4 billion  of outstanding secured indebtedness. Verizon’ s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences,
including:
• requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt, which would reduce
the funds V erizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions;
• making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt
refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;
• reducing V erizon’ s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industries and market conditions;
• making V erizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and
17
Table of Contents
• exposing V erizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates.
Adverse changes in the cr edit markets and other factors could incr ease our borr owing costs and the availability of financing.
We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets.
Adverse chan ges in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borro wing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our
operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our ability to obtain funding under asset-backed debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to originate a
sufficient amount of assets eligible to be securitized. Our borrowing costs also can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies,
which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing
and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financi ng. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do
business, and such instability could also af fect our access to financing.
Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and r etiree healthcar e benefits may r educe our pr ofitability and incr ease our funding commitments.
With approximately 135,000  employees and approximately 191,000 retirees as of December 31, 2019  eligibl e to participate in Verizon’ s benefit plans, the costs of pension
benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability . Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for
these plans, are affected by several factors, including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding  the potential modification of the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality
assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce
our profitability and increase our funding commitments.
Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments
None.
Item 2.    Properties
Our principal properties do not lend themselves to simple description by character and location. Our total gross investment in property , plant and equipment was approximately
$266 billion  at December 31, 2019  and $253 billion  at December 31, 2018 , including the effect of retirements, but before deducting accumulated depreciation. Our gross
investment in property , plant and equipment consisted of the following:
At December 31, 2019  2018
Network equipment 77.3% 78.0%
Land, buildings and building equipment 12.0% 12.4%
Furniture and other 10.7% 9.6%
 100.0 % 100.0 %
Network equipment consists primarily of cable (aerial, buried, under ground or undersea) and the related  support structures of poles and conduit, wireless plant, switching
equipment, network software, transmission equipmen t and related facilities. Land, buildings and buildin g equipment consists of land and land improvements, central office
buildings or any other buildings that house network equipment, and buildings that are used for administrative and other purposes. Substantially all the switching centers are
located on land and in buildings we own due to their critical role in the networks and high set-up and relocation costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the U.S.
comprised of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail sales locations, garage work centers, switching centers, cell sites and data centers. Furniture and
other consists of telephone equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, of fice equipment, motor vehicles, plant under construction and leasehold improvements.
Item 3.    Legal Proceedings
In Octo ber 2013, the California Attorney General’ s Office notified certain Verizon companies of potent ial violations of California state hazardous waste statutes primarily
arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilitie s. We are cooperating with this investigation and continue to review
our operations relating to the management of hazard ous waste. While penalties relating to the alleged violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties
ultimately incurred will be material.
Item 4.    Mine Safety Disclosures

Item 5.    Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
The principal market for trading in the common stock of Verizon is the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "VZ". As of December 31, 2019 , there were 605,414
shareholders of record.
Stock Repurchases
In February 2020, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of the Company's common stock. The program
will terminate  when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches  100 million, or a new share repurchase plan superseding the curre nt plan is authorized, whichever is
sooner . Under the program, share s may be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions, on the open market, or otherwise, including through plans complying with Rule
10b5-1 under the Exchange  Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on market conditions and the Company's capital allocation
priorities.
During the years ended December 31, 2019  and 2018 , Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon’ s common stock under our previously authorized share buyback
program. At December 31, 2019, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of V erizon under our share buyback program was 100 million.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’ s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which
is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for ef fective internal control established
in Internal Control–Integra ted Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief
Executive Of ficer and Chief Financial Of ficer have concluded that the registrant’ s disclosure controls and procedures were ef fective as of December 31, 2019 .
In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that are intended
to ensure an effective internal control environment. There were no changes in the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2019  that
have materially af fected, or are reasonably likely to materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’ s report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of Verizon’ s independent registered public accounting firm are included in the 2019
Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders and are incorporated herein by reference.

Interest on each series of Notes is payable annually in arrears and will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being
calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on such series (or the date of initial issuance of such series, if no interest
has been paid on such serie s), to but excluding the next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined by
the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association.
If interest or principal on any of the 2.375% 2022 Notes, 0.500% 2022 Notes, 1.625% 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, 3.250% 2026 Notes, 1.375% 2026 Notes, 2027

Sunday or any other day when commercial banks are not open for business in The City of New Y ork or London or any day on which the T rans- European Automated Real-time
Gross settlement Express Transfer payment system or any successor thereto is not open for transfer of payments, we will make the payment on the next succeeding business
day in such locations, and no additional interest will accrue as a result of the delay in payment. If interest  or principal on any of the 4.073% 2024 Notes, 1.875 % 2030 Notes,
2.500% 2031 Notes, 2034 Notes, 2035 Notes and 2036 Notes (collectively , the “Sterling Notes”)  is payable on a Saturday , Sunday or any other day when commercial banks are
not open for business in The City of New York or London, we will make the payment on the next business day in such locations, and no additional interest will accrue as a
result of the delay in payment.
We may issue additional Notes of any series in the future.
Ranking
Each series of Notes is unsecured and ranks equally with all of our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
Curr ency Conversion
All payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any , including any payments made upon any redemption, on the Euro Notes will be payable in euro.
All payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any , including any payments made upon any redemption, on the Sterling Notes will be payable in GBP .
If either euro or GBP, as applicable, is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control (including the
dissolution of the euro), then all payments in respect of the relevant Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until euro or GBP, as the case may be, is again available to us. The
amount payable on any date in euro or GBP, as applicable, will be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as of the close of business
on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the latest
U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate or U.S. dollar/GBP exchange rate, as applicable, available on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date as
determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the Notes alternatively made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Notes or the
Indenture.

For book-entry only debt securities, we wire principal and interest payments to DTC’ s nominee. We and the trustee treat DTC’ s nominee as the owner of the global
securities for all purposes . Accordingly , neither we nor the trustee have any direct responsibility or liability to pay amounts due on the debt securities issued under the
Indenture to owners of beneficial interests in the global securities.
Under book-e ntry only form, we have not issued physical certificates representing beneficial interests in the global securities to individual holders of the debt
securities. Beneficial interests in global securities will be shown on, and transfers of global securities will be made only through, records maintained by DTC and its
participants and will be exchangeable for debt securities in certificated form with the same terms in authorized denominations only if:
• DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository;
• DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law and a successor depository is not appointed by us within 90 days; or
• We instruct the trustee that the global security is exchangeable for debt securities in certificated form.
Defeasance
The Indenture permits us to dischar ge or defease certain of our obligations on any series of debt securities issued under the Indenture at any time. We may defease
such obligatio ns relating to a series of debt securities by depositing with the trustee sufficient cash or gover nment securities to pay all sums due on that series of debt securities.
Liens on Assets
The Notes and other debt securities will not be secured. However , if at any time we mortgage, pledge or subject to any lien any of our property or assets, the
Indenture requires us to secure the Notes and other debt securities issued under the Indenture equally and ratably with the debt or obligations secured by such mortgage, pledge
or lien for as long as such debt or obligations remain secured. Exceptions to this requirement include the following:
• purchase-money mortgages or liens;
• liens on any property or asset that existed at the time when we acquired that property or asset;
• any deposit or pledge to secure public or statutory obligations;
• any deposit or pledge with any governmental agency required to qualify us to conduct any part of our business, to entitle us to maintain self-insurance or to
obtain the benefits of any law relating to workmen’ s compensation, unemployment insurance, old age pensions or other social security; or
• any deposit or pledge with any court, board, commission or governmental agency as security for the proper conduct of any proceeding before it.
The Indenture does not prevent any of our affiliates from mortgaging, pledging or subjecting to any lien, any property or asset, even if the affiliate acquired that
property or asset from us.
We may issue or assume an unlimited amount of debt under the Indenture.
Changes to the Indentur e
The Indenture may be changed with the consent of holders owning more than 50% of the principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected
by the change. However , we may not change principal or interest payment terms of the Notes or the percen tage required to change other terms of the Indenture without consent
of the holders of the Notes and the consent of others similarly af fected.
We may enter into supplem ental indentures for other specified purposes, including the creation of any new series of debt securities, without the consent of any holder
of debt securities issued under the Indenture.
Consolidation, Merger or Sale
The Indenture provides that we may not mer ge with another company or sell, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our property to another company unless:
• the successor corporation expressly assumes:
• payment of principal, interest and any premium on the debt securities issued under the Indenture; and
• performance and observance of all covenants and conditions in the Indenture;
• after giving ef fect to the transaction, there is no default under the Indenture;
• we have delivered to the trustee an officers’ certificate and opinion of counsel stating that such transaction complies with the conditions set forth in the
Indenture; and
• if as a result of the transaction, our property would become subject to a lien that would not be permitted by the asset lien restriction, we secure the debt
securities Issued under the Indenture equally and ratably with, or prior to, all indebtedness secured by that lien.
Events of Default
An event of default means, for any series of debt securities issued under the Indenture, any of the following:
• failure to pay interest on that series of debt securities for 90 days after payment is due;
• failure to pay principal or any premium on that series of debt securities when due;
• failure to perform any other covenant relating to that series of debt securities for 90 days after notice to us;
• certain events of bankruptcy , insolvency and reor ganization; and
• any other event of default provided for in the supplement to the Indenture, board resolution or officers’ certificate designating the specific terms of such
series of debt securities.
An event of default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily impact any other series of debt securities issued under the Indenture.
If an event of default for any series of debt securities occurs and continues, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the outstanding principal amount of the debt
securities of such series may declare the entire principal of all the debt securities of that series to be due and payable immediately . If this happens, subject to certain conditions,
the holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the debt securities of that series can rescind the declaration if there has been deposited with the trustee a sum
sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest, principal and any premium.
The holders of more than 50% of the outstanding principal amount of any series of the debt securities, may , on behalf of the holders of all of the debt securities of
that series, control any proceedings resulting from an event of default or waive any past default except a default in the payment of principal, interest or any premium. W e are
required to file an annual certificate with the trustee stating whether we are in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants under the Indenture.
Concerning the T rustee
Within 90 days after a default occurs with respect to a particular series of Notes, the trustee must notify the holders of such series of Notes of all defaults known to
the trustee if we have not remedied them (default is defined to mean any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an event of default with respect
to such series of Notes as specified above under “-Events of Default”). If a default described in the third bullet point under “-Events of Default” occurs, the trustee will not give
notice to the holders of the series until at
least 60 days after the occurrence of that default. The trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the Notes of any default (except in the payment of principal, interest or any
premium) if it in good faith believes that withholding this notice is in the interest of the holders.
Prior to an event of default, the trustee is required to perform only the specific duties stated in the Indenture, and after an event of default, must exercise the same
degree of care as a prudent individual would exercise in the conduct of his or her own af fairs. The trustee is not required to take any action permitted by the Indenture at the
request of holders of the debt securities, unless those holders protect the trustee against costs, expenses and liabilities. The trustee is not required to spend its own funds or
become financially liable when performing its duties if it reasonably believes that it will not be adequately protected financially .
U.S. Bank National Association, the trustee for the Notes, and its af filiates have commercial banking relationships with us and some of our af filiates and serves as
trustee or paying agent under indentures relating to debt securities issued by us and some of our af filiates.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Verizon Comm unications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’ s leading providers of communications,
information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video
services and solutions on our networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility , reliable network connectivity , security and control.  We have a highly diverse
workforce of approximately  135,000  employees as of December 31, 2019 .
To compete effectively in today’ s dynamic marketplace, we are focused on the capabilities of our high-performing networks to drive growth based on delivering what
customers want and need in the new digital world. During 2019 , we focused on leveraging our network leadership; retaining and growing our high-quality customer base while
balancing profitability; enhancing ecosystems in growth businesses; and driving monetization of our networks and solutions. We are creating business value by earning
customers', employees' and shareholders' trust, limiting our environmental impact and continuing our customer growth while creating social benefit through our products and
services. Our strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in
our networks, invest in the fiber that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology
systems and data system capabilities. We believe that steady and consistent investments in our networks and platforms will drive innovative products and services and fuel our
growth.
We are consistently deploy ing new network architectu re and technologies to extend our leadership in both fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks.
We expect that our next-generation multi-use platform, which we call the Intelligent Edge Network, will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, improve
4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) wireless coverage, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market. Our network
leadership is the hallmark of our brand and the foundation for the connectivity , platform and solutions upon which we build our competitive advantage.
Highlights of Our 2019 Financial Results
(dollars in millions)

Business Overview
In November 2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business.  Under the new structure, effective April 1, 2019, there are two reportable segments that we
operate and manage as strategic business units  - Verizon Consumer Group ( Consumer ) and Verizon Business Group ( Business ).
Revenue by Segment
———
Note: Excludes eliminations.
Verizon Consumer Gr oup
Our Consume r segment provides consumer -focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most
extensive wireless networks in the United States  (U.S.) under the Verizon brand and through wholesale and other arrangements. Our wireline services are provided in nine
states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic  network under the Fios brand and over a traditional copper -based
network to customers who are not served by Fios.  Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers
that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis.
Customers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis.  A retail postpaid connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a
customer is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to
Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance.  The Consumer segment also offers
several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled Internet devices, such as tablets, laptop
computers and netbooks, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches and other wearables .
In addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, Consumer sells residential fixed conn ectivity solutions, including Internet, video and voice services, and
wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis.  The Consumer segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019  totaled $91.1 billion , an increase
of $1.3 billion, or 1.4%,  compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 . As of December 31, 2019 , Consumer had approximately 95 million  wireless retail connections, 6
million  broadband connections and 4 million  Fios video connections.
Verizon Business Gr oup
Our Business  segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed
network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various  Internet of Things  (IoT)  servic es and products, including solutions that suppo rt
fleet tracking management , compliance management, field service management, asset tracking and other types of mobile resource management. We provide these products and
services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world. The Business
segment's operating revenu es for the year ended December 31, 2019  totaled $31.4 billion , a decrease of  $91 million, or 0.3%,  compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 .
As of December 31, 2019 , Business had approximately 25 million  wireless retail postpaid connections and 489 thousand  broadband connections.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other includes the results of our media  business, Verizon Media, and other businesses, inves tments in unconsolidated businesses, insurance captives, unallocated
corporate expenses, certain pension and other emplo yee benefit related costs and interest and financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of
divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due to their nature. Although such transactions are
excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from transactions that are not individually significant are
included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment performance.
Verizon Media includes diverse media and technology brands that serve both consumers and businesses. Verizon Media provides consumers with owned and operated and
third-party search propertie s as well as mail, news, finance, sports and entertainment offerings, and provides other businesses and partners access to consumers through digital
advertising, content delivery and video streaming platforms.  Verizon Media's total operating revenues were $7.5 billion  for the year ended December 31, 2019 . This was a
decrease of 3.0%  from the year ended December 31, 2018 .
Capital Expenditur es and Investments
We continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to positi on ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future. During the
year ended December 31, 2019 , these investments included $17.9 billion  for capital expenditures. See "Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities" and "Operating Environment
and Trends" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient,
reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy .
Global Network and Technology
We are focusing our capita l spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE network, while also building our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our
network by utilizing smal l cell technology , in-build ing solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing
mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks.  Over the past several years, we have been leading the
development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. We believe 5G technology will be able to provide
users with eight capabilities, or currencies. The eight currencies are peak data rates, mobile data volumes, mobility , number of connected devices, energy efficiency of
connected devices, service deployment, reduced latency and improved reliability . We expect that 5G technology will provide higher throughput and lower latency than the
current 4G LTE technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of Internet-con nected devices grows. During 2018, we commercially launched 5G
Home on proprietary standards in four U.S. markets  and on global standards in a fifth U.S. market in 2019. We also launched our 5G Ultra Wideband Network in 31 U.S.
markets in 2019, as well as several 5G-compatible smartphones.
To compensa te for the shrinking market for traditional copper -based products, we continue to build our wireline business around fiber-based networks supporting data, video
and advanced  business services - areas where deman d for reliable high-speed connections is growing. We are evolving the archit ecture of our networks to a next-generation
multi-use platform, providing improved ef ficiency and virtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support both our fiber -based
and radio access network technologies. We call this the Intelligent Edge Network. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network
elements, improve our  4G LTE wireless coverage, speed the deployment of  5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market.
Recent Developments
In 2019, the Federal Comm unications Commission (FCC) completed two millimeter wave spectrum license auctions. Verizon participated in these auctions and was the high
bidder on 9 and 1,066 licenses, respectively , in the 24 Gigahertz (GHz) and 28 GHz bands. We submitted an application to the FCC and paid cash of approximately $521
million for the licenses. W e received the licenses during the fourth quarter of 2019.
In December 2019, the FCC  incentive auction for spectrum licenses in the upper  37 GHz,  39 GHz, and  47 GHz bands commenced. As an incumbent licensee, Verizon received
vouchers related to our existing  39 GHz licenses. These vouchers can be converted into cash, the amount of which will not be known until the conclusion of the auction, or
applied towar d the purchase price of spectrum in the auction. At the conclusion of the auction, all existing licenses will be cancelled and new reconfigured licenses or cash will
be distributed depending on the results of the auction. Due to the FCC's rules restricting communications regarding the auction, we will not disclose our financial plans for the
auction durin g the quiet period for this auction unless legally required. In addition, as of this time, until the completion of the auction process, we cannot determine the
resulting financial outcome, including a potential gain or loss. Such gain or loss, if any , may be material.  
Consolidated Results of Operations
In this section, we discuss  our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not includ ed in our segment results. In "Segment Results of Operations," we
review the performance of our two reportable segments in more detail. A detailed discussion of 2017  items and year -over -year comparisons between 2018  and 2017  that are not
included in this Form 10-K  can be found in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for the year ended December 31,
2018 filed with our most recent financial statements and included in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated August 8, 2019.

Consolidated revenues increased $1.0 billion, or 0.8%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily due to an incre ase in revenues at our Consumer segment, partially offset by
decreases in revenues at our Business segment and Corporate and other .
Revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations."
Corporate and other revenues decreased $124 million, or 1.2%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily due to a decrease of $232 million  in revenues within V erizon Media.

Consolidated Operating Expenses $ 101,490  $ 108,585  $ (7,095 ) (6.5)
Operating expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations."
Cost of Services
Cost of services includes the following costs directly  attributable to a service: salaries and wages, benefits, materials and supplies, content costs, contracted services, network
access and transport costs, customer provisioning costs, computer systems support, and costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical facilities. Aggregate customer
care costs, which include billing and service provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative expense.
Cost of services decreased $413 million, or 1.3%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily due to decreases in network access costs, a product realignment char ge in 2018 (see
"Special Items"), decreases in employee-related costs  resulting from the Voluntary Separation Program and decreases in digital content costs. These decreases were partially
offset by increases in rent expense as a result of addin g capacity to the networks to support demand and the adoption of the new lease accounting standard in 2019, regulatory
fees, and costs related to the device protection package of fered to our wireless retail postpaid customers.
Cost of W ireless Equipment
Cost of wireless equipment decreased $369 million, or 1.6%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily as a result of declines in the number of wireless devices sold as a result
of an elongation of the handset upgrade cycle, partially of fset by a shift to higher priced devices in the mix of wireless devices sold.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, gener al and administrative expense includes salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributable to a service or product, bad debt charges, taxes other than income
taxes, advertising and sales commission costs, call center and information technology costs, regulatory fees, professional service fees, and rent and utilities for administrative
space. Also included is a portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed above in "Cost of Services."
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $1.2 billion, or 3.8%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily due to decrease s in employee-related costs  primarily due
to the Volunt ary Separatio n Program, a decrease in severance, pension and benefits charges (see "Special Items"), the acquisition and integration related charges in 2018
primarily related to the acquisition of Yahoo's operati ng business (see "Special Items") and a net gain from dispositions of assets and businesses in 2019 (see "Special Items"),
partially offset by increases in advertising expenses, sales commission and bad debt expense. The increas e in sales commission expense during 2019  compared to 2018 , was
primarily due to a lower net deferral of commission costs as a result of the adoption of T opic 606 on January 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach.
 
Depr eciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $721 million, or 4.1%,  during 2019  compared to 2018, primarily due to the change in the mix of net depreciable assets.
Media Goodwill Impairment
The goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2019 and 2018 for Verizon Media were a result of the Company's annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter (see
"Critical Accounting Estimates").

The change in Other income (expense), net during  the year ended December 31, 2019 , comp ared to the similar period in 2018 , was primari ly driven by early debt redemption
costs of $3.6 billion  recorded during 2019, compared to $725 million  recorded during 2018 (see "Special Items") as well as pension and benefit charges of $126 million
recorded in 2019, compared with pension and benefit credits of $2.1 billion  recorded in 2018 (see "Special Items").

Average debt outstanding $ 112,901  $ 115,858     
Effective interest rate 4.8% 4.8%    
Total interest costs on debt balances decreased  during 2019  primarily due to lower average debt balances.

     Increase/(Decr ease)  
Years Ended December 31, 2019  2018  2019 vs. 2018
Provision for income taxes $ 2,945  $ 3,584  $ (639) (17.8 )%
Effective income tax rate 13.0% 18.3%    
The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income befor e income taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2019  was 13.0%
compared to 18.3%  for 2018 . The decrease  in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the recognitio n of approximately $2.2
billion  of a non-recurring tax bene fit in connection with the disposition of preferred stock, representing a minori ty interest in a foreign affiliate in 2019 compared to the non-
recurring deferred tax benefit of approximately  $2.1 billion as a result of an internal reorganization of legal entiti es within the historical Wireless business, which was offset by
a goodwill char ge that is not deductible for tax purposes in 2018.
A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the ef fective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 12  to the consolidated financial statements.
Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA
Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (Consolidated EBITDA) and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which are presented below ,
are non-gene rally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in
evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and
acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon’ s competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding
back interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization expenses to net income.
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses of unconsolidated
businesses and other incom e and expense, net, as well as the effect of special items. We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our
financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’ s evaluation of business
performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a company’ s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing
impacts caused by differen ces in capital structure, taxes and depreciation policies. Further , the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to
prior period performance and trend analysis. See "Special Items" for additional information.
It is management’ s intent to provide non-GAAP finan cial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon’ s GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by
the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAA P. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the
corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that non-GAAP measures provide relevant and
useful information, which is used by management, investors and other users of our financial information , as well as by our management in assessing both consolidated and
segment perfo rmance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to
that of other companies.

Segment Results of Operations
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units , Consumer and Business. We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on
segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent with the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment performance.
To aid in the understanding of segment performance as it relates to segment operating income, we use the following operating statistics to evaluate the overall effectiveness of
our segments:
Wireless retail connections  are retail customer device postpaid and prepaid conn ections. Retail connections under an account may include those from smartphones and basic
phones (collectively , phones) as well as tablets and other Internet devices, including wearables and retail IoT devices.
Wireless r etail postpaid connections are retail  postpaid customer device connections. Retail connections under an account may include those from phones, as well as tablets and
other Internet devices, including wearables and retail IoT devices.
Fios Internet connections are the total number of connections to the Internet using Fios Internet services.
Fios video connections  are the total number of connections to traditional linear video programming using Fios video services.
Broadband connections  are the  total number of connections to the Internet using Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and Fios Internet services.
Voice connections  are the total number of traditional switched access lines in service and Fios digital voice connections.
Wireless retail connections, net additions are the total number of additional retail customer device postpaid and prepaid connections, less the number of device disconnects
within the current period.
Wireless retail postpaid connections, net additions are the total number of additional retail customer device postpaid connections, less the number of device disconnects within
the current period.
Churn is the rate at which service to either retail or postpaid retail connections is terminated on a monthly basis.
Wireless retail postpaid ARPA is the calculated average service revenue per accoun t (ARP A) from retail postpaid accounts, which does not include recurring device payment
plan billings related to the V erizon device payment program, plan billings related to total mobile protection packages or regulatory fees.
Wireless retail postpaid accounts are retail customers that are directly served and managed under the Verizon brand and use its services. Accounts include unlimited plans,
shared data plans and corporate accounts, as well as legacy single connection plans and family plans. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of
connected devices.
Wireless retail postpaid connections per account  is calculated by dividing the total number of retail postpaid connections by the number of retail postpaid accounts as of the
end of the period.
Segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Segment EBITDA), which is presented below , is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an
alternative to operating income as a measure of opera ting performance. We believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information
in evaluating operating profitability on a more varia ble cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and
acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back
depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating
revenues. Y ou can find additional information about our segments in Note 13  to the consolidated financial statements.
Verizon Consumer Group
Our Consume r segment provides consumer -focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most
extensive wireless networks in the United States under the Verizon brand and through wholesale and other arrangements. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in
the Mid-Atlantic and North eastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network under the Fios brand and over a traditional copper -based network to
customers who are not served by Fios.

(1) As of end of period
(2) Excluding acquisitions and adjustments
Consumer's total operating revenues increased $1.3 billion, or 1.4%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily as a result of increases in Service and Other revenues, partially
offset by a decrease in W ireless equipment revenue.
Service Revenue
Service revenue  increased $1.2 billion, or 1.8%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily due to increases in wireless service and Fios revenues, partially offset by decreases
in wireline voice and DSL services.
Wireless service revenue increased  $1.3 billion , or 2.5% , during 2019  compared to 2018 , due to increases in wireless access revenue, driven by customers shifting to higher
access plans including unlimited plans and increases  in the number of devices per account, the declining  fixed-term subsidized plan base and growth from reseller accounts.
Wireless retail postpaid ARP A increased 2.3% .
For the year ended December 31, 2019 , Fios revenues totaled $10.4 billion and increased $92 million, or 0.9%, compared to 2018 . This increase  was due to a 2.5%  increase  in
Fios Internet connections, reflecting increased deman d in higher broadband speeds, partially offset by a 5.1%  decrease  in Fios video connections, reflecting the ongoing shift
from traditional linear video to over -the-top (OTT) of ferings.
Service reven ue attributabl e to wireline voice and DSL broadband services declined during 2019 , compared to 2018 . The declines are primaril y due to a decrease of 9.1%  in
voice connections resulting primarily from competition and technology substitution with wireless and competing Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and cable telephony
services.
Wireless Equipment Revenue
Wireless equipment revenu e decreased $827 million, or 4.4%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , as a result of declines in wireless device sales prima rily due to an elongation of
the handset upgrade cycle and increased promotions. These decreases were partially of fset by a shift to higher priced units in the mix of wireless devices sold.
Other Revenue
Other revenue includes non-service revenues such as regulatory fees, cost recovery surchar ges, revenues associated with our device protection package, leasing and interest on
equipment financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent.
Other revenue increased $1.0 billion, or 14.4%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily due to pricing increases related to our wireless device protection plans, as well as
regulatory fees.

Cost of Services
Cost of servic es increased $549 million, or 3.6%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily due to increase s in rent expense as a result of adding capacity to the networks to
support demand as well as an increase due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard in 2019, increases in costs related to the device protection package offered to
our wireless retail postpaid  customers, as well as regulatory fees. These increases were partially offset by decreases in employee-related costs primarily due to the Voluntary
Separation Program, as well as decreases in access costs and roaming.
Cost of W ireless Equipment
Cost of wireless equipment decreased $544 million, or 2.9%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily as a result of declines in the number of wireless devices sold as a result
of an elongation of the handset upgrade cycle. These decrease were partially of fset by a shift to higher priced devices in the mix of wireless devices sold.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, gener al and administrative expense increased $938 million, or 6.0%,  during 2019  compa red to 2018 , primarily due to increase s in sales commission and bad debt
expense, and an increase in advertising costs. The increase in sales commission expense during 2019  compared to 2018  was primarily due to a lower net deferral of
commission costs as a result of the adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospec tive approach. These increases were partially offset by decreases in
employee-related costs primarily due to the V oluntary Separation Program.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $599 million, or 5.0%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , driven by the change in the mix of total Verizon depreciable assets
and Consumer's usage of those assets.

Business revenues decreased $91 million, or 0.3%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily due to decreases in Global Enterprise and Wholesale revenues, partially offset by
increases in Small and Medium Business and Public Sector and Other revenues.
Global Enterprise
Global Enterprise of fers services to lar ge businesses, which are identified based on their size and volume of business with V erizon, as well as non-U.S. public sector customers.
Global Enterprise revenues decreased $383 million, or 3.4%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily due to declines in traditional data and voice communication services as
a result of competitive price pressures. These revenue decreases were partially of fset by increases in wireless service revenue.
Small and Medium Business
Small and Medium Busine ss offers wireless services and equipment, tailored voice and networking produ cts, Fios services, IP networking, advanced voice solutions, security
and managed information technology  services to our U.S.-based customers that do not meet the requirements to be categorized as Global Enterprise.
Small and Medium Busine ss revenues increased $712 million, or 6.6%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily due to an increase in wireless postpaid service revenue of
11.7% as a result of increases in the amount of wireless retail postpaid connections. These increases were further driven by increased wireless equipment revenue resulting
from a shift to higher priced units in the mix of wireless devices sold and increases in
the number of wireless devices sold, increased revenu e related to our wireless device protection package, as well as increased revenue related to Fios services. These revenue
increases were partially of fset by revenue declines related to the loss of voice and DSL service connections.
Small and Medium Business Fios revenues totaled $915 million and increased $110 million, or 13.7%, during 2019  compared to 2018 , reflec ting the increase in total
connections, as well as increased demand for higher broadband speeds.
Public Sector and Other
Public Sector  and Other offers wireless products and services as well as wireline connectivity and managed solutions to U.S. federal, state and local governments and
educational institutions. These services include the business services and connectivity similar to the products and services offered by Global Enterprise, in each case, with
features and pricing designed to address the needs of governments and educational institutions.
Public Sector  and Other revenues increased $89 million, or 1.5%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , driven by increases in networking and wireless postpaid service revenue as a
result of an increase in wireless retail postpaid connections.
Wholesale
Wholesale offers wireline communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance, and wireless carriers that use
our facilities to provide services to their customers.
Wholesale revenues decreased $509 million, or 13.6%,  during 2019  compared to 2018 , primarily due to declines in core data and traditional voice services resulting from the
effect of technology substitution and continuing contraction of market rates due to competition.

Severance, Pension and Benefits Charges (Credits)
During 2019 , in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur , we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits
charges of $126 million  in our pension and postreti rement benefit plans. The charges were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our conso lidated statem ents of income
and were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from
a weighted-average of 4.4%  at December 31, 2018 to a weighted-average of 3.3%  at December 31, 2019 ($4.3 billion ), partially offset by the difference between our estimated
return on assets and our actual return on assets ($2.3 billion ) and other assumption adjustments of $1.9 billion , of which $1.6 billion  related to healthcare claims experience.
During 2019, we also recorded net pre-tax severance char ges of  $204 million  in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
During 2018,  we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $2.1 billion  in accordanc e with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period
in whic h they occur . The pension and benefits remeasurement credits of $2.3 billion , which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of
income, were primarily driven by an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans
from a weighted-average of 3.7%  at December 31, 2017 to a weighted-average of 4.4%  at December 31, 2018 ( $2.6 billion ), and mortality and other assumption adjustments of
$1.7 billion , $1.6 billion  of which related to health care claims and trend adjustments, offset by the difference between our estima ted return on assets of 7.0%  and our actual
return on assets of (2.7)%  ($1.9 billion ). The credits were partiall y offset by $177 million  due to the effects of participants retiring under the Voluntary Separation Program.
During 2018, we also recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $2.2 billion  in Selling, general and administrative expense, prim arily driven by the Voluntary Separation
Program for select U.S.-ba sed management employees and other headcount reduction initiatives, which resulted in a severance charge of $1.8 billion  ($1.4 billion  after-tax),
and $339 million  in severance costs recorded under other existing separation plans.
Due to the presentation of the other components of net periodic benefit cost, we recognize a portion of the pension and benefits char ges (credits) in Other income (expense), net
in our consolidated statements of income.
See Note 1 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to severance, pension and benefits char ges (credits).
Acquisition and Integration Related Charges
Acquisition and integratio n related charges of $553 million  recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to the acquisition of Yahoo’ s operating
business in June 2017.
Product Realignment Charges
Product realignment charges of $658 million  recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to the discontinuation of the go90 platform and associated
content during the second quarter of 2018.
Impairment Charges
The impairment charges consist of write-downs of goodwill and other investments or assets. The goodwill impairment charges of $186 million  and $4.6 billion  recorded during
the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively , for Verizon Media were a result of the Com pany's annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter (see
"Critical Accounting Estimates"). In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of $50 million  in Equity in losses of unconsolidated businesses  related  to a media joint
venture investment.
Early Debt Redemption Costs
During 2019 and 2018, we recorded early debt redemptions costs of $3.6 billion  and $725 million , respectively .
 
We recognize early debt redemptions costs in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income. See Note 7  to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information related to our early debt redemptions.
Net Gain from Dispositions of Assets and Businesses
During 2019 , we recorded a pre-tax net gain from dispositions of assets and businesses of $261 million  in connection with the sale of various real estate properties and
businesses.
Operating Environment and Trends
The telecommunications industry is highly competiti ve. We expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased market share.
Our high-quality customer base and networks differentiate us from our competitors and give us the ability to plan and manage through changing economic and competitive
conditions. We remain focused on executing on the fundamentals of the business: maintaining a high-quality customer base, delivering strong financial and operating results
and strengthening our balance sheet. We will continue to invest for growth, which we believe is the key to creating value for our shareholders. We continue to lead in 4G LTE
performance while building momentum for our 5G network. Our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments in our Intelligent Edge Network that enable
efficiencies throughout our core infrastructure and deliver flexibility to meet customer requirements.
The U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth for the industry . We expect future
revenue growth in the industry to be driven by expanding existing customer relationships, increasing the number of ways customers can connect with wireless networks and
services and increasing the penetration of other connected devices including wearables, tablets and IoT devices. We expect 5G technology will provide a significant
opportunity for growth in the industry in 2021 and beyond. With respect to our wireles s connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireles s service
providers, including AT&T  Inc., Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile USA, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with
resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their customers. Resellers may include cable companies.  We face
competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of
wireless products and services, in addition to non-tra ditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and others are offering
alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireles s provider ’s voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing
video content.
With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape.  We compete in this area by offering our customers
services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price. As the deman d for wireless services continues to grow , wireless service providers
are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices.  These service offerings will vary from time to time based on customer needs, technology changes and market
conditions and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional of fers.
We expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customer s shift to higher access plans, as well as from increased connections
per account. Future service  revenue growth opportuni ties will be dependent on expanding the penetration of our services, increasing the number of ways that our customers can
connect with our networks and services and the development of new ecosystems. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device
payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and some providers of fer device leasing arrangements.
Current and potential competitors in the wireline service market include cable companies, wireless service providers, domest ic and foreign telecommunications providers,
satellite television companies, Internet service providers,  over -the-top  providers and other companies that of fer network services and managed enterprise solutions.
In addition, companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our wireline services. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated
service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers
for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises. Many of these companies have  strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer
relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may af fect our future revenue growth.
Despite this challenging environment, we expect that we will be able to grow key aspects of our wireline services. We continue to provide network reliability and offer
products, which include fiber-optic Internet access, several video services, and voice services. Further , we will continue to offer our business and government customers more
robust IP products and services, and advance our IoT strategies by leveraging business models that monetize usage on our networks at the connectivity , platform and solution
layers.
The online advertising market continues to evolve as online users are migrating from traditional desktop to mobile and multiple-device usage. Also, there is a continued shift
towards programmatic advertising which presents opportunities to connect online advertisers with the appropriate online users in a rapid environment. Our Media business
competes with other online search engines, advertising platforms, digital video services and social networ ks. We are experiencing pressure from search and desktop usage and
believe the pressure in these sectors will continue. We are implementing initiatives to realize syner gies across all of our media assets and build services around our core content
pillars to diversify revenue and return to growth.
We will also continue to focus on cost efficiencies to ensure we have the maximum flexibility to adjust to changes in the competitive and economic environments and
maximize returns to shareholders.
2020 Connection Trends
In our Consumer segment, we expect to continue to attract new customers and maintain high-quality retail postpaid customers, capitalizing on demand for data services and
providing our customers new ways of using wireless services in their daily lives. We expect that future connection growth will be driven by smartphones, tablets and other
connected devices such as wearables. We believe the combination of our wireless network performanc e and Mix & Match unlimited plans provides a superior customer
experience, supporting increased penetration of data services and the continued attraction and retention of higher valued retail postpaid connections. We expect to manage
churn by providing a consi stent, reliable experience on our wireless service and focusing on improving the customer experience through simplified pricing and continued focus
in our distribution channels. We expect to continue to grow our Fios Internet connections as we seek to increase our penetration rates within our Fios service areas, further
supported by the demand for higher speed internet connections. In Fios video, the business continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear television
market. We expect to mana ge market pressure by offering customers a choice of video service, including options such as Mix & Match on Fios and other offerings. We have
experienced continuing access line and DSL losses as customers have disconnected both primary and secon dary lines and switched to alternative technologies such as wireless,
VoIP and cable for voice and data services.
In our Business segment, we offer wireless products  and services to business and government customer s across the U.S. We continue to grow our retail connections while
facing a competitive environment. W e expect to maintain connection growth in part by adding capacity and density
to our 4G LTE network, in addition to leading the build-out of 5G technology . We expect this connectio n growth, combined with our industry-leading network assets, will
provide additi onal opportunities to sell solutions, such as those around security , advanced communications and professional services. We expect to expand our existing services
offered to business customers through our Intelligent Edge Network, our multi-use platform.
2020 Operating Revenue Trends
In our Consumer segment, we expect to see a continuation of the service revenue trends from 2019 as customers shift to higher access plans with additional services and
increase the number of devices they connect with our networks and services. Equipment revenues are largely dependent on wireless device sales volumes, the mix of devices,
promotions and upgrades, which are subject to devic e lifecycles, iconic device launches and competition within the wireless industry . We anticipate an increase in wireless
device upgrades in the second half of the year as we expand the availability and reach of our 5G network.
In our Busine ss segment, we expect overall revenue  growth in 2020 as wireless services and our high-q uality fiber-based products will offset secular declines from legacy
technologies and pressure from competition. We expect wireless revenue to expand, driven by connectio n growth led by Small and Medium Business. We expect our Fios
products, through increased penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth. Legacy traditional wireline services continue to face secular pressures.
Our Media Business, Verizon Media, is primarily made up of digital advertising products. We are experiencing revenue pressure from search and desktop usage, which started
to improve throughout 2019 and believe the pressur e in those sectors will continue. We are focused on returning to revenue growth by implementing initiatives to realize
syner gies across all of our media assets and building services around our core content pillars. W e expect positive growth in mobile services and products.
2020 Operating Expense and Cash Flow from Operations Trends
We expect our consolidated operating income margin and adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin to remain strong as we continue to undertake initiatives to reduce our overall
cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the business in 2020  and beyond. Business Excellence initiatives include the
adoption of the zero-based  budgeting methodology , driving capital efficiencies from the architecture of the networks, evolving our Information Technology strategy and the
continuing benefit from the Voluntary Separation Program. We believe our additional investments in our Business segment in both product simplification and continued focus
on process improvements and new work tools will drive cost savings and create incremental growth opportunities in areas such as 5G and One Fiber . The goal of the Business
Excellence initiative is to take $10 billion of cumulative cash outflows out of the business over four years , beginning with 2018. As part of this initiative, we are focusing on
both operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our Business Excellence initiatives produced cumulative cash savings of $5.7 billion through the end of 2019 from a mix of
capital and operational expenditure activities. The program remains on track to achieve our goal. Expenses related to programs funded through the reinvestment of program
savings are expected to apply of fsetting pressures to our mar gins.
The implementation of Topic 606 resulted in the deferral of commission expense in both our Consumer and Business segments. In 2020, we expect a smaller year-over -year
benefit from the adoption of the standard due to the deferral of commission costs as compared to 2018 and 2019. The reduction in benefit creates a year-over -year headwind to
operating income.
We create value for our shareholders by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions that support continued profitable growth, thereby
increasing customer satisfaction and usage of our products and services. In addition, we have used our cash flows to maintain and grow our dividend payout to shareholders.
Verizon’ s Board of Directors increased the Company’ s quarterly dividend by 2.1%  during  2019, making this the thirteenth consecutive  year in which we have raised our
dividend.
Our goal is to use our cash to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to look for investment opportunities that will help us to grow the business,
strengthen our balance sheet, acquire spectrum licenses (see "Cash Flows from Investing Activities"), pay dividends to our shareholders and, when appropriate, buy back
shares of our outstanding common stock (see "Cash Flows from Financing Activities").
Capital Expenditures
Our 2020  capita l progr am includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding our core networks, adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE
network in order to stay ahead of our customers’ increasing data demands and deploying our 5G network , transforming our structure to deploy the Intelligent Edge Network
while reducing the cost to deliver services to our customers, and pursuing other opportunities to drive operating efficiencies. We expect that the new network architecture will
simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, improve our 4G L TE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G technology , and create new enterprise opportunities in
the business market. The level and the timing of the Company’ s capital expenditures within these broad categories can vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors
outside of our control, such as material weather events, equipment availability from vendors and permits from local governments. Capital expenditures for 2020  are expected to
be in the range of $17.0 billion to $18.0 billion, including the continued investment in our 5G network. Capital expenditures were $17.9 billion  in 2019  and $16.7 billion  in
2018 . We believe that we have significant discretion over the amount and timing of our capital expenditures on a Company-wide basis as we are not subject to any agreement
that would require significant capital expenditures on a designated schedule or upon the occurrence of designated events.

Increase in cash, cash equivalents and r estricted cash $ 1 $ 1,028
We use the net cash generated from our operations to fund expansion and modernization of our networks , service and repay external financing, pay dividends, invest in new
businesses and spectrum and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent
necessary , from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements. We expect that our capital spending requirements will
continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities or to
maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility . Our cash and cash equivalent s are held both domestically and internationally , and are invested to
maintain principal and provide liquidity . See "Market Risk" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.
Our available external financing arrangements include an active commercial paper program, credit available under credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, vendor
financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other capital market securities that are privately-placed or offered
overseas. In addition, we monetize our device payment plan agreement receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.
Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities
Our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.4 billion  during 2019 , compared to the
similar period in 2018, primarily due to an increas e in earnings and a decrease in discretionary contributions to qualified employe e benefit plans, offset by changes in working
capital, which  includes an increase in cash income taxes as well as severance payments as a result of the Voluntary Separation Program. We made $300 million and $1.7 billion
in discretiona ry employee benefits contributions to our defined benefit pension plan during 2019 and 2018, respectively . As a result of the discretionary pension contributions,
we expect that there will be no required pension funding until 2026, which will continue to benefit future cash flows. These contributions also improved the funded status of
our qualified pension plan.
Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities
Capital Expenditur es
Capital expenditures continue to relate primarily to the use of capital resources to facilitate the intro duction of new products and services, enhance responsiveness to
competitive challenges, maintain our existing infrastructure and increase the operating ef ficiency and productivity of our networks.
Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, were as follows:
(dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31, 2019  2018
Capital expenditures (including capitalized software) $ 17,939  $ 16,658
Total as a percentage of revenue 13.6% 12.7%
Capital expenditures increased  in 2019  primarily due to an increase in investments to support multi-use fiber assets, which support the densification of our 4G LTE network
and our 5G technology deployment. Our investments are primarily related to network infrastructure to support the business.
Acquisitions
During 2019  and 2018 , we invested $898 million  and $1.4 billion , respectively , in acquisitions of wireless licenses. During 2019  and 2018 , we also invested an insignificant
amount and $230 million , respectively , in acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired.
In 2019, the FCC completed two millimeter wave spectrum license auctions. We paid approximately $521 million for spectrum licenses in connection with these auctions. See
Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In January 2018, Verizon acquired NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink) from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO Holdings for approximately $493 million , subject to certain
adjustments, of which $320 million (an option exerci se price to acquire NextLink) was prepaid in the first quarter of 2017. The option exercise price represented the fair value
of the option. The remaining cash consideration was paid at the closing of the transaction. The spectrum acquired as part of the transaction is being used for our 5G technology
deployment.
In February 2018, Verizon  acquired Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path), a holder of millimeter wave spectrum configured for 5G wireless services for total
consideration reflecting an enterprise value of approx imately $3.1 billion, which was primarily settled with Verizon shares but also included transaction costs payable in cash
of approximately $736 million, consisting primarily of a fee paid to the FCC. The spectrum acquired as part of the transaction is being used for our 5G technology deployment.
During 2019  and 2018 , we completed various other acquisitions for an insignificant amount of cash consideration.
See "Acquisitions and Divestitures" for information on our acquisitions.
Dispositions
During 2019, we received gross proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion for a sale-leaseback transaction for buildings and real estate. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.
Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities
We seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility
resulting from changes in market conditions. During 2019  and 2018 , net cash used in financing activities was $18.2 billion  and $15.4 billion , respectively .
2019
During 2019 , our net cash used in financing activities of $18.2 billion  was primarily driven by:
• $23.9 billion  used for repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations, which included $6.3 billion  used for
prepayments and repayments of asset-backed long-term borrowings;
• $10.0 billion  used for dividend payments; and
• $1.8 billion used for net debt related costs.
These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $18.7 billion , which included $8.6 billion  of proceeds from our asset-backed debt
transactions.
Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-T erm Borrowings
At December  31, 2019 , our total debt decreased to $111.5 billion  as compared to $113.1 billion  at December 31, 2018 . During both the years ended December 31, 2019  and
2018 , our ef fective interest rate was 4.8% . The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consists of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest rates do not have
a material ef fect on our interest payments. See also "Market Risk" and Note 7  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
At December  31, 2019 , approximately $23.5 billion , or 21.1% , of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily
the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on substantially all of our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and
principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.
Verizon may continue to repurchase debt securities issued by Verizon and its affiliates in the future throu gh open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender
offers, exchange of fers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as V erizon may from time to time determine for cash or other consideration.
Other , net
Other , net financing activi ties during 2019  includes early redemption costs, see "Special Items" for additional information, as well as cash paid on debt exchanges and
derivative-related transactions. See Note 15  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Dividends
The Verizon Board of Directors assesses the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis taking into account such factors as long-term growth opportunities, internal
cash requirements and the expectations of our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2019 , the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment by 2.1%  to $0.6150  from
$0.6025  per share from the previous quarter . This is the thirteenth consecutive year that V erizon’ s Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend increase.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2019 , we paid $10.0 billion  in dividends.
2018
During 2018 , our net cash used in financing activities of $15.4 billion  was primarily driven by:
• $14.6 billion  used for repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations, which included $3.6 billion  used for
prepayments of asset-backed long-term borrowings; and
• $9.8 billion  used for dividend payments.
These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $10.8 billion, which included $4.8 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt
transactions.
Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-T erm Borrowings
At December  31, 2018 , our total debt was $113.1 billion , and during the year ended December 31, 2018 , our effective interest rate was 4.8% . The substan tial majority of our
total debt portfolio consiste d of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest rates did not have a material effect on our interest payments. See "Market Risk" and Note
7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
At December  31, 2018 , approximate ly $17.1 billion, or 15.1%, of the aggre gate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily
the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on a majority of our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal
payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.
Other , net
Other , net financing activit ies during 2018 , included early debt redem ption costs. See "Special Items" for additional information, as well as cash paid on debt exchanges and
derivative-related transactions.
Dividends
During the third quarter of 2018 , the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment by 2.1% to $0.6025 per share.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2018 , we paid $9.8 billion in dividends.
Asset-Backed Debt
As of December 31, 2019 , the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $12.4 billion . Our asset-backed debt includes Asset-Backed Notes (ABS Notes) issued to third-party
investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facilities) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively , the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt
bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively , the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in connection
with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, Cellco Partnership  (Cellco) and certain other affiliates of Verizon (collectively , the
Originators) transfer device payment plan agreement receivables to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt.
Verizon entiti es retain the equity interests in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other
related payments and expenses.
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. The device payment plan agreement
receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-backed debt and expenses
related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed
debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’ s creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied.
The Investors or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do not have any recourse to Verizon with
respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, V erizon has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco and
the Originators to the ABS Entities.
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreem ent receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be placed into
segregated accounts. Depo sits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other , and Other assets in our consolidated
balance sheets.
Proceeds from our asset-b acked debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt
issued and the assets securing this debt are included in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In May 2018, we entered into an ABS financing facility with a number of financial institutions (2018 ABS Financing Facility). One loan agreement was entered into in
connection with the 2018 ABS Financing Facility . In May 2019, the $540 million  outstanding under the loan agreement was prepaid, and the loan agreement was terminated.
In September  2016, we entered into an ABS financing facility with a number of financial institutions (2016 ABS Financing Facility). Two loan agreements were entered into in
connection with the 2016 ABS Financing Facility in September 2016 and May 2017. In April and May 2019, we paid off both the 2016 and 2017 loans for an aggregate of
$671 million , and the loan agreements were terminated .
In May 2019, the 2016 ABS Financing Facility was amended and restated (2019 ABS Financing Facility).  One loan agreement was entered into in connection with the 2019
ABS Financing Facility . Under the 2019 loan agreement, we have the right to prepay all or a portion of the advances at any time without penalty , but in certain cases, with
breakage costs. During 2019, we received $4.8 billion of borrowings and prepaid $1.5 billion under the 2019 loan agreement.

(1) The revolvin g credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified  credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has
incurred a material adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit.
(2) During 2019  and 2018 , we drew down $1.5 billion  and $3.0 billion  from these facilities, respectively . We use these credit facilities to finance equipment-related purchases.
Common Stock
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee  and shareholder plans. During the years ended  December 31, 2019
and 2018 , we issued  3.8 million  and 3.5 million  common shares from T reasury stock, respectively , which had an insignificant aggregate value.
In February 2020, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million  shares of the Company's common stock. The program
will terminate  when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches  100 million , or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is
sooner . The program permits Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. There
were no repurchases of common stock during 2019 or 2018 under our previously authorized share buyback program.
Credit Ratings
Verizon’ s credit ratings did not change in 2019  or 2018 .
Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendat ions to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to
revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating or ganization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Covenants
Our credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include requirements to pay interest and principal in a timely
fashion, pay taxes, maintai n insurance with responsib le and reputable insurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial
transactions, maintain our properties, provide financ ial and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and consolidations, and other
similar covenants.
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.
Change In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019  totaled $2.6 billion , a $151 million  decrease  compared to Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 , primarily as a
result of the factors discussed above.
Restricted cash at December 31, 2019  totaled $1.3 billion , a $152 million  increase  compared to restricted cash at December 31, 2018 , primarily due to cash collections on the
device payment plan agreement receivables that are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GA AP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete
understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities. We
believe it is a more conserv ative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it
does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on finance lease obligations
or cash payments for business acquisitions or wirel ess licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated
statements of cash flows.
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to Free cash flow:
 (dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31, 2019  2018
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 35,746  $ 34,339
Less Capital expenditures (including capitalized software) 17,939  16,658
Free cash flow $ 17,807  $ 17,681
The increase in free cash flow during 2019  is a reflection of the increase in operating cash flows, partially of fset by the increase in capital expenditures discussed above.
Employee Benefit Plans Funded Status and Contributions
Employer Contributions
We operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily relate to our domestic business units. During 2019
and 2018 , contributions to our qualified pension plans were $300 million  and $1.0 billion , respectively . We made contributions of $71 million  in 2019  to our nonqualified
pension plans.
The Company’ s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. In an
effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match cash flows
from investments with projected benefit payments. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when liabilities increase (referred to
as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries; however , we also expect the strategy to result in lower
asset returns. Nonqualified pension contributions are estimated to be approximately $70 million  in 2020 .
Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since these other postretirement benefit plans do not
have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $449 million  to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2019  and $1.2 billion, including  $679 million
discretionary contributions, in 2018. Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $700 million  in 2020 .

(1) Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 7  to the consolidated financial statements.
(2) See Note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(3) Items included in purchase  obligations are primarily commitments to purchase content and network services, equipment, software and marketing services, which will be
used or sold in the ordinar y course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the
subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. For this reason, the amounts presented in this table alone do
not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows or changes in our expected cash position. See Note 16 to the consolidated financ ial statements for
additional information.
(4) Other long-te rm liabilities represent estimated postr etirement benefit and qualified pension plan contributions. Estimated qualified pension plan contributions include
expected minimum funding contributions, which commence in 2026  based on the plan's current funded status. Estimated postretirement benefit payments include expected
future postretirement benefit payments. These estimated amounts: (1) are subject to change based on changes to assumptions and future plan performance, which could
impact the timing or amoun ts of these payments; and (2) exclude expectations beyond 5 years due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts. See Note 1 1 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information .
(5) Represents future minimum payments under the sublease arrangement for our tower transaction. See Note 6 to the consolidated finan cial statements for additi onal
information.
We are not able to make a reasonable estimate of when the unrecognized tax benefits balance of $2.9 billion  and related interest and penalties will be settled with the respective
taxing authorities until issues or examinations are further developed. See Note 12  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Guarantees
We guarantee the debentures of our operating telepho ne company subsidiaries as well as the debt obligations of GTE LLC, as successor in interest to GTE Corporation, that
were issued and outstanding prior to July 1, 2003. See Note 7  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In connection  with the execution of agreements for the sale of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers
pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as financial losses. See Note 16  to the consol idated financ ial statements
for additional information.
As of December 31, 2019 , letters of credit totaling approximately $632 million , which  were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing
arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. See Note 16  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Market Risk
We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,
changes in investment, equity and commodity prices  and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of
derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward  starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold
derivatives for trading purposes.
It is our gener al policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives in optimizing
exposure to various marke t risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to
protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would completely
eliminate the ef fect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings.
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support
annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. Negotiations and executions of new ISDA master agreements and CSA agreements with our
counterparties continued during 2018. The CSA agreements contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based
upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. At December 31, 2019 , we held an insignificant amount and at
December 31, 2018 , we posted approximately $0.1 billion  of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded  as Other
current liabilities and Prepa id expenses and other , respectively , in our consolidated balance sheets. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our
counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial
condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties.  See Note 9  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the derivative portfolio.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to change s in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term  debt that carries floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2019 ,
approximately 79% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, inclu ding the effect of interest rate swap agreements
designated as hedges. The impact of a 100-basis-poin t change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, including our
interest rate swap agreeme nts that are designated as hedges, of approximately $248  million. The interest rates  on our existing long-term debt obligations are unaffected by
changes to our credit ratings.
Certain of our floating rate debt and our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are linked to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as the
benchmark rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent U.S. and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to
become unavailable or to perform or be reported differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an
increase in the cost of our floating rate debt or exposure under our interest rate derivative transactions. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position given
our current mix of variable and fixed-rate debt, taking into account the impact of our interest rate hedging.
The table that follows summarizes the fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2019  and 2018 . The
table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming 100-basis-point upward and downward shifts in the yield curve.
Our sensitivity analysis does not include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans, if any, because they are not significantly affected by changes in market
interest rates.

Inter est Rate Swaps
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates that are currently based on
LIBOR, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges  and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of designated
debt issuances.  At December 31, 2019 , the fair value of the asset  and liability of these contracts were $568 million  and $173 million , respectively . At December 31, 2018 , the
fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts were insignificant and $813 million , respectively . At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , the total notional amount of the
interest rate swaps was $17.0 billion  and $19.8 billion , respectively .
Forward Starting Inter est Rate Swaps
We have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our exposure to interest rate changes on future forecasted
transactions.  At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , the fair value of the liability of these contracts was $604 million  and $60 million , respectively . At December 31, 2019  and 2018 ,
the total notional amount of the forward starting interest rate swaps was $3.0 billion  and $4.0 billion , respectively .
Inter est Rate Caps
We also have  interest rate caps which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. We enter into interest rate caps to mitigate
our interest exposure to interest rate increases on our ABS Financing Facility and ABS Notes.  The fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts was insignificant at
both December 31, 2019  and 2018 . At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , the total notional value of these contracts was $679 million  and $2.2 billion , respectively .
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the local currency . The translation of incom e statement and balance sheet amounts of our foreign operations into
U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and
losses on foreign currency  transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of income in Other income (expense), net. At December 31, 2019 , our primary translation
exposure was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollar and Japanese Y en.
Cross Curr ency Swaps
We have entered into cross currency swaps designate d as cash flow hedges to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc and Australian Dollar -denominated cash
flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses.  The fair value of the asset
of these contracts was $211 million  and $220 million  at December 31, 2019  and 2018 , respectively . At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , the fair value of the liability of these
contracts was $912 million  and $536 million , respectively . At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , the total notional amount of the cross currency swap s was $23.1 billion  and $16.6
billion , respectively .
Foreign Exchange Forwards
We also have foreign exchange forwards which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. We enter into British
Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk related to non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of
international subsidiaries.  At December 31, 2019 , the fair value of the asset  of these contracts was insignificant. At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , the total notional amount of
the foreign exchange forwards was $1.1 billion  and $600 million , respectively .
Critical Accounting Estimates and Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Critical Accounting Estimates
A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements is as follows:
Wireless Licenses and Goodwill
Wireless licenses and Good will are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets
and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter , unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or changes in
circumstances during an interim period providing impairment indicators are present. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent appropriate
marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value
calculations used in our impairment tests, these estim ates and assumptions are uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in
the future there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market participant
assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in different fair value estimates. Significant and adverse changes
to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units.
Wireless Licenses
The carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $95.1 billion  as of December 31, 2019 . We aggregate our wireles s licenses into one single unit of accounting, as
we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain
radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit
the useful life of our wireless licenses.
In 2019 , we performed a qualitative impairment assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying
amount. As part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors including the historical business enterprise value of our wireless business, macroeconomic
conditions (including chan ges in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin projections), the recent
and projected financial performance of our wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors.
In 2018, our quantitative impairment test consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test
date.
Our impairment test in 2019 indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licen ses remained above their carrying value and, therefore, did not result
in an impairm ent. Our impairment test in 2018 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses significantly exceeded their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in
an impairment.
Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfie ld approach. The Greenfield approach is an income-based valuation
approach that values the wireless licenses by calculat ing the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the
wireless licen ses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless
licenses as of the valuation date. As a result, we
were required to make significant estimates about future cash flows specifically associated with our wirele ss licenses, an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated
with those estimated cash flows and assumed terminal value and growth rates. We considered curren t and expected future economic conditions, current and expected
availability of wireless network technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating future cash flows. The
discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the
valuation date. We developed the discount rate based on our consideration of the cost of debt and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the valuation date.
Accordingly , our discount rate incorporated our estimate of the expected return a marketplace participa nt would have required as of the valuation date, including the risk
premium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the valuation date. The terminal value growth rate represented our estimate of the marketplace’ s
long-term growth rate.
Goodwill
In November 2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business. The Company began reporting externally under the new structure as of April 1, 2019 which
resulted in certain changes to our operating segments and reporting units. Upon the date of reorganization, the goodwill of our historical Wireless reporting unit, historical
Wireline reporting unit and historical Verizon Connect reporting unit were reallocated to our new Consumer and Business reporting units using a relative fair value approach.
At December 31, 2019, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $24.4 billion , of which $17.1 billion  was in our Consumer reporting unit and $7.3 billion  was in our
Business reporting unit. To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we elect not to conduct the qualita tive assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist, the
determination of whether an impairment has occurred requires the determination of the fair value of each the reporting unit being assessed.
Under the qualitative assessment, we consider severa l qualitative factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the
excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations
(including industry revenue and  EBITDA  margin projections), the recent and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, as well as other factors.
Under our quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market approach and a discounted cash flow method. The market approach includes
the use of comparative multiples to corroborate disco unted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components-projected cash
flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection
period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal
value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the WACC, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. The application
of our goodwill impairmen t test required key assumptions underlying our valuation model. The discounted cash flow analysis factored in assumptions on discount rates and
terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives, as well as revenue and EBITDA growth relative to history and market trends and
expectations. The market multiples approach incorpo rated significant judgment involved in the selection comparable public company multiples and benchmarks. The selection
of companies was influenced by differences in growth and profitability , and volatility in market prices of peer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently uncertain, and
an adverse change in one or a combination of these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future.
A projected sustained decli ne in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and may result in impairment charges. Such a
decline could be driven by , among other things: (1) further anticipated decreases in service pricing, sales volumes and long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures
or other factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in achieving the goals in strategic initiatives. Also, adverse changes to macroeconomic factors, such as increases to
long-term interest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit.
We performe d impairment assessments of the impacted reporting units, specifically our historical Wireless, historical Wireline and historical Connect reporting units on
March 31, 2019, immediate ly before our strategic reorganization became effective. Our impairment assessm ents indicated that the fair value for each of our historical Wireless,
historical Wireline and historical Connect reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values, and therefore did not result in a goodwill impairment. We then performed
quantitative assessments of our Consumer and Busin ess reporting units on April 1, 2019, immediately following our strategic reorganization. Our impairment assessments
indicated that the fair value for each of our Consum er and Business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore, did not result in a goodwill
impairment. Our Media reporting unit was not impacted by the strategic reor ganization and there was no indicator of impairment as of the reor ganization date.
We performed qualitative impairment assessments for our Consumer and Business reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2019. Our qualitative assessments indicated that
it was more likely than not that the fair values for our Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and, therefore, did not result in an
impairment. We performed  quantitative impairment assessments for our Media reporting unit in 2019 and 2018. For details on our Media reporting unit, refer to the discussion
below .
Our Media business, Verizon Media, experienced increased competitive and market pressures throughout 2018 that resulted in lower than expected revenues and earnings.
These pressures were expe cted to continue and have resulted in a loss of market positioning to our comp etitors in the digital advertising business. Our Media business also
achieved lower than expected benefits from the integration of the Y ahoo  Inc. and AOL  Inc. (AOL) businesses.
As of August  2018, Hans Vestber g became Chief Executive Officer of Verizon, and as of October 2018, K. Guru Gowrappan was appointed Chief Executive Officer of our
Media business. In connection with Verizon’ s annual budget process during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, the leadership at both Verizon Media and Verizon completed a
comprehensive five-year strategic planning review of Verizon Media's business prospects resulting in unfavorable adjustments to Verizon Media's financial projections. These
revised projections were used as a key input into V erizon Media's annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018.
During the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, consis tent with our accounting policy , we applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method
reflecting current assumpti ons and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which resulted in the determination that the fair value of
the Media reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately  $186 million  ($176 million  after-
tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a charge of $4.6 billion  ($4.5 billion  after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2018 in our conso lidated statements of income.  The goodwill
balance of the Media reporting unit  has been fully written of f as a result of these impairment char ges.
We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for all of the other reporting units in 2018. Our impairment tests indicated that the fair value for each of our historical
Wireless, historical W ireline and historical Connect reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
Pension and Other Postr etirement Benefit Plans
We maintain benefit plans for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and other postretirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2019 , in the
aggregate, pension plan benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets, which will result in future pension plan expense. Other postretirement benefit plans
have larger benefit obligat ions than plan assets, resulting in expense. Significant benefit plan assumptions, including the discount rate used, the long-term rate of return on
plan assets, the determination of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan income, expense, assets and
obligations. Changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits. A sensitivity analysis of the
impact of changes in these assumptions on the benefi t obligations and expense (income) recorded, as well as on the funded status due to an increase or a decrease in the actual
versus expected return on plan assets as of December 31, 2019  and for the year then ended pertaining to Verizon’ s pension and postretirement benefit plans, is provided in the
table below .

* In determin ing its pension and other postretireme nt obligation, the Company used a weighted-average discount rate of 3.3% . The rate was selected to approximate the
composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2019 . The bonds selected had maturities that coincided with
the time perio ds during which benefits payments are expected to occur , were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $300 million
par outstanding).
The annual measurement date for both our pension  and other postretirement benefits is December 31. We use the full yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost
component of net periodic  benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. The full yield curve approach refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the
individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These
individual spot rates align with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost.
Income T axes
Our current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in
connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and non-recurring items. As a global
commercial enterprise, our income tax rate and the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors, including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred
income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We account for tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the
accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to
be taken in a tax return. We review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at
each reporting date. To the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amou nts recorded, such differences may impact income tax expense and
actual tax payments. We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefit s in income tax expense. Actual tax payments may materially differ
from estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well
as unanticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances. See Note 12  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Property , Plant and Equipment
Our Property , plant and equipment  balanc e represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record Property , plant and equipment  at cost. We depreciate
Property , plant and equipment  on a straight -line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We expect that a one year increase in estimated useful lives of our Property ,
plant and equipment  would result in a decrease to our 2019  depreciation expense of $2.7 billion  and that a one year decrease would result in an increase of approximately $4.7
billion  in our 2019  depreciation expense.
Accounts Receivable
We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated losses resulting from the
failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-channel device payment loans are considered financial instruments and are initially recorded at fair
value net of imputed interest, and credit losses are recorded as incurred. However , loan balances are assess ed quarterly for impairment and an allowance is recorded if the loan
is considered impaired. Our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is based on management’ s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and
includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those customers. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is reasonably
believed to be collectible. We also record an allowance for all other receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic
environment and the aging  of such receivables. Similar to traditional service revenue, we record direct device payment plan agreement bad debt expense based on an estimate
of the percent age of equipment revenue that will not be collected. This estimate is based on a number of factors including historical write-of f experience, credit quality of the
customer base and other factors such as macroeconomic conditions.  If there is a deterioration  of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on
receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the
adjustments are made.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
See Note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standard updates not yet adopted as of December 31, 2019 .
Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisition of AOL Inc.
In May 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with AOL Inc. pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of AOL at a price of  $50.00  per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary  of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the
closing of these transaction s was approximately  $3.8 billion . Holders of approximately  6.6 million  shares exercised appraisal rights under Delaware law. In September 2018,
we obtained court approval to settle this matter for total cash consideration of $219 million , of which an insignificant amount relates to interest, resulting in an insignificant
gain. W e paid the cash consideration in October 2018.
XO Holdings
In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire  XO Holdings' wireline business (XO), which owned and operated one of the largest fiber-based  IP and
Ethernet networks in the U.S. Concurrently , we entered into a separate agreement to utilize certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO Holdings,
NextLink , that held XO's millimeter -wave wireless spectrum. The agreement included an option, subject to certain  conditions, to acquire NextLink. In February 2017, we
completed our acquisition of XO for total cash consideration of approximately  $1.5 billion , of which  $100 million  was paid in 2015, and we prepaid  $320 million  in connection
with the NextLink option which represented the fair value of the option.
In April 2017, we exercise d our option to buy NextL ink for approximately  $493 million , subject to certain adjustme nts, of which  $320 million  was prepaid in the first quarter
of 2017. The transaction closed in January 2018. The acquisition of NextLink was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired
spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded approximately  $657 million  of wireless licenses, $110 million  of a deferred tax liability and $58 million  of other liabilities.  See Note 3  to
the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Straight Path
In May 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Straight Path , a holder of millimeter wave spectrum configured for 5G wireless services, for total consideration
reflecting an enterprise value of approximately  $3.1 billion . Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we agreed to pay: (1) Straight Path shareholders  $184.00  per share,
payable in Verizon shares; and (2) certain transaction  costs payable in cash of approximately  $736 million , consisting primarily of a fee to be paid to the FCC.  The transaction
closed in February 2018 at which time we issued
approximately  49 million shares of Verizon common stock, valued at approximately  $2.4 billion , and paid the associated cash consideration. See Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information.
Spectrum License Transactions
From time to time, we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe these spectrum license transactions have allowed us to continue to enhance
the reliability  of our wirele ss network while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum. See Note 3  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information
regarding our spectrum license transactions.
Other
From time to time, we enter into strategic agreements to acquire various other businesses and investment s. See Note 3  to the consol idated financ ial statements for additional
information.

Opinion on Internal Contr ol Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries’ (Verizon) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in
Internal Cont rol-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our
opinion, V erizon maintained, in all material respects, ef fective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria.
We also have  audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of
Verizon as of December 31, 2019  and 2018 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2020  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
Verizon’ s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Verizon's
internal control over finan cial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
Verizon in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether ef fective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtainin g an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Contr ol Over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting  is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accord ance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the mainten ance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit prepar ation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provi de reasonabl e assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisit ion, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a
material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consol idated financial statements present fairly , in all material respects, the
financial position of Verizon at December 31, 2019  and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standard s of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boar d (United States) (PCAOB), Verizon’ s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria establis hed in Internal Control–In tegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2020  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
ASU No. 2016-02
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2019, Verizon changed its method of accounting for leases due to the adoption of
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (T opic 842), and the related amendments, using the modified retrospective method.
ASU No. 2014-09
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2018 Verizon changed its method for recognizing revenue as a result of the adoption of
ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and the amendments in ASUs 2015-14, 2016-08, 2016-10 and 2016-12 using the modified
retrospective method.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Verizon’ s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Verizon’ s financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Verizon in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material  misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financ ial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included  evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. W e believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,
and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below , providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate.
 Impairment Evaluation for W ireline Goodwill
Description of the Matter At March 31, 2019, the Company’ s goodwill related to its historical Wireline reporting unit was $3.9 billion and represented 1.4% of total
assets. As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment
at the reportin g unit level at least annually , or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The impairment test compares the fair
value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method) to its carrying
amount. Effective April 1, 2019, the Company transi tioned to its new segment reporting structure, which resulted in certain changes to its
operating segments and reporting units. On March 31, 2019 the Company performed an impairment assessment of the impacted reporting
units, including the W ireline reporting unit, immediately before the segment reor ganization became ef fective.
Auditing management’ s goodwill impairment test was complex and highly judgmental due to the inherent subjectivity of developing an
estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit, which is based on assumptions about future condition s, transactions, or events whose
outcome is uncertain and will therefore be subject to change over time. In particular , the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant
assumptions such as the weighted average cost of capital, revenue growth rate and operating margin, which are affected by expected future
market or economic conditions.
How W e Addr essed the Matter in
Our AuditWe obtained an understan ding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’ s goodwill
impairment review process . For example, we tested controls over the Company’ s development of prospective financial information and
management’ s review of other key assumptions.
To test the estimated fair value of the Company’ s Wireline reporting unit prior to segment reorganization, our audit procedures included,
among others, assessing the suitability and application of the valuation methodologies selected and evaluating the significant assumptions
discussed above and under lying data used by the Com pany in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management
to current industry and economic trends, changes in the Company’ s business model, customer base or product mix and other relevant
factors. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to determine what changes in assumptions are particularly sensitive
when assessin g the likelihood of impairment, or when calculating the amount of an impairment. In addition, we involved a valuation
specialist to assist in the evaluation of the assumptions and other relevant information that are most significant to the fair value estimate.
We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’ s forecasts of financial results used in developing prior fair value estimates to
assist in evaluating the reliability of the current forecasts.
 Valuation of Employee Benefit Obligations
Description of the Matter The Company sponsors several pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans. At December 31, 2019, the Company’ s aggregate
defined benefit pension obligation was $21.2 billion  and exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets of $19.4 billion, resulting in an
unfunded defined benefit pension obligation of $1.8 billion. Also, at December 31, 2019, the other postretirement benefits obligation was
approximately $15.7 billion. As explained in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements, the Compa ny updates the estimates used to
measure employee benefit obligations and plan assets in the fourth quarter and upon a remeasurement event to reflect the actual return on
plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions.
Auditing the employee benefit obligations was comp lex due to the highly judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions (e.g., discount
rate, health care cost trends, per capita claims cost trends and mortality rates) used in the measurement process. These assumptions had a
significant ef fect on the projected benefit obligation.
How W e Addr essed the Matter in
Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the employee benefits obligation
valuation process. For example, we tested controls over management’ s review of the employee benefit obligation calculations, the
significant actuarial assumptions and the data inputs provided to the actuary .
To test the employee benefit obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used, the significant
actuarial assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company . We compared the actuarial assumptions used by
management to historical trends, current economic factors and evaluated the change in the employee benefit obligations from prior year due
to the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other activities. In addition, we
involved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating management’ s methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the
maturity and duration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the employee benefit obligations . As part of this assessment, we
compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash
flows. To evaluate the health care cost trends, per capita claims cost trends and the mortality rates, we involved an actuarial specialist to
assist in evaluating the assumptions and assessed whether the information is consistent with publicly available information, and whether
any market data adjusted for entity-specific adjustments were applied. W e also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data,
including the participant data provided to management’ s actuarial specialists.
 Income T axes - Benefit from the disposition of stock of a foreign af filiate
Description of the Matter As described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial  statements, during the fourth quarter of 2019 the Com pany sold a minority interest in
a foreign af filiate to unrelated parties resulting in the recognition of a tax benefit of approximately $2.2 billion.
Auditing the recognition and measurement of this income tax benefit required significant auditor judgment because the determination of
whether the tax positions’ technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained in an audit by a taxing authority is based on the
application and interpretation of the relevant tax laws to the facts of the specific transaction.
How W e Addr essed the Matter in
Our AuditWe obtained an understan ding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’ s income tax
processes. For example, we tested controls over management’ s review of the income tax technical merits of the transaction and the related
recognition and measurement of the income tax benefit.
To test the income tax benefit related to this transaction, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the suitability and
application of tax laws and legal rulings and evaluating the related conclusions. In addition, we involved our tax professionals to assist in
the review and evaluation of management’ s third-party tax opinions and memoranda and other relev ant agreements. We tested the
completeness and accuracy of the data and calculations used to determine the amount of the income tax benefit recognized.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries
Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Verizon Comm unications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’ s leading providers of communications,
information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video
services and solutions on our networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility , reliable network connectivity , security and control.
In November 2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business.  Under the new structure, effective April 1, 2019, there are two reportable segments that we
operate and manage as strategic business units  - Verizon Consumer Group ( Consumer ) and Verizon Business Group ( Business ).
Our Consume r segment provides consumer -focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most
extensive wireless networks in the United States  (U.S.) under the Verizon brand and through wholesale and other arrangements. Our wireline services are provided in nine
states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic  network under the Fios brand and over a traditional copper -based
network to customers who are not served by Fios.  Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers
that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis.
Our Business  segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed
network servi ces, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various  Internet of Things  (IoT)  services and products. We provide these products and
services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world.
Consolidation
The method of accounting  applied to investments, whether consolidated or equity , involves an evaluation of all significant terms of the investments that explicitly grant or
suggest evide nce of control or influence over the operations of the investee. The consolidated financial statements include our controlled subsidiaries, as well as variable
interest entitie s (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary . For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, the noncontrolling interests are included in
Net income and Total equity . Investments in businesses that we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are
accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments are included in Investments in unconso lidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
We prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could dif fer from those estimates.
Examples of significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, the recoverability of property , plant and equipment, the incremental borrowing rate for the lease
liability , the recoverability of intangible assets and other long-lived assets, fair value measurements, including those related to financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum
licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the
identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations.
Revenue Recognition
We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment. These
services include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our Consumer and Business customers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide
services to their customers, as well as professional and integrated managed services for our large enterpris es and government customers. We account for these revenues under
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606), which we adopted on  January 1, 2018 , using the modified retrospective
approach.  This standard  update, along with related subsequentl y issued updates, clarifies the principles for recogniz ing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for
GAAP . The standard update also amends current guidance for the recognition of costs to obtain and fulfill contracts with customers such that incremental costs of obtaining and
direct costs of fulfilling contracts with customers are deferred and amortized consistent with the transfer of the related good or service.
We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from  leasin g arran gements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements
primarily related to wirele ss device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized
agent.
Natur e of Pr oducts and Services
Telecommunications
Service
We offer wireless services through a variety of plans  on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service,  we recognize revenue using an output method, either as the service
allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer .
Monthly service is generally billed in advance, which  results in a contract liability . See Note 2  for additiona l information . For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the
allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option
(typically on a month-to-month basis).
For our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance, which results in a
contract liabil ity, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the
benefits of the services through network access and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks,
revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.
Equipment
We sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer ,
as this is when control passes to the customer . In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay
for a wireless device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans.
Under a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discou nted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service contract
(typically for a term of 24 months  or less).
Under a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid by the customer , typically over a
24-month term,  and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a
specified term, contingent upon the customer maintai ning service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on
their relative selling price and are recognized when earned.
A financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term,
differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the customer . We periodically assess, at the
contract level , the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative considerations
related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates
prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and
circumstances, we determined that the financing component in our existing wireless device payments and fixed-term contracts sold through the direct channel is not significant
and therefore is not accounted for separately . See Note 8  for additional information on the interest on equipme nt financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the
customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel.
Wireless Contracts
For our wireless contracts , total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated between service and
equipment revenue based on their estimated standal one selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding
subsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estim ate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts
that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless
device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties
that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is canceled. The
assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of the transaction price and related disclosures.
From time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified
portion of their device payment plan agreement amou nt and trading in their device in good working order . We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full
amount of the trade-in right's fair value is recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the device. The guarantee
liability was insignificant  at December 31, 2019  and 2018 . The total transaction price is reduced by the guarantee, which is accounted for outside the scope of Topic 606, and
the remaining transaction price is allocated between the performance obligations within the contract.
Our fixed-term  plans generally include the sale of a wireless device at subsidized prices. This results in the creation of a contract asset at the time of sale, which represents the
recognition of equipment revenue in excess of amounts billed.
For our device payment plans, billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and are included in the determination of total transaction price, resulting
in a contract liability .
We may provide a right of return on our products and services for a short time period after a sale. These rights are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the
transaction price, and accordingly we recognize revenue based on the estimated amount to which we expect to be entitled after considering expected returns. Returns and
credits are estimated at contract inception and upda ted at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We also may provide credits or
incentives on our products and services for contracts with resellers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize.
Wireline Contracts
Total consideration for wireline services that are bund led in a single contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on our standalone selling price for each service.
While many contracts include one or more service performance obligations, the revenue recognition patte rn is generally not impacted by the allocation since the services are
generally satisfied over the same period of time. We estimate the standalone selling price to be the price of the services when sold on a standalone basis without any
promotional discount. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers such
as pena lties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment
and impacts our determination of transaction price and related disclosures.
We may provide performa nce-based credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts with our Business customers, which are accounted for as variable
consideration when estimating the transaction price. Credits are estimated at contract inception and are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information
becomes available.
Wireless and W ireline Contracts
For offers that include third-party providers, we evaluate whether we are acting as the principal or as the agent with respect to the goods or services provided to the customer .
This principal-versus-agen t assessment involves judgment and focuses on whether the facts and circumstances of the arrangement indicate that the goods or services were
controlled by us prior to transferring them to the customer . To evaluate if we have control, we consider various factors including whether we are primarily responsible for
fulfillment, bear risk of loss and have discretion over pricing.
Other
Advertising revenues are generated through display advertising and search advertising. Display advertising  revenue is generated by the display of graphical advertisements and
other performance-based advertising. Search advertising revenue is generated when a consumer clicks on a text-based advertisement on the search results page. Our Media
business, Verizon Media, primarily earns revenue through display advertising on Verizon Media properties, as well as on third-party properties through our advertising
platforms, search advertising and subscription arran gements. Revenue for display and search advertising contracts is recognized as ads are delivered, while subscription
contracts are recognized over time. We are generally the principal in transactions carried out through our advertising platforms, and therefore report gross revenue based on the
amount billed to our customers. The control and transfer of digital advertising inventory occurs in a rapid, real-time environment, where our proprietary technology enables us
to identify, enhance, verify  and solely control digital advertising inventory that we then sell to our customers. Our control is further supported by us being primarily responsible
to our customers for fulfillment and the fact that we can exercise a level of discretion over pricing.
We offer telematics services including smart fleet management and optimization software. T elematics service revenue is generated primarily through subscription contracts. W e
recognize revenue over time for our subscription contracts.
We report taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions on a net basis.
Maintenance and Repairs
We char ge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not constituting substantial betterments, principally to Cost of services as these costs
are incurred.
Advertising Costs
Costs for advertising products and services, as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs, are charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the periods in
which they are incurred. See Note 15  for additional information.
Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Where appropriate, diluted earnings per common share
include the dilutive ef fect of shares issuable under our stock-based compensation plans.
There were a total of approximately 2 million , 4 million  and 5 million  outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of restricted stock units, included in the computation
of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectively .
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates quoted market value and includes amounts held in money market funds.
Cash collecti ons on the device payment plan agree ment receivables collateralizing asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be placed into
segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated
balance sheets.
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are included in the following line items in the consolidated balance sheets:
 (dollars in millions)  
At December 31, 2019  2018  Increase /
(Decrease)
Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,594  $ 2,745  $ (151)
Restricted cash:      
Prepaid expenses and other 1,221  1,047  174
Other assets 102  124  (22)
Cash, cash equivalents and r estricted cash $ 3,917  $ 3,916  $ 1
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
Investments in equity securities that are not accounted  for under equity method accounting or result in consolidation are to be measured at fair value. For investments in equity
securities without readily determinable fair values, Verizon elects the measurement alternative permi tted under GAAP to measure these investments at cost, less any
impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer . For investments in
debt securities without quoted prices, Verizon uses an alternative matrix pricing method. Investments in equity securities that do not result in consolidation of the investee are
included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses and debt securities are included in Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at cost net of an allowance for credit losses, with the exception of indirect-channel device payment
plan loans. We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated losses
resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-channel device payment loans are considered financial instruments and are initially
recorded at fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses are recorded as incurred. However , loan balances are assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance is
recorded if the loan is considered impaired. Our allow ance for uncollectible accounts receivable is based on management’ s assessment of the collectability of specific customer
accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those customers. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is
reasonably believed to be collectible. We also record an allowance for all other receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general
economic environment and the aging of such receivables. Similar to traditional service revenue, we record direct device payment plan agreement bad debt expense based on an
estimate of the percentage of equipment revenue that will not be collected. This estimate is based on a number of factors including historical write-of f experience, credit quality
of the custom er base and other factors such as macroeconomic conditions.  We monitor the aging of our accounts with device payment plan agreement receivables and write-of f
account balances if collection ef forts are unsuccessful and future collection is unlikely .
Inventories
Inventory consists of wirel ess and wireline equipment held for sale, which is carried at the lower of cost (determined principally on either an average cost or first-in, first-out
basis) or net realizable value.
Plant and Depreciation
We record property , plant and equipment at cost. Property , plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining term of the related lease, calculated from the time the asset
was placed in service.
When depreciable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are deducted from the property , plant and equipment accounts and
any gains or losses on disposition are recognized in income.
We capitalize and depreciate network software purchased or developed within property , plant and equipment assets. We also capitalize interest associated with the acquisition
or construction of network-related assets. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated as part of the cost of the network-related assets.
In connection  with our ongoing review of the estimated useful lives of property , plant and equipment during 2018 , we determined that the average useful lives of certain assets
would be increased. These changes in estimates were applied prospectively in 2018 and resulted in a decrease to
depreciation expense of $271 million  for the year ended Decem ber 31, 2018 . While  the timing and extent of current deployment plans are subject to ongoing analysis and
modification, we believe that the current estimates of useful lives are reasonable.
Computer Software Costs
We capitalize the cost of internal-use network and non-network software that has a useful life in excess of one year. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to
internal-use network and non-network software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. Planning,
software main tenance and training costs are expense d in the period in which they are incurred. Also, we capitalize interest associated with the development of internal-use
network and non-network software. Capitalized non-network internal-use software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 3 to 7 years and are
included in Other intangib le assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. For a discussion of our impair ment policy for capitalized software costs, see "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets" below . Also, see Note 4  for additional information of internal-use non-network software reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of busin esses over the fair value of the identifiable net asset s acquired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed annually in
the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators are present.
To determine  if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment. However , we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and
perform a quantitative impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist. The quantitative impairment test for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit
level and compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method) to its carrying value.
Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value hierarchy , see Fair V alue Measurements discussion below for additional information.
Under the qualitative assessment, we consider severa l qualitative factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the
excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations
(including industry revenu e and Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA ) margin projections), the recent and projected financial perfor mance
of the reporting unit, as well as other factors.
The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples of guideline companies to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based
on the present value of two components, a projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting
unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from
the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate  of the weighted-average cost of capital, or expected return, that a
marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is booked for the excess carrying value
over fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwi ll of that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter each year, we update our five-year strategic planning review for each of
our reporting units. Those plans consider current econ omic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, our view of growth-rates and-anticipated future economic
and regulatory conditions.
See Note 4  for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing.
Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization
A significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum to
provide wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover , we have determined that there are currently no legal,
regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived
intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determ ination for wireless licenses each year to determine  whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite
useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless
network.
We test our wireless licen ses for potential impairme nt annually or more frequently if impairment indic ators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However , we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and
proceed directly to perform ing the quantitative impair ment test. Our quantitative assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to
the aggregate d carrying amount as of the test date. Using a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach.
The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up
company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant
would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the
aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses,  then an impairment charge is recognized. As part of our qualitative assessment, we consider several qualitative factors
including the business enterprise value of our historical Wireless segment, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and
market considerations
(including industry revenu e and EBITDA margin projections), the recent and projected financial performa nce of our historical Wireless segment, as well as other factors. See
Note 4  for additional information regarding our impairment tests.
Interest expen se incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization
period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.
Wireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and purchase licenses are recorded as
other non-current assets until the corresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets
Our intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal- use software) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. All of
our intangible assets subject to amortization and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group
to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform
the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment, if any. We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each
year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.
For informati on related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other
acquired intangible assets, see Note 4 .
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the
methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows:
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 3—Unobservable pricing inputs in the market
Financial assets and financ ial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their
categorization within the fair value hierarchy .
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we
operate.
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are
recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record valuation allowances to reduce
our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is
more likely than not that a tax position will be sustain ed upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of
the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate
taxing authori ty that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is
measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50
percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will
generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax
asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability .
Significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our ef fective tax rate.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure and recognize  compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. See Note 10  for
additional information.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency . For these foreign entities, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars using
average excha nge rates for the period for income statement amounts and using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities. We record these translation adjustments
in Accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of Equity , in our consolidated balance sheets. We record exchange gains and losses resulting from the
conversion of transaction currency to functional currency as a component of Other income (expense), net.
Employee Benefit Plans
Pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits earned during the year, as well as interest on projected benefit obligations, are accrued. Prior service costs
and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. Expected
return on plan assets is determined by applying the return on assets assumption to the actual fair value of plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in Other income
(expense), net in the year in which they occur . These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. Verizon management
employees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the Company retiree medical subsidy . See Note 1 1 for additional information.
We recognize a pension or a postretirement plan’ s funded status as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Also, we measure any unrecognized prior
service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income tax.
Derivative Instruments
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We employ risk management
strategies, which may inclu de the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and
foreign exchange forwards. W e do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.
We measure all derivatives  at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities in our consolida ted balance sheets. Our derivative instruments are valued primarily
using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair values of
derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized in earnings in the current period . For fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative
instruments is recognized in earnings, along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative
instruments is reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For net investment hedges of certain
of our foreign operations, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative translation
adjustment and partially of fset the impact of foreign currency changes on the value of our net investment. See Note 9  for additional information.
Variable Interest Entities
VIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additio nal subordinated financial support from other parties, have equity
investors that do not have the ability to make signifi cant decisions relating to the entity’ s operations through voting rights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected
losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual  returns of the entity . We consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary .
The primary beneficiary is the party that has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to
absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
The following ASUs were issued by Financial Accounting Standards Board (F ASB), and have been recently adopted by V erizon.
 DescriptionDate of
AdoptionEffect on Financial Statements
 ASU 2016-02, ASU 2018-01, ASU 2018-10, ASU 2018-1 1, ASU 2018-20 and ASU 2019-01, Leases (T opic 842)
 The F ASB issued T opic 842 requiring entities to recognize assets and liabilities on
the balance sheet for all leases, with certain exceptions. In addition, T opic 842
enables users of financial statements to further understand the amount, timing and
uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. T opic 842 allowed for a modified
retrospective application and was ef fective as of the first quarter of 2019. Entities
were allowed to apply the modified retrospective approach: (1) retrospectively to
each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements with the
cumulative-ef fect adjustment recognized at the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented; or (2) retrospectively at the beginning of the period
of adoption (January 1, 2019) through a cumulative-ef fect adjustment. The modified
retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that
entities may elect to apply .1/1/2019We adopted T opic 842 beginning on January 1, 2019, using the
modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-ef fect adjustment to
opening retained earnings recorded at the beginning of the period of
adoption. Therefore, upon adoption, we have recognized and measured
leases without revising comparative period information or disclosure.
We recorded an increase of $410 million (net of tax) to retained
earnings on January 1, 2019 which related to deferred sale leaseback
gains recognized from prior transactions. Additionally , the adoption of
the standard had a significant impact in our consolidated balance sheet
due to the recognition of $22.1 billion of operating lease liabilities,
along with $23.2 billion of operating lease right-of-use-assets. 
 
The cumulative after -tax ef fect of the changes made to our consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of T opic 842 were as follows:
(dollars in millions) At December 31, 2018  Adjustments due to
Topic 842  At January 1, 2019
Prepaid expenses and other $ 5,453  $ (329) $ 5,124
Operating lease right-of-use assets — 23,241  23,241
Other assets 11,717  (2,048 ) 9,669
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 22,501  (3) 22,498
Other current liabilities 8,239  (2) 8,237
Current operating lease liabilities — 2,931  2,931
Deferred income taxes 33,795  139  33,934
Non-current operating lease liabilities — 19,203  19,203
Other liabilities 13,922  (1,815 ) 12,107
Retained earnings 43,542  410  43,952
Noncontrolling interests 1,565  1 1,566
In addition to the increase  to the operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets and the derecognition of deferred sale leaseback gains through opening retained earnings,
Topic 842 also resulted in reclassifying the presentati on of prepaid and deferred rent to operating lease right-of-use assets. The operating lease right-of-use assets amount also
includes the balance of any prepaid lease payments, unamortized initial direct costs and lease incentives.
We elected the package of practical expedients permi tted under the transition guidance within the new standard. Accordingly , we have adopted these practical expedients and
did not reassess: (1) whether an expired or existing contract is a lease or contains an embedded lease; (2) lease classification of an expired or existing lease; or (3) capitalization
of initial direct costs for an expired or existing lease. In addition, we have elected the land easement trans ition practical expedient, and did not reassess whether an existing or
expired land easement is a lease or contains a lease if it has not historically been accounted for as a lease.
We lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which include dark fiber, equipment, and other
various types  of assets for use in our operations under both operating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For
arrangements considered leases or that contain a lease that is accounted for separately , we determine the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and
lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use.
For both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability , which
represents the present value of our obligation to make payments arising over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental
borrowing rate for operating and finance leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company would
have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Management uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that
rate to approximate a collateralized rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis.
In those circumstances where the Company is the lessee, we have elected to account for non-lease components associated with our leases (e.g., common area maintenance
costs) and lease componen ts as a single lease compo nent for substantially all of our asset classes. Additionally , in arrangements where we are the lessor , we have customer
premise equipment for which we apply the lease and non-lease component practical expedient and account for non-lease components (e.g., service revenue) and lease
components as combined components under the revenue recognition guidance in T opic 606 as the service revenues are the predominant components in the arrangements.
Rent expense for operatin g leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included in either Cost of services or Selling, general and
administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income, based on the use of the facility or equipment on which rent is being paid. Variable rent payments related to
both operating and finance  leases are expensed in the period incurred. Our variable lease payments consist of payments dependent on various external indicators, including real
estate taxes, common area maintenance char ges and utility usage.
Operating leases with a term of 12 months  or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize rent expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We recognize the amortization of the right-of-use asset for our finance leases on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use asset
in Depreciatio n and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of income. The interest expense related to finance leases is recognized using the effective interest
method based on the discount rate determined at lease commencement and is included within Interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.
See Note 6  for additional information related to leases, including disclosure required under T opic 842.
Opening Equity Balance Sheet Adjustments fr om Accounting Standards Adopted in 2018
On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606, ASU 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income and other ASUs. We adopted Topic 606 using the modified
retrospective method. We early adopted ASU 2018-0 2, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax
effects resulti ng from Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The cumulative after-tax effect of the changes made to our consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of Topic 606,
ASU 2018-02 and other ASUs was as follows:
   Adjustments due to   
(dollars in millions) At December 31, 2017  Topic 606  ASU 2018-02  Other ASUs  At January 1,
2018
Retained earnings 35,635  2,890  (652) (6) 37,867

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
The following ASUs have been recently issued by the F ASB.
 Description Date of Adoption Effect on Financial Statements
 ASU 2016-13, ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Cr edit Losses (T opic 326)
 In June 2016, the F ASB issued this standard update which requires certain
financial assets be measured at amortized cost net of an allowance for
estimated credit losses such that the net receivable represents the present
value of expected cash collection. In addition, this standard update requires
that certain financial assets be measured at amortized cost reflecting an
allowance for estimated credit losses expected to occur over the life of the
assets. The estimate of credit losses must be based on all relevant
information including historical information, current conditions and
reasonable and supportable forecasts that af fect the collectability of the
amounts. An entity will apply the update through a cumulative ef fect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting
period in which the guidance is ef fective (January 1, 2020). A prospective
transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other -than-
temporary impairment has been recognized before the ef fective date. Early
adoption of this standard is permitted.1/1/2020We established a cross-functional coordinated team to implement the
standard update. W e have completed our assessment of the expected
impacts and updated our processes to meet the standards reporting and
disclosure requirements. Upon adoption of this standard on January 1,
2020, we expect the cumulative ef fect of initially applying the new
standard to result in a decrease to the opening balance of retained
earnings ranging from approximately $200 million to $300 million on a
pre-tax basis ($150 million to $225 million net of tax), primarily related
to the expected impact on certain device payment plan agreement
receivables. W e do not expect our operating results to be significantly
impacted by this standard update. 
 
Note 2. Revenue and Contract Costs
We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment. These
services include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our Consumer and Business customers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide
services to their customers, as well as professional and integrated managed services for our large enterpris es and government customers. We account for these revenues under
Topic 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018 , using the modified retrospective approach.  We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from  leasing
arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related  to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed
under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent.
We applied the new revenue recognition standard to customer contracts not completed at the date of initial adoption. For incomplete contracts that were modified before the
date of adoption, the Company elected to use the practical expedient available under the modified retrospective method, which allows us to aggregate the effect of all
modifications when identifying satisfied and unsati sfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price and allocating transaction price to the satisfied and
unsatisfied performance obligations for the modified contract at transition. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while
amounts reported for prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under accounting standards in ef fect for those periods.
Prior to the adoption of Topic 606, we were required to limit the revenue recognized when a wireless devic e was sold to the amount of consideration that was not contingent on
the provision of future services, which was typically limited to the amount of consideration received from the customer at the time of sale. Under Topic 606, the total
consideration in the contract is allocated between wireless equipment and service based on their relative standalone selling prices. This change primarily impacts our
arrangements that include sales of wireless devices at subsidized prices in conjunction with a fixed-term plan, also known as the subsidy model, for service. Accordingly , under
Topic 606, generally more equipment revenue is recognized upon sale of the equipment to the customer and less service revenue is recognized over the contract term than was
previously recognized under the prior "Revenue Recognition" (T opic 605) standard. At the time the equipment is sold, this allocation results in the recognition
of a contract asset equal to the difference between the amount of revenue recognized and the amount of consideration received from the customer . As of January 2017, we no
longer offer Consumer customers new fixed-term plans with subsidized equipment pricing; however , we continue to offer fixed-term plans to our Business customers. At
December 31, 2019  and December 31, 2018 , approximately 12% and 14% of retail postpaid connections were under fixed-term plans, respectively .
Topic 606 also requires the deferral of incremental costs incurred to obtain a customer contract, which are then amortized to expense, as a component of Selling, general and
administrative expense, over the respective periods of expected benefit. As a result, a significant amount of our sales commission costs, which were historically expensed as
incurred under our previous accounting, relating to our contracts to provide wireless and wireline services, are now deferred and amortized under T opic 606.
Finally , under  Topic 605, at the time of the sale of a device, we imputed risk adjusted interest on the device payment plan agreement receivables. We recorded the imputed
interest as a reduction to the related accounts receivable and interest income was recognized over the finan ced device payment term. Under Topic 606, while there continues to
be a financing  component in both the fixed-term plans and device payment plans, also known as the instal lment model, we have determined that this financing component for
our customer classes in the direct channels for wireless devices are not significant and therefore we no longer impute interest for these contracts. This change results in
additional revenue recognized upon the sale of wireless devices and no interest income recognized over the device payment term.
A reconciliation of the adjustments from the adoption of Topic 606 relative to Topic 605 on certain impacted financial statement line items in our consolidated statements of
income is as follows:

Revenue by Category
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units , Consumer and Business. Revenue is disaggregated by products and services within
Consumer , and customer groups (Global Enterprise, Small and Medium Business, Public Sector and Other , and Wholesale) within Business. See Note 13 for additional
information on revenue by segment.
Corporate and other includes the results of our media business, Verizon Media, and other businesses. Verizon Media generated revenues from contracts with customers under
Topic 606 of approximately $7.5 billion  and $7.7 billion  for the years ended December 31, 2019  and 2018 , respectively .
We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from  leasin g arran gements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements
primarily related to wirele ss device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized
agent. As allowed by the practical expedient within Topic 842, we have elected to combine the lease and non-lease components for those arrangements of customer premise
equipment where we are the lessor as components accounted for under Topic 606. Revenues from arrangements that were not accounted for under Topic 606 were
approximately $3.1 billion  and $4.5 billion  for the years ended December 31, 2019  and 2018 , respectively .
Remaining Performance Obligations
When allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion of the total transaction price may relate to service performance obligations
which were not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period. Below we disclose
information relating to these unsatisfied performance obligations. Upon adoption, we elected to apply the practical expedient available under Topic 606 that provides the option
to exclude the expected revenues arising from unsatis fied performance obligations related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less. This situation
primarily arises with respect to certain month-to-month service contracts. At December 31, 2019 , mont h-to-month service contracts represented approximately 88% of our
wireless postpaid contracts and 61% of our wireline Consumer and Small and Medium Business contracts, compared to December 31, 2018 , for which month-to-month service
contracts represented approximately 86% of our wireless postpaid contracts and 56% of our wireline Consumer and Small and Medium Business contracts .
Additionally , certain contracts provide customers the option to purchase additional services. The fees related to these additional services are recognized when the customer
exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).
Contracts for wireless services are generally either month-to-month and cancellable at any time (typically under a device payment plan) or contain terms ranging from greater
than one month to up to two years (typically under a fixed-term plan).  Additionally , customers may incur charges based on usage or additional optional services purchased in
conjunction with entering into a contract that can be cancelled at any time and therefore are not included in the transaction price. The transaction price allocated to service
performance obligations, which are not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period, are generally related to our fixed-term plans.
Our Consume r group customers also include traditional wholesale resellers that purchase and resell wireless service under their own brands to their respective customers.
Reseller arran gements generally include a stated contract term, which typically extends longer than two years and, in some cases, include a periodic minimum revenue
commitment over the contract term for which revenues will be recognized in future periods.
Consumer customer contracts for wireline services generally have a service term of two years ; however , this term may be shorter than twelve months or may be month-to-
month. Certain contracts with Business customers for wireline services extend into future periods, contai n fixed monthly fees and usage-based fees, and can include annual
commitments in each year of the contract or commit ments over the entire specified contract term; howev er, a significant number of contracts for wireline services with our
Business customers have a contract term that is twelve months  or less.
Additionally , there are certain contracts with Business customers for wireline and telematics services and certain Media contracts with customers that have a contractual
minimum fee over the total contract term. We cannot predict the time period when revenue will be recogn ized related to those contracts; thus, they are excluded from the time
bands below . These contracts have varying terms spanning over approximately five years  ending in November 2024  and have aggregate contract minimum payments totaling
$3.4 billion .
At December 31, 2019 , the transaction price related to unsatisfied performan ce obligations for total Verizon that is expected to be recognized for 2020 , 2021  and thereafter was
$20.2 billion , $9.4 billion  and $1.6 billion , respectively . Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including
terminations and changes in the timing and scope of contracts, arising from contract modifications.
Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to our customers. Receivables presented in our consolidated balance sheet represent an unconditional
right to consideration. Contract balances represent amounts from an arrangement when either Verizon has performed, by transferring goods or services to the customer in
advance of receiving all or partial consideration for such goods and services from the customer , or the customer has made payment to Verizon in advance of obtaining control
of the goods and/or services promised to the customer in the contract.
The following table presents information about receivables from contracts with customers:
 At December  31,  At December 31,  At January 1,
(dollars in millions) 2019  2018  2018
Receivables(1)$ 12,078  $ 12,104  $ 12,073
Device payment plan agreement receivables(2)11,741  8,940  1,461
(1) Balances do not include receivables related to the following contracts:  leasin g arran gements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements
primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device paym ent plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized
agent.
(2) Included in device paymen t plan agreement receivables presented in Note 8 . Balances do not include receivables related to contracts completed prior to January 1, 2018 and
receivables derived from the sale of equipment on a device payment plan through an authorized agent.
The following table presents information about contract balances:
 At December  31,  At December 31,  At January 1,
(dollars in millions) 2019  2018  2018
Contract asset $ 1,150  $ 1,003  $ 1,170
Contract liability 5,307  4,943  4,452
Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consid eration for goods or services provided to customers but for which we do not have an unconditional right at the reporting
date. Under a fixed-term plan, total contract revenue is allocated between wireless service and equipment revenues, as discussed above. In conjunction with these
arrangements, a contract asset is created, which represents the difference between the amount of equipm ent revenue recognized upon sale and the amount of consideration
received from  the customer when the performance obligation related to the transfer of control of the equipment is satisfied. The contract asset is reclassified to accounts
receivable as wireless services are provided and billed. We have the right to bill the customer as service is provided over time, which results in our right to the payment being
unconditional. The contract asset balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets. We assess our contract assets for
impairment on a quarterly basis and will recognize an impairment char ge to the extent their carrying amount is not recoverable.
Contract assets increased $147 million  during the year ended December 31, 2019 . The change in the contract asset balance was primarily due to new contracts and increases in
sales promotions recognized upfront, driven by customer activity related to wireless and Fios services, partially offset by reclassifications to accounts receivable due to billings
on existing contracts and impairment charges of $113 million . Contract assets decreased $167 million  during the year ended December 31, 2018 . The change in the contract
asset balance was primarily  due to reclassifications to accounts receivable due to billings on existing contracts and impairment charges of $116 million , offset by new contracts
related to wireless and Fios services.
Contract liabilities arise when we bill our customers and receive consideration in advance of providing the goods or services promised in the contract. We typically bill service
one month in advance, which is the primary component of the contract liability balance. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when services are provided to the
customer . The contract liability balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities.
Contract liabilities increased $364 million  during the year ended December 31, 2019 . The change in contract liabilities was primarily due to increases in sales promotions
recognized over time and upfront fees, as well as increases in deferred revenue related to advanced billings, partially offset by the satisfaction of performance obligations
related to wireless and Fios services. Contract liabilities increased $491 million  during the year ended December 31, 2018 . The change in contract liabilities was primarily due
to increases in sales promo tions, as well as increases in deferred revenue related to advanced billings, partially offset by the satisfaction of performance obligations related to
wireless and Fios services.
Revenue recognized during  the years ended December 31, 2019  and 2018  related to contract liabiliti es existing at January 1, 2019  and 2018  were $4.2 billion  and $3.9 billion ,
respectively , as performance obligations related to services were satisfied.
The balance of contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:
At December  31,  At December 31,
(dollars in millions) 2019  2018
Assets    
Prepaid expenses and other $ 848  $ 757
Other assets 302  246
Total $ 1,150  $ 1,003
    
Liabilities    
Other current liabilities $ 4,651  $ 4,207
Other liabilities 656  736
Total $ 5,307  $ 4,943
Contract Costs
As discussed in Note 1, Topic 606 requires the recognition of an asset for incremental costs to obtain a customer contract, which is then amortized to expense over the
respective period of expected benefit. We recognize an asset for incremental commission costs paid to internal and external sales personnel and agents in conjunction with
obtaining customer contra cts. We only defer these costs when we have determined the commissions are incremental costs that would not have been incurred absent the
customer contract and are expected to be recoverable . Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and recorded ratably as commission expense over the period representing the
transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. Costs to obtain wireless contracts are amortized over both of our Consumer and Business customers' estimated device
upgrade cycle s, as such costs are typically incurred each time a customer upgrades. Costs to obtain wireline contracts are amortized as expense over the estimated customer
relationship period for our Consumer customers. Incremental costs to obtain wireline contracts for our Business customers are insignificant. Costs to obtain contracts are
recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense.
We also defer costs incurr ed to fulfill contracts that: (1) relate directly to the contract; (2) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy our performance
obligation under the contract; and (3) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Contract fulfillment costs are expensed as we satisfy our
performance obligations and recorded to Cost of services. These costs principally relate to direct costs that enhance our wireline business resources, such as costs incurred to
install circuits.
We determine the amortization periods for our costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a customer contract at a portfolio level due to the similarities within these customer contract
portfolios.
Other costs, such as general costs or costs related to past performance obligations, are expensed as incurred.
Collectively , costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract are referred to as deferred contract costs, and amortized over a 2 to 5-year period. Deferred contract costs
are classified as current or non-current within Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets, respectively .
The balances of deferred contract costs included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:
At December  31,  At December 31,
(dollars in millions) 2019  2018
Assets    
Prepaid expenses and other $ 2,578  $ 2,083
Other assets 1,911 1,812
Total $ 4,489  $ 3,895
For the years ended December 31, 2019  and 2018 , we recogniz ed expense of $2.7 billion  and $2.0 billion , respectively , associated with the amortization of deferred contract
costs, primarily within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
We assess our deferred contract costs for impairment on a quarterly basis. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of a deferred cost exceeds the
remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods and services related to the cost, less the expected costs related directly to providing those
goods and services that have not yet been recognized as expenses. There have been no impairment char ges recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019  and 2018 .
Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures
Spectrum License Transactions
Since 2017 , we have entered into or completed several strategic spectrum transactions including:
• During the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T Inc. (AT&T) to exchange certain Advanced Wireless Services
(AWS) and Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in February 2017. As a result,  we received  $1.0 billion
of AWS and PCS spectrum  licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of $126 million  in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
• During the first quarter of 2017, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of Sprint Corporation to exchange certain PCS spectrum licenses. This
non-cash exch ange was completed in May 2017. As a result, we received $132 million  of PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded an insignificant gain in
Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
• During the third quarter of 2017, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of T-Mob ile USA Inc. to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum
licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in December 2017. As a result, we received  $414 million  of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and
recorded a pre-tax gain of  $143 million  in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
• During 2018,  we entered into and completed various  wireless license transactions, including the purchase of Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path) and
NextLink W ireless LLC ( NextLink ).
• During 2019, the FCC completed two millimeter wave spectrum  license auctions. Verizon  participated in these auctions and was the high bidder on 9 and 1,066
licenses, respectively , in the 24 Gigahertz (GHz) and 28 GHz bands. We submitted an application to the FCC and paid cash of approximately $521 million  for the
licenses. W e received the licenses during the fourth quarter of 2019.
• During 2019, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for an insignificant amount of cash consideration.
In December 2019, the FCC  incentive auction for spectrum licenses in the upper  37 GHz,  39 GHz, and  47 GHz bands commenced. As an incumbent licensee, Verizon received
vouchers related to our existing  39 GHz licenses. These vouchers can be converted into cash, the amount of which will not be known until the conclusion of the auction, or
applied toward the purchase price of spectrum in the auction. At the conclusion
of the auction, all existing licenses will be cancelled and new reconfigured licenses or cash will be distrib uted depending on the results of the auction. Due to the FCC's rules
restricting communications  regarding the auction, we will not disclose our financial plans for the auction during the quiet period for this auction unless legally required. In
addition, as of this time, until the completion of the auction process, we cannot determine the resulting financial outcome, including a potential gain or loss. Such gain or loss,
if any , may be material.
Acquisition of AOL Inc.
In May 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with AOL Inc. (AOL) pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares
of common stock of AOL at a price of  $50.00  per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary  of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the
closing of these transaction s was approximately  $3.8 billion . Holders of approximately  6.6 million  shares exercised appraisal rights under Delaware law. In September 2018,
we obtained court approva l to settle this matter for total cash consideration of $219 million  of which an insignificant amount relates to interest, resulting in an insignificant
gain. W e paid the cash consideration in October 2018.
XO Holdings
In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire  XO Holdings' wireline business  (XO), which owned and operated one of the largest fiber-based  Internet
Protocol and Ethernet networks in the U.S. Concurrently , we entered into a separate agreement to utilize certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO
Holdings,  NextLink, that held XO's millimeter -wave wireless spectrum. The agreement included an option, subject to certain  conditions, to acquire NextLink. In February
2017, we completed our acquisition of XO for total cash consideration of approximately  $1.5 billion , of which  $100 million  was paid in 2015, and we prepaid  $320 million  in
connection with the NextLink option which represented the fair value of the option.
In April 2017, we exercise d our option to buy NextL ink for approximately  $493 million , subject to certain adjustme nts, of which  $320 million  was prepaid in the first quarter
of 2017. The transaction closed in January 2018. The acquisition of NextLink was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired
spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded approximately  $657 million  of wireless licenses, $110 million  of a deferred tax liability and  $58 million  of other liabilities.
The consolidated financial statements include the results of XO's operations from the date the acquisition closed. If the acquisition of XO had been completed as of January 1,
2016, the results of operations of V erizon would not have been significantly dif ferent than our previously reported results of operations.
The acquisition of XO was accounted for as a busines s combination. The consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as
of the close of the acquisition. We recorded approximately $1.2 billion  of property , plant and equipment, $120 million  of goodwill and $194 million  of other intangible assets.
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill
represents future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition.
Acquisition of Yahoo! Inc.’s Operating Business
In July 2016, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoo’ s operating business for approximately  $4.83 billion
in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the T ransaction).
In February 2017, Verizon and Yahoo entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Transaction purchase price was reduced by $350 million  to
approximately  $4.48 billion  in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties also agreed that certain user security and data breaches incurred by
Yahoo (and the losses arising therefrom) were to be disregarded: (1) for purposes of specified condit ions to Verizon’ s obligations to close the Transaction; and (2) in
determining whether a "Business Material Adverse Ef fect" under the Purchase Agreement had occurred.
Concurrently with the amendment of the Purchase Agreement, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo that Verizon agreed to purchase pursuant
to the Transaction, also entered into an amendment to the related reorganization agreement, pursuant to which Yahoo (which changed its name to Altaba Inc. following the
closing of the Transaction) retains  50% of certa in post-closing liabilities arising out of governmental or third-party investigations, litigations or other claims related to certain
user security and data breaches incurred by Yahoo prior to its acquisition by Verizon, including an August 2013 data breach disclosed by Yahoo on December 14, 2016. At that
time, Yahoo disclosed that more than one billion of the approximately three billion accounts existing in 2013 had likely been affected. In accordance with the original
Transaction agreements, Yahoo will continue to retain  100%  of any liabili ties arising out of any shareholder lawsuits (including derivative claims) and investigation s and
actions by the SEC.
In June 2017, we complete d the Transaction. The aggregate purchase consideration at the closing of the Transaction was approximately  $4.7 billion , including cash acquired of
$230 million .
Prior to the closing of the Transaction, pursuant to a related reorganization agreement, Yahoo transferred all of the assets and liabilities constituting Yahoo’ s operating business
to the subsidiaries that we acquired in the Transactio n. The assets that we acquired did not include Yahoo’s ownership interests in Alibaba, Yahoo! Japan and certain other
investments, certain undeveloped land recently divested by Yahoo, certain non-core intellectual proper ty or its cash, other than the cash from its operating business we
acquired. We received for our benefit and that of our current and certain future affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to all of Yahoo’ s
intellectual property that was not conveyed with the business.
In October 2017, based upon information that we received in connection with our integration of Yahoo's operating business, we disclosed that we believe that the August 2013
data breach previously disclosed by Y ahoo af fected all of its accounts.
The acquisitio n of Yahoo’ s operating business has been accounted for as a business combination. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined
using the income, cost, market and multiple period excess earnings approaches. The fair value measuremen ts were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable
in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, other than long-term
debt assumed in the acquisition. The income approach was primarily used to value the intangible assets, consisting primarily of acquired technology and customer
relationships. The income approach indicates value for an asset based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flow is
discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flow and the time value of money . The cost approach, which estimates value by
determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility , was used, as appropriate, for property , plant and equipment. The cost to replace a
given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the property , less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation.
In June 2018, we finalized the accounting for the Yahoo acquisition. The following table summarizes the final accounting for the assets acquired, including cash acquired of
$230 million , and liabilities assumed as of the close of the acquisition, as well as the fair value at the acquisition date of Y ahoo’ s noncontrolling interests:
(dollars in millions) As of December 31, 2017Measur ement-period

(1) Adjustments to the fair value measurements to reflec t new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would
have af fected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. The most significant adjustments related to an increase in goodwill and the recognition of liabilities
per certain pre-acquisition contingencies.
On the closing date of the Transaction, each unvested and outstanding Yahoo restricted stock unit award that was held by an employee who became an employee of Verizon
was replaced with a Verizon restricted stock unit award, which is generally payable in cash upon the applicable vesting date. The value of those outstanding restricted stock
units on the acquisition date was approximately $1.0 billion .
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill was
primarily attributable to increased syner gies that were expected to be achieved from the integration of Yahoo’ s operating business into our Media business. The goodwill
related to this acquisition is included within Corporate and other .
The consolidated financial statements include the results of Yahoo’ s operating business from the date the acquisition closed. If the acquisition of Yahoo’ s operating business
had been completed as of January 1, 2016, the results of operations of V erizon would not have been significantly dif ferent than our previously reported results of operations.
Acquisition and Integration Related Charges
Related to the Yahoo Transaction, we recorded $473 million  of acquisition and integrat ion related charges during  the year ended December 31, 2018 , of which $273 million ,
$195 million  and an insign ificant amount are related to Severance, Integration costs and Transaction costs, respectively . In connection with the Yahoo Transaction, we recorded
acquisition and integration  related charges of approximately $762 million  during the year ended December 31, 2017 , of which $526 million , $166 million  and $70 million
related to Severance, Integ ration costs and Transacti on costs, respectively . These charges were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated
statements of income.
Data Center Sale
In December 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2017, with Equinix , Inc. (Equinix)  pursuant to which we agreed to sell
23 customer -facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America for approximately  $3.6 billion , subject to certain adjustments  (Data Center Sale)  . The transaction closed in
May 2017.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, these sites generated an insignificant amount of revenues and earnings.
In connection with the Data Center Sale and other insignificant divestitures, we recorded a net gain on sale of divested businesses of approximately $1.8 billion  in Selling,
general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Straight Path
In May 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Straight Path , a holde r of millimeter wave spectrum configured for fifth-generation (5G) wireless services, for
total consideration reflecting an enterprise value of approximately  $3.1 billion . Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we agreed to pay: (1) Straight Path shareholders
$184.00  per share, payable in Verizon shares; and (2) certain transaction costs payable in cash of approximately  $736 million , consisting primarily of a fee to be paid to the
FCC.  The transaction closed in February 2018 at which time we issued approximately  49 million shares of Verizon common stock, valued at approximately  $2.4 billion , and
paid the associated cash consideration.
The acquisiti on of Straight Path was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded
approximately $4.5 billion  of wireless licenses and $1.4 billion  of a deferred tax liability . The spectrum acquired as part of the transaction is being used for our 5G techn ology
deployment. See Note 4  for additional information.
WideOpenWest, Inc.
In August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreem ent to purchase certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from  WideOpenW est, Inc. (WOW! ), a leading
provider of communication s services. The transactio n closed in December 2017. In addition, the parties entered into a separate agreement pursuant to which WOW! was to
complete the build-out of the network assets in 2019. This build-out was completed in 2019. The total cash consideration for the transactions was approximately  $275 million ,
of which  $226 million  was paid in December 2017.  During 2019 and 2018, the remaining cash consideration was paid.
Other
In July 2019, Verizon completed a sale-leaseback transaction for buildings and real estate. See Note 6  for additional information related to the transaction. In connection with
this transaction and other insignificant transactions, we recorded a pre-tax net gain from dispositions  of assets and businesses of $261 million  in Selling, general and
administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2019 .
During 2019, 2018 and 2017, we completed various other acquisitions for an insignificant amount of cash consideration.
Note 4. Wireless Licenses, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Wireless Licenses
The carrying amounts of W ireless licenses are as follows:
 (dollars in millions)  
At December 31, 2019  2018
Wireless licenses $ 95,059  $ 94,130
At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , approximately $6.2 billion  and $8.6 billion , respec tively , of wireless licenses were under development for commercial service for which we
were capitalizing interest costs. We recorded approximately $321 million  and $515 million  of capitalized interest on wireless licenses for each of the years ended
December 31, 2019  and 2018 , respectively .
For the year ended December 31, 2018 , we recorded approximately $4.5 billion  of wireless licenses in connection with the Straight Path acquisition and $657 million  in
connection with the NextLink acquisition. See Note 3  for additional information regarding spectrum license transactions in 2019  and 2018 .
The average remaining renewal period of our wireless license portfolio was 4.6 years as of December 31, 2019 . See Note 1  for additional information.
As discussed in Note 1, we test our wireless licenses for potential impairm ent annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In 2019, we performed a
qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. In 2018, our quantitative
impairment test consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses estimated using the Greenfield approach to the aggregated carrying amount
of the license s as of the test date. In 2017 , we performe d a qualitative assessment to determine  whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses
was less than the carrying amount. Our assessments in 2019 , 2018  and 2017  indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, did
not result in impairment.
Goodwill
The Company  transitioned into our new reporting structure as of April 1, 2019, which resulted in certain changes to our operating segments and reporting units. Upon the date
of reorganization, the good will of our historical Wireless reporting unit, historical Wireline reporting unit and historical Verizon Connect reporting unit were reallocated to our
new Consumer and Business reporting units using a relative fair value approach.
Changes in the carrying amount of Goodwill are as follows:

(1) Represents the reallocation of goodwill as a result of the Company reor ganizing its segments as described in Note 1.
(2) Goodwill is net of accumulated impairment char ges of $4.6 billion  as of December 31, 2018 and $4.8 billion  as of December 31, 2019, related to our Media reporting unit.
We performe d impairment assessments of the impacted reporting units, specifically our historical Wireless, historical Wireline and historical Connect reporting units on
March 31, 2019, immediate ly before our strategic reorganization became effective. Our impairment assessm ents indicated that the fair value for each of our historical Wireless,
historical Wireline and historical Connect reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values, and therefore did not result in a goodwill impairment. We then performed
quantitative assessments of our Consumer and Busin ess reporting units on April 1, 2019, immediately following our strategic reorganization. Our impairment assessments
indicated that the fair value for each of our Consum er and Business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore, did not result in a goodwill
impairment. Our Media reporting unit was not impacted by the strategic reor ganization and there was no indicator of impairment as of the reor ganization date.
We performed qualitative impairment assessments for our Consumer and Business reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2019. Our qualitative assessments indicated that
it was more likely than not that the fair values for our Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and, therefore, did not result in an
impairment. We performed  quantitative impairment assessments for our Media reporting unit in 2019 and 2018. For details on our Media reporting unit, refer to the discussion
below .
Our Media business, Verizon Media, experienced increased competitive and market pressures throughout 2018 that resulted in lower than expected revenues and earnings.
These pressures were expe cted to continue and have resulted in a loss of market positioning to our comp etitors in the digital advertising business. Our Media business also
achieved lower than expected benefits from the integration of the Y ahoo  and AOL  businesses.
In connection with Verizon’ s annual budget process during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, the leadership at both Verizon Media and Verizon completed a comprehensive
five-year strategic planning review of Verizon Media's business prospects resulting in unfavorable adjustments to Verizon Media's financial projections. These revised
projections were used as a key input into V erizon Media's annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018.
During the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, consis tent with our accounting policy , we applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method
reflecting current assumpti ons and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which resulted in the determination that the fair value of
the Media reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately  $186 million  ($176 million  after-
tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a charge of $4.6 billion  ($4.5 billion  after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2018 in our conso lidated statements of income.  The goodwill
balance of the Media reporting unit  has been fully written of f as a result of these impairment char ges.
We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for all of the other reporting units in 2018. Our impairment tests indicated that the fair value for each of our historical
Wireless, historical W ireline and historical Connect reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
For 2017, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for all of our reporting units, except for our historical Wireless reporting unit, for which a qualitative assessment
was complete d. For 2017, our impairment tests indica ted that the fair value for each of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value and therefore, did not result
in goodwill impairment.

Note 6. Leasing Arrangements
We enter into various lease arrangements for network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate and connectivity mediums including
dark fiber , equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations. Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year  to 28 years , some of which include
options that we can elect to extend the leases term for up to 25 years , and some of which include options to terminate the leases. For the majority of leases entered into during
the current period, we have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend the lease or terminate the lease. Therefore, as of the lease
commencement date, our lease terms generally do not include these options. We include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that
option.
During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to
lease and operate approximately 11,300  of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion . We have subleased capacit y on the towers from American Tower for a
minimum of 10 years  at current market rates in 2015, with options to renew. We continue to include the towers in Property , plant and equipment , net in our consolidated
balance sheet s and depreciate them accordingly . In addition to the rights to lease and operate the towers, American Tower assumed the interest in the underlying ground leases
related to these towers. While American Tower can renegotiate the terms of and is responsible for paying the ground leases, we are still the primary obligor for these leases and
accordingly , the present value of these ground leases are included in our operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. We do not expect to be required to
make ground lease payments unless American T ower defaults, which we determined to be remote.

operating leases that have not yet commenced. We have legally obligated lease payments for various other operating leases that have not yet commenced for which the total
obligation was not significant. We have certain rights and obligations for these leases, but have not recognized an operating lease right-of-use asset or an operating lease
liability since they have not yet commenced.
Real Estate Transaction
On July 23, 2019, Verizon completed a sale-leaseback  transaction for buildings and real estate. We received total gross proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion . We leased back
a portion of the buildings and real estate sold and accounted for it as an operating lease. The term of the leaseback is for two years  with four options to renew for an additional
three months  each. The proceeds receiv ed as a result of this transaction have been classified in Other , net within Cash Flows from Investing Activities in our consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net gain as a result of this transaction is included in the components of net lease cost table above.

(1) Net proceeds were net of discount and issuance costs.
(2) An amount equal to the net proceeds from this green  bond will be used to fund, in whole or in part, "Eligible Green Investments." "Eligible Green Investments" include new
and existing investments made by us during the period from two years prior to the issuance of the green bond through the maturity date of the green bond, in the following
categories: (1) renewable ener gy; (2) ener gy ef ficiency; (3) green buildings; (4) sustainable water management; and (5) biodiversity and conservation.
Short-Term Borrowing and Commercial Paper Program
In July 2018 , we entered into a short-term uncommitted credit facility with the ability to borrow up to $700 million . As of December 31, 2019  and 2018, there was no
outstanding balance.
As of December 31, 2019  and 2018 , we had no commercial paper outstanding.
Asset-Backed Debt
As of December 31, 2019 , the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $12.4 billion . Our asset-backed debt includes Asset-Backed Notes (ABS Notes) issued to third-party
investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facilities) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively , the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt
bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively , the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in connection
with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, Cellco Partnership  (Cellco) and certain other affiliates of Verizon (collectively , the
Originators) transfer device payment plan agreement receivables to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt.
Verizon entiti es retain the equity interests in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other
related payments and expenses.
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. The device payment plan agreement
receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-backed debt and expenses
related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed
debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’ s creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied.
The Investors or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do not have any recourse to Verizon with
respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, V erizon has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco and
the Originators to the ABS Entities.
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreem ent receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be placed into
segregated accounts. Depo sits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other , and Other assets in our consolidated
balance sheets.
Proceeds from our asset-b acked debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt
issued and the assets securing this debt are included in our consolidated balance sheets.

(1) The one-month LIBOR at December 31, 2019  was 1.763% .
Under the terms of each series of ABS Notes, there is a two year revolving period during which we may transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entity . In April, July and
November 2019, the two year revolving period of the ABS Notes we issued in March, June and October 2017, respectively , ended, and we began to repay principal on the
2017-1, 2017-2 and 2017-3 Class A senior ABS Notes. In October 2019, in connection with an optional acquisition of receivables and redemption of 2016-1 Notes, we made a
principal payment, in whole, for an insignificant amount. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we made aggregate principal repayments of $3.3 billion , for all ABS
Notes.
In January 2020, we issued $1.6 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior and junior Asset-Backed Notes through an ABS Entity .
ABS Financing Facility
In May 2018, we entered into an ABS financing facility with a number of financial institutions (2018 ABS Financing Facility). One loan agreement was entered into in
connection with the 2018 ABS Financing Facility . In May 2019, the $540 million  outstanding under the loan agreement was prepaid, and the loan agreement was terminated.
In September  2016, we entered into an ABS financing facility with a number of financial institutions (2016 ABS Financing Facility). Two loan agreements were entered into in
connection with the 2016 ABS Financing Facility in September 2016 and May 2017. In April and May 2019, we paid off both the 2016 and 2017 loans for an aggregate of
$671 million , and the loan agreements were terminated .
In May 2019, the 2016 ABS Financing Facility was amended and restated (2019 ABS Financing Facility ). Under the terms of the 2019 ABS Financing Facility , which is an
uncommitted facility , the financial institutions make advances under asset-backed loans backed by device payment plan agreement receivables of both consumer and business
customers. One loan agreement was entered into in connection with the 2019 ABS Financing Facility . The 2019 loan agreement has a final maturity date in May 2023 and
bears interest at floating rates.  There is a one year  revolving period until May 2020, which may be extended with the approval of the financial institutions. Under the 2019 loan
agreement, we have the right to prepay all or a portion of the advances at any time without penalty , but in certain cases, with breakage costs. Subject to certain conditions, we
may also remove receivabl es from the ABS Entity . In May 2019, we borrowed $1.8 billion  under the 2019 loan agreement. In August 2019, we prepaid $1.5 billion  of the loan
made in May 2019 under the 2019 loan agreement.  In November 2019, we borrowed an additional $1.5 billion  under the 2019 loan agreement. In December 2019, the 2019
loan agreement was amended to increase the facility by an additional $1.5 billion , and an additional $1.5 billion  was borrowed under the 2019 loan agreement. The aggregate
outstanding balance under the 2019 ABS Financing Facility was  $3.3 billion  as of December 31, 2019 . In January 2020, we prepaid $1.3 billion  of the loan under the 2019 loan
agreement.
Variable Inter est Entities
The ABS Entities meet the definition of a VIE for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary as we have both the power to direct the activities of the entity
that most significantly impact the entity’ s performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity . Therefore, the assets, liabilities and
activities of the ABS Entities are consolidated in our financial results and are included in amounts presented on the face of our consolidated balance sheets.
The assets and liabilities related to our asset-backed debt arrangements included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:
 At December 31,  At December 31,
(dollars in millions) 2019  2018

Total   $ 15,000  $ 9,390  $ 4,471
(1) The revolvin g credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified  credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has
incurred a material adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit.
(2) During 2019 and 2018, we drew down $1.5 billion  and $3.0 billion  from these facilities, respectively . We use these credit facilities to finance equipment-related purchases.
Non-Cash Transaction
During the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , we financed, primarily through vendor financing arrangements, the purchase of approximately $563 million , $1.1
billion , and $501 million , respectively , of long-live d assets consisting primari ly of network equipment. At both December 31, 2019  and 2018 , $1.1 billion  relating to these
financing arrangements, including those entered into in prior years and liabilities assumed through acquisitions, remained outstanding. These purchases are non-cash financing
activities and therefore are not reflected within Capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Early Debt Redemptions
During 2019 , 2018  and 2017, we recorded losses on early debt redemptions of $3.7 billion , $681 million , and $2.0 billion , respectively .
We recognize losses on early debt redemptions in Other income (expense), net, in our consolidated statements of income. The total losses are reflected as an adjustment to
reconcile net income to Net cash used in operating activities and the portion of the losses representing cash payments are reflected within Net cash used in financing activities
in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Guarantees
We guarantee the debentu res of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2019 , $765 million  aggregate principal amount of these obligations
remained outstanding. Each guarantee will remain in place for the life of the obligation unless terminated pursuant to its terms, including the operating telephone company no
longer being a wholly-owned subsidiary of V erizon.
We also guarantee the debt obligations of GTE LLC as successor in interest to GTE Corporation  that were issued and outstanding prior to July 1, 2003. As of
December 31, 2019 , $391 million  aggregate principal amount of these obligations remain outstanding.
Debt Covenants
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.
Note 8. Wireless Device Payment Plans
Under the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement. Customers that activate service
on devices purchased unde r the device payment program pay lower service fees as compared to those unde r our fixed-term service plans, and their device payment plan charge
is included on their wirele ss monthly bill. As of January 2017, we no longer offer Consumer customers new fixed-term, subsidized service plans for phones; however , we
continue to offer subsidized plans to our Business customers. We also continue to service existing plans for customers who have not yet purchased and activated devices under
the V erizon device payment program.
Wireless Device Payment Plan Agreement Receivables

Other assets 5,522  5,546
Device payment plan agr eement r eceivables, net $ 18,567  $ 18,170
Included in our device payment plan agreement receivables, net at December 31, 2019  and December 31, 2018 , are net device payment plan agreement receivables  of $14.3
billion  and $11.5 billion , respectively , which have been transferred to ABS Entities and continue to be reported in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7  for additional
information. W e believe the carrying value of our installment loans receivables approximate their fair value using a Level 3 expected cash flow model.
We may offer certain prom otions that allow a customer to trade in their owned device in connection with the purchase of a new device. Under these types of promotions, the
customer receives a credit  for the value of the trade-in device. In addition, we may provide the customer with additional future credits that will be applied against the
customer ’s monthly bill as long as service is maintained. We recognize a liability for the customer's right to trade-in the device measured at fair value, which is determined by
considering several factors , including the weighted-av erage selling prices obtained in recent resales of similar devices eligible for trade-in. Future credits are recognized when
earned by the customer . Device payment plan agreement receivables, net does not reflect the trade-in device liability . At December 31, 2019  and December 31, 2018 , the
amount of trade-in liability was $103 million  and $64 million , respectively .
From time to time, we offer certain marketing promotions that allow our customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down a certain specified portion of the required
device payment plan agreement amount, as well as trading in their device in good working order . When a customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right
to upgrade to a new device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation.
For indirect channel wirele ss contracts with customer s, we impute risk adjusted interest on the device payment plan agreement receivables. We record the imputed interest as a
reduction to the related accounts receivable. Interest income, which is included within Service revenues and
other in our consolidated statements of income, is recognized over the financed device payment term. See Note 2  for additional information  on financing consideratio ns with
respect to wireless direct channel contracts with customers.
When originating device payment plan agreements for Consumer customers, we use internal and external data sources to create a credit risk score to measure the credit quality
of a customer and to determ ine eligibility for the device payment program. If a customer is either new to Verizon or has 45 days or less of customer tenure with Verizon, the
credit decision process relies more heavily on external data sources. If the customer has more than 45 days  of customer tenure with Verizon (an existing customer), the credit
decision process relies on a combination of internal and external data sources. External data sources include obtaining a credit report from a national consumer credit reporting
agency , if available. Verizon uses its internal data and/or credit data obtained from the credit reporting agencies to create a custom credit risk score. The custom credit risk
score is generated automatically (except with respect to a small number of applications where the information needs manual intervention) from the applicant’ s credit data using
Verizon’ s proprietary custom credit models, which are empirically derived and demonstrably and statistically sound. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that the
potential customer will become severely delinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of new customer applications, a traditional credit report is not
available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient credit history . In those instances, alternate credit data is
used for the risk assessment.
Based on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer to a credit class, each of which has specified offers of credit including an account level spending limit and
either a maximum amount  of credit allowed per device or a required down payment percentage. During the fourth quarter of 2018, Verizon moved all Consumer customers,
new and existing, from a required down payment percentage, between zero and 100% , to a maximum amount of credit per device.
Subsequent to origination,  Verizon monitors delinqu ency and write-of f experience as key credit quality indicators for its portfolio of device payment plan agreements and
fixed-term service plans. The extent of our collection efforts with respect to a particular customer are based on the results of proprietary custom empirically derived internal
behavioral scoring models that analyze the customer ’s past performance to predict the likelihood of the customer falling further delinquent. These customer scoring models
assess a number of variables, including origination characteristics, customer account history and payment patterns. Based on the score derived from these models, accounts are
grouped by risk category to determine the collection strategy to be applied to such accounts. We continuo usly monitor collection performance results and the credit quality of
our device payment plan agreement receivables based on a variety of metrics, including aging. Verizon considers an account to be delinquent and in default status if there are
unpaid char ges remaining on the account on the day after the bill’ s due date.
The balance and aging of the device payment plan agreement receivables on a gross basis were as follows:

Sales of Wireless Device Payment Plan Agreement Receivables
In 2015 and 2016, we established programs pursuant to a Receivables Purchase Agreement (RPA) to sell from time to time, on an uncommitted basis, eligible device payment
plan agreement receivables to a group of primarily  relationship banks (Purchasers) on both a revolving and non-revolving basis, collectively the Programs. Under the
Programs, eligible device payment plan agreement receivables were transferred to the Purchasers for upfront cash proceeds and additional consideration upon settlement of the
receivables, referred to as the deferred purchase price. In December 2017, the RPA and all other related transaction documents were terminated and as of December 31, 2017
we had no further continuing involvement with any of the receivables sold under the RP A program.
There were no sales of device payment plan agreement receivables under the Programs during 2017.
Deferr ed Pur chase Price
Collections of deferred purchase price were $1.4 billion  during 2017. During 2017, we repurchased all outstanding receivables previously sold to the Purchasers in exchange
for the obligation to pay the associated deferred purchase price to the wholly-owned subsidiaries that were bankruptcy remote special purpose entities (Sellers). At
December 31, 2017, our deferred purchase price receivable was fully satisfied. Collections
following the repurchase of receivables were insignificant , $195 million  and $238 million  during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively . Collections of both deferred purchase
price and repurchased receivables were recorded in Cash flows used in investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

(2) Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
(3) Unobservable pricing inputs in the market
Certain of our equity investments do not have readily determinable fair values and are excluded from the tables above. Such investments are measured at cost, less any
impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer and are included in
Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2019  and December 31, 2018 , the carrying  amount of our investments
without readi ly determinab le fair values was $284 million  and $248 million , respectively . During 2019 , there were insignificant adjustments due to observa ble price changes
and we recognized an insignificant impairment char ge. Cumulative adjustments due to observable price changes and impairment char ges were insignificant.
Fixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds. For fixed income securities that do not have quoted prices in active markets, we use alternative
matrix pricing resulting in these debt securities being classified as Level 2.
Derivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substa ntial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified within
Level 2. W e use mid-market pricing for fair value measurements of our derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments are recorded on a gross basis.
We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2019  and
2018 .
Fair V alue of Short-term and Long-term Debt
The fair value  of our debt is determined using variou s methods, including quoted prices for identical terms and maturities, which is a Level 1 measurement, as well as quoted
prices for similar terms and maturities in inactive markets and future cash flows discounted at current rates, which are Level 2 measurements. The fair value of our short-term
and long-term debt, excluding finance leases, was as follows:

Derivative Instruments
The following table sets forth the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments:
   (dollars in millions)
At December 31, 2019  2018
Interest rate swaps $ 17,004  $ 19,813
Cross currency swaps 23,070  16,638
Forward starting interest rate swaps 3,000  4,000
Interest rate caps 679  2,218
Foreign exchange forwards 1,130  600
Inter est Rate Swaps
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates that are currently based on
LIBOR, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges  and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of designated
debt issuances.  We record the interest rate swaps at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are
recorded to Interest expense, which are of fset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt due to changes in interest rates.
During 2019 , we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $510 million  and settled interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $3.3 billion . During
2018 , we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $730 million  and settled interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $1.1 billion .
The inef fective portion of these interest rate swaps was $54 million  and insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2019  and 2018 , respectively .
The following amounts were recorded in Long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges:
 (dollars in millions)  
At December 31, 2019  2018
Carrying amount of hedged liabilities $ 17,337  $ 18,903
Cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the hedged liabilities 433  (785)
Cross Curr ency Swaps
We have entered into cross currency swaps designate d as cash flow hedges to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc and Australian Dollar -denominated cash
flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses.
During 2019 , we entered into cross currency swaps with a total notional value of $6.4 billion  and did not settle any cross currency swaps. A pre-t ax loss of $385 million  was
recognized in Other comprehensive loss  with respect to these swaps.
During 2018 , we did not enter into or settle any cross currency swaps. A pre-tax loss of $720 million  was recognized in Other comprehensive loss  with respect to these swaps.
A portion of the losses recognized in Other comprehensive loss  was reclassified to Other income (expense), net  to offset the related pre-tax foreign currency transact ion gain or
loss on the underlying hedged item.
Forward Starting Inter est Rate Swaps
We have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our exposure to interest rate changes on future forecasted
transactions.
During 2019 , we did not enter into any forward starting interest rate swaps and we settled forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $1.0 billion . A pre-
tax loss of $565 million , resulting from interest rate movements was recognized in Other comprehensive loss  with respect to these swaps.
During 2018 , we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $4.0 billion . A pre-tax loss of $60 million  was recognized in Other
comprehensive loss  with respect to these swaps.
We hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows of based on the expected maturities of the related forecasted debt issuance.
Net Investment Hedges
We have designated certain foreign currency instrum ents as net investment hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S. dollar net investments in certain
foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exch ange rates. The notional amount of the Euro-denominated debt as a net investment hedge was €750 million  as of both
December 31, 2019  and 2018 , respectively .
Undesignated Derivatives
We also have the following derivative contracts which we use as economic hedges but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting.
Inter est Rate Caps
We enter into interest rate caps to mitigate our interest exposure to interest rate increases on our ABS Financing Facility and ABS Notes.  Durin g both 2019 and 2018, we
recognized an insignificant amount in Interest expense related to interest rate caps.
Foreign Exchange Forwards
We enter into British Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchang e rate risk related to non-functional currency denominated monetary
assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries.  During 2019 , we entered into foreign exchange forwards with a total notional value of $12.0 billion  and settled foreign
exchange forwards with a total notional value of $11.5 billion . During 2018 , we entered into foreign exchange forwards with a total notional value of $2.8 billion  and settled
foreign exchange forwards with a total notional value  of $2.2 billion . During 2019 and 2018, a pre-tax loss of insignificant amount was recognized in Other income (expense),
net.
Treasury Rate Locks
During 2019 , we entered into treasury rate locks with a total notional value of $1.5 billion  to hedge the tender of fers conducted in May 2019 for fifteen  series of notes issued by
Verizon with coupon rates ranging from 4.672%  to 5.012%  and maturity  dates ranging from 2054 to 2055 (May  Tender offers). In addition, we entered into treasury rate locks
with a total notional value  of $1.5 billion  to hedge the tender offers conducted in November and December 2019 for eleven  and twenty  series of notes and debentures,
respectively , issued by Verizon and other subsidiari es with coupon rates ranging from 3.850%  to 8.950%  and maturity dates rangin g from 2021 to 2055 (November and
December Tender offers). Upon the early settlement of the May, November and December Tender Offers, we settled these hedges and recognized an insignificant gain in Other
income (expense), net .
During 2018 , we entered into treasury rate locks with a total notional value of $2.0 billion  to hedge the tender offers conducted in September 2018 for eight  series of notes
issued by Verizon with coupon rates ranging from 3.850%  to 5.012%  and maturity dates ranging from 2039 to 2055 (September Tender Offers). Upon the early settlement of
the September T ender Of fers, we settled these hedges and recognized an insignificant loss in Other income (expense), net .
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, short-term and long-term investments, trade receivables,
including device payment plan agreement receivables, certain notes receivable, including lease receivables, and derivative contracts.
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support
annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. Negotiations and executions of new ISDA master agreements and CSA agreements with our
counterparties continued during 2018. The CSA agreements contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based
upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. At December 31, 2019 , we held an insignificant amount and at
December 31, 2018 , we posted approximately $0.1 billion  of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded  as Other
current liabilities and Prepaid expenses and other , respectively , in our consolidated balance sheets. While we may be exposed to credit
losses due to the nonperfor mance of our counterpartie s, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our
results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties.
Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation
Verizon Long-Term Incentive Plan
In May 2017, Verizon’ s shareholders approved the 2017 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated Verizon's authority to grant new awards under the Verizon
2009 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of
stock options, stock apprec iation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, perform ance stock units and other awards. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan,
Verizon reserved for issuan ce under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were remaining but not issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the
2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2019 , 89 million  shares are reserved for
future issuance under the 2017 Plan.
Restricted Stock Units
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three  equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock
upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting
period. The RSUs that are settled in cash are classifi ed as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs granted
under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units, which will be paid to participants at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award.
In February 2018, Verizon announced a broad-based employee special award of RSUs under the 2017 Plan to eligible full-time and part-time employees. These RSUs are
vested in two equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date and paid in cash. The first installment of the restricted stock units was vested and paid in February 2019
and the remaining restricted stock units will be vested and paid in February 2020.
In connection  with our acquisition of Yahoo’ s operati ng business, on the closing date of the Transaction each unvested and outstanding Yahoo RSU award that was held by an
employee who became an employee of Verizon was replaced with a Verizon RSU award, which is generall y payable in cash upon the applicable vesting date. These awards are
classified as liability awards and are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period.
We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise  those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate
forfeitures and recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Performance Stock Units
The 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As defined by the 2017 Plan, the
Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directo rs determines the number of PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals
have been achieved over the three -year perform ance cycle. The PSUs are classified as liability awards because the PSU awards are paid in cash upon vesting. The PSU award
liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of Verizon common stock as well as performance
relative to the targets. All PSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units, which will be paid to participants at the time that PSU award is determined and
paid, and in the same proportion as the PSU award. The granted and cancelled activity for the PSU award includes adjustments for the performance goals achieved.
The following table summarizes V erizon’ s Restricted Stock Unit and Performance Stock Unit activity:

As of December 31, 2019 , unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of V erizon’ s RSUs and PSUs was approximately $765 million  and is expected to
be recognized over approximately two years .
The equity RSUs granted in 2019  and 2018  have weighted-average grant date fair values of $56.66  and $49.19  per unit, respectively . During 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , we paid
$737 million , $773 million  and $750 million , respectively , to settle RSUs and PSUs classified as liability awards.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
After -tax compensation expense for stock-based compensation related to RSUs and PSUs described above included in Net income attributable to Verizon was $872 million ,
$720 million  and $384 million  for 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectively .
Note 11. Employee Benefits
We maintain non-contributory defined benefit pension plans for certain employees. In addition, we main tain postretirement health care and life insurance plans for certain
retirees and their dependents, which are both contributory and non-contributory , and include a limit on our share of the cost for certain current and future retirees. In accordance
with our accounting policy  for pension and other postretirement benefits, operating expenses include service costs associated with pension and other postretirement benefits
while other credits and/or char ges based on actuarial assumptions, including projected discount rates, an estimated return on plan assets, and impact from health care trend rates
are reported in Other income (expense), net. These estimates are updated in the fourth quarter to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions or upon a
remeasurement. The adjustment is recognized in the income statement during the fourth quarter or upon a remeasurement event pursuant to our accounting policy for the
recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
Pension and other postretirement benefits for certain  employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Modifications in benefits have been bargained from time to
time, and we may also periodically amend the benefi ts in the management plans. The following tables summarize benefit costs, as well as the benefit obligations, plan assets,
funded status and rate assumptions associated with pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $21.2 billion  and $19.5 billion  at December 31, 2019  and 2018 , respectively .
2018 Collective Bargaining Negotiations
The extension agreement ratified in August 2018 extended our collective bargaining agreements with the Communications Workers of America and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers that were due to expire on August 3, 2019 for four years  until August  5, 2023. Amendments triggered by the collective bargaining
negotiations were made to certain pension plans for certain union-represented employees and retirees. The impact of the plan amendments was an increase in our defined
benefit pension plans plan obligations and a net decrease to Accumulated other comprehensive income  of $230 million  (net of taxes of $170 million ). The annual impact of the
amount recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income  that will be reclassified to net periodic benefit cost is insignificant.
2017 Postretirement Plan Amendments
During 2017, amendments were made to certain postr etirement plans related to retiree medical benefits for management and certain union-represented employees and retirees. 
The impact of the plan amendments was a reduction in our postretirement benefit plan obligations of appro ximately $527 million , which has been recorded as a net increase to
Accumulated other comprehensive income of $317 million  (net of taxes  of $210 million ).  The impac t of the amou nt recorded in Accumulat ed other comprehensive income
that will be reclassified to net periodic benefit cost is insignificant. 
2016 Collective Bargaining Negotiations
During 2016, we adopted changes to our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to reflect the agreed upon terms and conditions of the collective
bargaining agreements ratified in June 2016. The impact includes a net increase to Accumulated other comprehensive income of $2.9 billion  (net of taxes of $1.8 billion ). The
amount record ed in Accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to net periodic benefit cost on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period
of the respective plans’ participants, which, on a weighted-average basis, is 12.2 years  for defined benefit pension plans and 7.8 years  for other postretirement benefit plans.
The above-noted reclassification resulted in a decrease to net periodic benefit cost and increase to pre-tax income of approximately $658 million  during  2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively .

The estimated  prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over
the next fiscal year is $61 million . The estimate d prior service cost for the defined benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive
income into net periodic benefit income over the next fiscal year is $1.0 billion .
Assumptions
The weighted-average assumptions used in determining benefit obligations follow:
 Pension   Health Car e and Life  
At December 31, 2019  2018  2019  2018
Discount Rate 3.30% 4.40% 3.20% 4.30%
Rate of compensation increases 3.00  3.00  N/A  N/A
The weighted-average assumptions used in determining net periodic cost follow:
 Pension   Health Car e and Life  
At December 31, 2019  2018  2017  2019  2018  2017
Discount rate in ef fect for determining service cost 4.60% 4.10% 4.70% 4.60% 3.90% 4.60%
Discount rate in ef fect for determining interest cost 3.80  3.40  3.40  4.00  3.20  3.50
Expected return on plan assets 6.80  7.00  7.70  4.30  4.80  4.50
Rate of compensation increases 3.00  3.00  3.00  N/A  N/A  N/A
In determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 3.3%  in 2019 . The rates were selected to approximate the
composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2019 . The bonds selected had maturities that coincided with the
time periods during which  benefits payments are expected to occur , were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $300 million  par
outstanding).
In order to project the long-term target investment return for the total portfolio, estimates are prepared for the total return of each major asset class over the subsequent 10-year
period. Those  estimates are based on a combination of factors including the current market interest rates and valuation levels, consensus earnings expectations and historical
long-term risk premiums. To determine the aggregate return for the pension trust, the projected return of each individual asset class is then weighted according to the allocation
to that investment area in the trust’ s long-term asset allocation policy .
The assumed health care cost trend rates are as follows:
 Health Car e and Life  
At December 31, 2019  2018  2017
Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.10% 6.30% 7.00%
Rate to which cost trend rate gradually declines 4.50  4.50  4.50
Year the rate reaches the level it is assumed to remain thereafter 2027  2027  2026
A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following ef fects:
 (dollars in millions)  
One-Percentage Point Increase  Decr ease
Effect on 2019 service and interest cost $ 20 $ (21)
Effect on postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 626  (696)
Plan Assets
The Company’ s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return.
While target allocation percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for plan assets is desig ned so that 48% to 68% of the assets have the objective of achieving
a return in excess of the growth in liabilities (compr ised of public equities, private equities, real estate, hedge funds and emer ging debt) and 35% to 55% of the assets are
invested as liability hedging assets (where cash flows from investments better match projected benefit payments, typically longer duration fixed income) and a maximum of
15% is in cash. This allocation will shift as funded status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target policies will be revisited periodically to ensure they
are in line with fund objectives. Both active and passive management approaches are used depending on perceived market efficiencies and various other factors. Due to our
diversification and risk control processes, there are no significant concentrations of risk, in terms of sector , industry , geography or company names.
Pension and healthcare and life plans assets do not include significant amounts of V erizon common stock.

The following are general descriptions of asset categories, as well as the valuation methodologies and inputs used to determine the fair value of each major category of assets.
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds (less than 90 days to maturity), prim arily in diversified portfolios of investment grade money market
instruments and are valued using quoted market prices or other valuation methods. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature
of these investments.
Investments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or , if no
sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds , international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix
prices with input from independent third-party valuation sources. Over -the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last
business day of the year from published sources or , if not available, from other sources considered reliable such as multiple broker quotes.
Commingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value (NAV). Commingled funds held by third-party
custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. The fund managers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian
of the respective plan.
The investme nt manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource limited partnership investments. Real estate investments are valued at
amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real estate appraisers or the investment manager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data.
Loans secured  by mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned to these investments are based
upon available and current  market information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultim ately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation,
estimated fair values might dif fer significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These dif ferences could be material.
Forward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on the last business day of the year . Both exchange
rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These securities are classified by the asset class of the underlying holdings.
Hedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on statements received from the investment manager . These funds are valued in accordance with the terms of their
corresponding of fering or private placement memoranda.
Commingled funds, hedge funds, venture capital, corporate finance, natural resource and real estate limite d partnership investments for which fair value is measured using the
NAV per share as a practical expedient are not leveled within the fair value hierarchy and are included as a reconciling item to total investments.
Employer Contributions
In 2019 , we made a $300 million  discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plans, $71 million  of contributio ns to our nonqualified pension plans and $449 million  of
contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans. No qualified pension plans contributions are expected to be made in 2020. Nonqualified pension plans contributions are
estimated to be approximately $70 million  and contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $700 million  in 2020 .
Estimated Future Benefit Payments
The benefit payments to retirees are expected to be paid as follows:
   (dollars in millions)
Year Pension Benefits  Health Car e and Life
2020 $ 2,227  $ 961
2021 1,680  947
2022 1,620  930
2023 1,577  968
2024 1,072  951
2025 to 2029 5,248  4,569
Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plans
We maintain four leveraged  employee stock ownersh ip plans (ESOP). We match a certain percentage of eligible employee contributions to certain savings plans with shares of
our common stock from this ESOP . At December 31, 2019 , the number of allocated shares of common stock in this ESOP was 49 million . There were no unallocated shares of
common stock in this ESOP at December 31, 2019 . All leveraged ESOP shares are included in earnings per share computations.
Total savings plan costs were $897 million  in 2019 , $1.1 billion  in 2018  and $838 million  in 2017 .
Severance Benefits
The following table provides an analysis of our severance liability:
       (dollars in millions)  
Year Beginning of Y ear  Charged to
Expense  Payments  Other  End of Year
2017 $ 656  $ 581  $ (564) $ (46) $ 627
2018 627  2,093  (560) (4) 2,156
2019 2,156  260  (1,847 ) (4) 565
Severance, Pension and Benefits (Cr edits) Charges
During 2019 , in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur , we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits
charges of $126 million  in our pension and postreti rement benefit plans. The charges were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income
and were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from
a weighted-average of 4.4%  at December 31, 2018 to a weighted-average of 3.3%  at December 31, 2019 ($4.3 billion ), partially offset by the difference between our estimated
return on assets and our actual return on assets ($2.3 billion ) and other assumption adjustments of $1.9 billion , of which $1.6 billion  related to healthcare claims experience.
During 2019, we also recorded net pre-tax severance char ges of  $260 million  in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
During 2018,  we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $2.1 billion  in accordanc e with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period
in whic h they occur . The pension and benefits remeasurement credits of $2.3 billion , which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of
income, were primarily driven by an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans
from a weighted-average of 3.7%  at December 31, 2017 to a weighted-average of 4.4%  at December 31, 2018 ( $2.6 billion ), and mortality and other assumption adjustments of
$1.7 billion , $1.6 billion  of which related to health care claims and trend adjustments, offset by the difference between our estima ted return on assets of 7.0%  and our actual
return on assets of (2.7)%  ($1.9 billion ). The credits were partially of fset by $177 million  due to the ef fect of participants retiring under the V oluntary Separation Program.
In September 2018, Verizon announced a Voluntary Separation Program for select U.S.-based managem ent employees. Approximately  10,400  eligible employees separated
from the Company under this program as of the end of June 2019. The severance benefit payments to these employees were substantially completed by the end of September
2019. Principally as a result of this program but also as a result of other headcount reduction initiatives, the Company recorded a severance charge of $1.8 billion  ($1.4 billion
after-tax) during the year ended December 31, 2018, which was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income. During 2018,
we also recorded  $339 million  in severance costs under our other existing separation plans.
During 2017,  we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefits charges of $1.4 billion , exclusive of acquisition related severance charges, in accordance with our
accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur . The pension and benefits remeasurement charges of approximately $911 million ,
which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our conso lidated statem ents of income, were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to
determine the current year liabilities of our pension and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 4.2%  at December 31, 2016 to a weighted-average of 3.7%  at
December 31, 2017 ( $2.6 billion ). The char ges were partially of fset by the dif ference between our estimated return on assets of 7.0%  and our actual return on assets
of 14.0%  ($1.2 billion ), a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2017) issued by the Society of Actuaries ($227 million )
and other assumption adjustments ($320 million ). As part of these charges, we also recorded severance costs of $497 million  under our existing separation plans, which were
recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income.
Note 12. Taxes
The components of income before provision (benefit) for income taxes are as follows:
 (dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31, 2019  2018  2017

Total 1,232  389  (14,463 )
Total income tax pr ovision (benefit) $ 2,945  $ 3,584  $ (9,956 )
The following table shows the principal reasons for the dif ference between the ef fective income tax rate and the statutory federal income tax rate:
Years Ended December 31, 2019  2018  2017
Statutory federal income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 35.0 %
State and local income tax rate, net of federal tax benefits 3.7  3.7  1.6
Preferred stock disposition (9.9) —  —
Affordable housing credit (0.4) (0.6) (0.6)
Employee benefits including ESOP dividend (0.3) (0.3) (0.5)
Impact of tax reform re-measurement —  —  (81.6 )
Internal restructure —  (9.1) (0.6)
Noncontrolling interests (0.5) (0.5) (0.6)
Non-deductible goodwill 0.1  4.7  1.0
Other , net (0.7) (0.6) (2.0)
Effective income tax rate 13.0 % 18.3 % (48.3 )%
The effective income tax rate for 2019  was 13.0%  compared to 18.3%  for 2018 . The decrease in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was primarily
due to the recognition of approximately $2.2 billion  of a non-recu rring tax benefit in connection with the disposition of preferred stock, representing a minority interest in a
foreign affiliate in 2019 compared to the non-recurring deferred tax benefit of approximately  $2.1 billion , as a result of an internal reorganization of legal entities within the
historical W ireless business, which was of fset by a goodwill char ge that is not deductible for tax purposes in 2018.
The effective income tax rate for 2018  was 18.3%  compa red to (48.3)%  for 2017 . The increas e in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was
primarily due to the non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $16.8 billion  recorded in 2017 for the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower 21% U.S.
federal corpor ate income tax rate, as a result of the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017. In addition, the provision for income taxes for 2018 includes the tax impact
of the Media goodwill impairment charge not deduc tible for tax purposes, offset by the reduction in the statutory U.S federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%,
effective January 1, 2018 under the TCJA and a non-recurring deferred tax benefit of approximately $2.1 billion  as a result of an internal reorganization of legal entities within
the historical W ireless business.
In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Com mission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 to provide guidance for companies that had not completed their
accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SAB 118 allowed for a provisional estimate
of the impact s of the TCJA in our earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 , as well as up to a one year measurement period that ended on December 22, 2018, for any
subsequent adjustments to such provisional estimate. In 2018, Verizon completed its analysis of the impacts of the TCJA , including analyzing the effects of any IRS and U.S.
Treasury guidance issued , and state tax law changes enacted, within the one year measurement period resulting in no significant adjustments to the $16.8 billion  provisional
amount recorded in December 2017 .
The amounts of cash taxes paid by V erizon are as follows:
 (dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31, 2019  2018  2017
Income taxes, net of amounts refunded $ 3,583  $ 2,213  $ 4,432
Employment taxes 1,044  1,066  1,207
Property and other taxes 1,551  1,598  1,737
Total $ 6,178  $ 4,877  $ 7,376
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
Deferred taxes arise because of dif ferences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
 (dollars in millions)  
At December 31, 2019  2018
Deferr ed Tax Assets    
Employee benefits $ 5,048  $ 5,403
Tax loss and credit carry forwards 3,012  3,576
Other - assets 5,595  1,650
 13,655  10,629
Valuation allowances (2,260 ) (2,741 )
Deferred tax assets 11,395  7,888
    
Deferr ed Tax Liabilities    
Spectrum and other intangible amortization 22,388  21,976
Depreciation 16,884  15,662
Other - liabilities 6,742  3,976
Deferred tax liabilities 46,014  41,614
Net deferr ed tax liability $ 34,619  $ 33,726
At December 31, 2019 , undistribute d earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the U.S. amounted to approximately $3.8 billion . The majority of
Verizon's cash flow is generated from domestic operations and we are not dependent on foreign cash or earnings to meet our funding requirements, nor do we intend to
repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations.  Furthermore, a portion of these undistributed earnings represents amounts that legally must be kept in
reserve in accordance with certain foreign jurisdiction al requirements and are unavailable for distribution or repatriation.  As a result, we have not provided U.S. deferred taxes
on these undistributed earnings because we intend that they will remain indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and therefore unavailable for use in funding U.S. operations. 
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
At December 31, 2019 , we had net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately $3.0 billion  that primarily relate to state and foreign taxes.
Of these net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards, approximately $2.0 billion  will expire between 2020  and 2039 and approximately $1.0 billion  may be carried forward
indefinitely .
During 2019 , the valuation allowance decreased  approximately $481 million . The balance of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2019  and the 2019  activity is primarily
related to state and foreign taxes.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
   (dollars in millions)  
 2019  2018  2017
Balance at January 1, $ 2,871  $ 2,355  $ 1,902
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 149  160  219
Additions for tax positions of prior years 297  699  756
Reductions for tax positions of prior years (300) (248) (419)
Settlements (58) (40) (42)
Lapses of statutes of limitations (89) (55) (61)
Balance at December  31, $ 2,870  $ 2,871  $ 2,355
Included in the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 , 2018  and 2017  is $2.4 billion , $2.3 billion  and $1.9 billion , respectively , that if recognized, would
favorably af fect the ef fective income tax rate.
We recognized the following net after -tax expenses related to interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes:
Years Ended December 31, (dollars in millions)
2019 $ 35
2018 75
2017 77
The after -tax accruals for the payment of interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
At December 31, (dollars in millions)
2019 $ 385
2018 348
Verizon and/or its subsidia ries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer , we are under audit
by the IRS and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open tax years. The IRS is currently examining the Company’ s U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2013-
2014 and Cellco Partnership's U.S. income tax retur n for tax year 2013-2014. Tax controversies are ongoing for tax years as early as 2005. The amount of the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and it is reasonably possible that
various curre nt tax examinations will conclude or require reevaluations of the Company’ s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range of the possible change
cannot be made until these tax matters are further developed or resolved.
Note 13. Segment Information
Reportable Segments
As discussed in Note 1, in November 2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business. Under the new structure, effective April 1, 2019, there are two reportable
segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units  - Consumer  and Business . We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating
income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment performance.
Our segments and their principal activities consist of the following:
Segment  Description
Verizon Consumer
Group
 Our Consumer segment provides consumer -focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are
provided across one of the most extensive wireless  networks in the United States under the Verizon brand and through wholesale and other
arrangements. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our
100% fiber -optic network under the Fios brand and over a traditional copper -based network to customers who are not served by Fios.
Verizon
Business Gr oup
 Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, video and data services, corporate networking
solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and
products. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and
select products and services to customers around the world.
Our Consume r segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on
a wholesale basis.  Our Business  segment’ s wireless and wireline products and services are organized by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings: Global
Enterprise, Small and Medium Business, Public Sector and Other , and Wholesale.
Corporate and other includ es the results of our media business,V erizon Media, and other businesses, invest ments in unconsolidated businesses, unallocated corporate expenses,
certain pension and other employee benefit related costs and interest and financing expenses. Corporate and
other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due to their
nature. Altho ugh such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are include d in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these
transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment
performance.
We completed our acquisition of Y ahoo's operating business on June 13, 2017 and as such results are included since the acquisition date.
In May 2017, we completed the Data Center Sale, where we sold 23 customer -facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America to Equinix. The results of operations for
this divestiture and other insignificant transactions are included within Corporate and other for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent
with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker .
The reconciliation of segm ent operating revenues and expenses to consolidated operating revenues and expenses below includes the effects of special items that the chief
operating decision maker does not consider in assessing segment performance, primarily because of their nature.
The following tables provides operating financial information for our two reportable segments:

Note 14. Equity and Comprehensive Income
Equity
In December 2019, 46,100  preferred shares of a foreign affiliate of Verizon was sold for cash consideration of $51 million  and is reflected in non-controlling interests. The
preferred shares pay cumulative dividends of 8.25%  per annum.
Common Stock
In February 2020, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million  shares of the Company's common stock. The program
will terminate  when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches  100 million , or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is
sooner . During the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon’ s common stock under our previously authorized share
buyback programs. At December 31, 2019 , the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100
million .
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee  and shareholder plans. During the years ended  December 31, 2019 ,
2018 , and 2017 , we issued  3.8 million , 3.5 million  and 2.8 million  common shares from T reasury stock, respectively , which had an insignificant aggregate value.
In connection  with our acquisition of Straight Path in February 2018, we issued approximately 49 million  shares  of Verizon commo n stock, valued at approximately $2.4
billion .

Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involv ed in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state and federal level. Where it is determined, in
consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter , the Company establishes an accrual. In none of the
currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be
made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and demands; (2) a less than complete factual record;
(3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously
monitor these  proceedings as they develop and adjus t any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of any pending regulatory or legal
matter in future periods will have a material ef fect on our financial condition, but it could have a material ef fect on our results of operations for a given reporting period.
Verizon is currently involved in approximately 25 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents. Most of these cases are brought by non-
practicing entities and effectively seek only monetar y damages; a small number are brought by companies that have sold products and could seek injunctive relief as well.
These cases have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved.
In connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers
pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time,
counterparties may make claims under these provisions, and V erizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of business.
Subsequent to the sale of Verizon Information Services Canada in 2004, we continue to provide a guarantee to publish directories, which was issued when the directory
business was purchased in 2001 and had a 30-year term (before extensio ns). The preexisting guara ntee continues, without modification, despite the subsequent sale of Verizon
Information Services Canada and the spin-of f of our domestic print and Internet yellow pages directories business. The possible financial impact of the guarantee, which is not
expected to be adverse, cannot be reasonably estimated as a variety of the potential outcomes available under the guarantee result in costs and revenues or benefits that may
offset each other . We do not believe performance under the guarantee is likely .
As of December 31, 2019 , letters of credit totaling approximately $632 million , which  were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing
arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding.
During 2019, Verizon entered into a renewable energy purchase agreement (REP A) with a third party . The REPA is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-
generating facility and has a fixed price term of 12 years  from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation, which is expected to begin by the end of
2020. The REP A generally is expected to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as ener gy is generated by the facility .
We have various commitm ents, totaling $18.8 billion , primarily to purchase programming and network services, equipment, software and marketing services, which will be
used or sold in the ordinary  course of business, from a variety of suppliers. Of this total amount, $8.4 billion  is attributable to 2020 , $7.5 billion  is attributable to 2021  through
2022 , $1.4 billion  is attributable to 2023  through 2024  and $1.5 billion  is attributable to years thereafter . These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the
future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the noncancelable quantities or
termination
amounts. Purchases agains t our commitments totaled approximately $10.9 billion  for 2019 , $9.0 billion  for 2018  and $8.2 billion  for 2017 . Since the commitments to purchase
programming services from television networks and broadcast stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of subscribers at
December 31, 2019 , and applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in ef fect at that time. W e also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment.

Disposition of Preferred Stock
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed the disposition of preferred stock, representing a minority interest in a foreign affiliate, which resulted in a non-recurring

Historical Wireless Legal Entity Restructuring
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed an internal reorganization of legal entities within the histo rical Wireless business which resulted in a non-recurring income tax
benefit of approximately $2.1 billion  in our conso lidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reduced our deferred tax liability by the same
amount.
