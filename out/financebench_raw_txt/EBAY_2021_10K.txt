BUSINESS Overview
eBay
 Inc.  was  formed  as  a  sole  proprietorship  in  September  1995  and  was  incorporated  in  California  in  May  1996.  In  April  1998,  wereincorporated in Delaware, and in S
eptember 1998, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock. Our principal executive offices arelocated
 at 2025 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California, 95125, and our telephone number is (408) 376-7008. Unless otherwise expressly stated orthe
 context  otherwise  requires,  when  we  refer  to  “we,”  “our,”  “us,”  or  “eBay”  in  this  annual  report  on  Form  10-K,  we  mean  eBay  Inc.  and  itsconsolidated subsidiaries.
eBay
 is a global commerce leader through our Marketplace platforms which connect millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 marketsaround
 the  world.  The  platforms  include  our  online  marketplace  located  at  www.ebay.com  and  its  localized  counterparts,  including  off-platformbusinesses
 in Japan and Turkey, as well as eBay’s suite of mobile apps. Our platforms are accessible through an online experience (e.g. desktopand
 laptop  computers),  iOS  and  Android  mobile  devices  (e.g.  smartphones  and  tablets)  and  our  application  programming  interfaces  (“APIs,”platform access for third party software developers).
Notably, on
 June 24 , 2021, we completed the sale of our Classifieds business to Adevinta ASA (“Adevinta”) for $2.5 billion in cash, subject tocertain
 adjustments, and 540 million Adevinta shares, and on November 18, 2021, eBay completed the sale of approximately 135 million shares ofAdevinta
 to  Astinlux  Finco  S.a.r.l.  (“Permira”)  for  approximately  $2.3  billion  in  cash.  Further,  on  November  14,  2021,  we  completed  the  sale  of80.01%
 of our ownership stake in eBay Korea LLC to E-mart Inc. (“Emart”) for approximately $3.0 billion of gross cash proceeds subject to certainadjustments.
Our Strategy
As a global commerce leader and third-party marketplace, our technol
ogies and services are designed to provide buyers choice and a breadthof
 relevant inventory from around the globe, and to enable sellers’ access to eBay’s 147 million buyers worldwide. Our business model and pricingare
 designed so that our business is successful when our sellers are successful. We earn revenue primarily through fees collected on paid sales,payment processing and first-party advertising.
eBay’s
 strategy is to leverage technology to enhance the marketplace experience for our customers to drive growth in Gross MerchandiseVolume
 (“GMV”),  while  increasing  the  rate  of  revenue  growth  through  our  managed  payments  and  advertising  initiatives  and  delivering  healthyoperating
 margins. In 2020, we embarked on a multi-year journey to build more compelling category experiences for enthusiastic consumers, tobecome the
 partner of choice for sellers and to strengthen trust in relationships with buyers on our platforms. We derived a majority of GMV in 2021from the following product categories — parts & accessories, consumer electronics an
d home & garden.4

Table of ContentsDuring
 2021, we completed the migration of eBay’s managed payments in all markets, delivering buyers and sellers a simplified end-to-endpayments
 experience. Through managed payments, we are able to provide a frictionless experience for current and next-generation  customers,consistent
 with today’s retail standards. We offer buyers more flexibility and choice in how they’d like to pay and offer sellers a more streamlinedway to run their businesses.
Our
 advertising business remains focused on growing our Promoted Listings offerings (our first-party  advertising products) while reducingnon-strategic,
 third-party  advertising.  In  2021,  we  launched  three  new  products:  Promoted  Listings  Express  (a  cost-per-acquisition  product  forauction
 listings), Promoted Listings Advanced (a cost-per-click product) and External Promoted Listings (an off-platform advertising product). Thesenew
 products complement our existing first-party advertising offering, Promoted Listings Standard (a cost-per-acquisition product for fixed-pricedlistings).
 Through  our  portfolio  of  Promoted  Listings  offerings,  we  are  providing  sellers  with  data-driven  recommendations  to  optimize  theirconversion
 and drive velocity, while testing and building more technology features to drive growth, position eBay as the seller’s platform of choiceand surface relevant inventory to buyers.
Our Customer Offerings
We
 provide a number of features for our sellers and buyers that align with our approach to becoming the partner of choice for sellers andbuilding life-long, trusted buyer relatio
nships. These offerings are designed to build trust and confidence on our platform and drive GMV.To
 become the partner of choice for sellers, eBay continuously invests in technology to enhance the selling experience and products to growthe
 seller tools ecosystem. The new unified listing experience offers an intuitive and cohesive design across all platforms — desktop, mobile andapp
 — simplifying the listing flow and enhancing seller benefits. Using computer vision technology, we launched a tool that allows sellers to scanselect
 trading cards using eBay’s mobile apps to create a listing in less time. eBay expanded the Promoted Listings offerings to make it easier forsellers
 to drive velocity. We also launched personalized tools, such as coded coupons, to support a richer online seller experience. Coded couponsmake
 it possible for sellers to personalize and distribute offers to their target customers, and 6.2 million unique buyers have made purchases usingcoded
 coupons and 69 thousand sellers have made sales with the use of coded coupons since launching in early 2021. In addition, all Seller Hubusers
 are able to access Terapeak Product Research for free across a number of our markets — U.S., U.K., Germany, Australia, France, Italy,Spain and Canada — provid
ing pricing insights and listing quality reports without any barriers.In order to
 further strengthen our buyers’ confidence and trust in our services, we offer “eBay Money Back Guarantee,” which allows buyers toreceive
 their money back if the item they ordered does not arrive, is faulty or damaged or does not match the listing. eBay Money Back Guaranteecovers
 most items purchased on the eBay platform in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Australia, Canada, France, Italy and Spain through a qualifyingpayment
 method. In 2021, eBay expanded "Authenticity Guarantee," an independent authentication service, to more luxury categories and moremarkets.
 We now authenticate  watches sold over $2,000 in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany;  select sneakers sold over $100 in the U.S., U.K.,Germany,
 Australia  and Canada;  and select  handbags  sold over  $500  in the  U.S.  Additionally,  to  meet  consumer  demand  for  top  products,  weexpanded
 our  eBay  Refurbished  offering,  a  dedicated  destination  that  brings  inventory  from  pre-selected  brands  and  top  rated  sellers  withstandardized condition g
rading.eBay
 also invests in product experiences that delight our customers and enhance the buying experience for our enthusiasts. Our Collectiontool
 allows enthusiasts to view, manage and to track the value of their trading card collection. eBay has increased the tools available for our Motorsenthusiasts
 by expanding the My Garage feature to Canada, Italy, France and Spain and adding a motorcycle parts finder to the fitment shoppingexperience.
 In the U.S., we added our entire parts and accessories inventory to the eBay Motors app, making it easier to find the most relevantinventory.

Table of ContentsOur Impact and Responsibility
eBay’s
 purpose  is  to  empower  people  and  create  economic  opportunity  for  all  through  our  technology  for  our  global  community  of  users.Every
 day, people build businesses on our platforms. With a low cost of entry for sellers, we offer a highly accessible way for all types of users tointeract in a global marketplace that’s inclusive and connects peopl
e of all backgrounds. Accordingly, we prioritize our corporate responsibility effortsto
 impact the areas of economic empowerment and sustainable commerce. Key economic programs include eBay for Charity, the eBay Foundationand our small business enableme
nt efforts, such as our Up & Running Grants program.eBay
 for Charity empowers buyers and sellers to support charities around the world. In 2021, eBay for Charity matched donations made toDirect
 Relief  and  partnered  with  OXFAM,  Make  a  Wish  Foundation,  Stop  AAPI  Hate  and  The  Andy  Warhol  Foundation.  In  2021,  more  than$145 million was raised by buyers an
d sellers to support charities via eBay for Charity.The
 eBay  Foundation  helps  to  build  economically  vibrant  and  thriving  communities.  During  2021,  the  eBay  Foundation  granted  over$14
 million  to  support  historically  excluded  entrepreneurs  and  our  employee  gift-matching  program.  The  eBay  Foundation  also  increased  ouremployee
 gift-matching annual cap to $10,000 per employee, per year. To date, the eBay Foundation has awarded more than $76 million to morethan 1,800 nonprofits.
In
 2021, eBay committed to invest $25 million in the Clear Vision Impact Fund to bolster small- and medium-sized minority-owned businessesthat support historically under-served communities.
Recommerce
 has been an integral part of eBay’s purpose since the Company was founded in 1995. As a pioneer of the circular economy,eBay
 has created a space where people can buy and sell pre-owned goods. This helps preserve the world’s natural resources and reduces theCompany’s carbon footprint by saving on the water and e
nergy typically used in producing new goods and saves them from being sent to landfills.eBay
 continued its work to reach its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025 and signed its second virtual power purchase agreement in2021.
 In our continued efforts to address climate change, we announced an updated carbon reduction goal that has been approved by the ScienceBased
 Target initiative: eBay commits to reduce its own (scope 1 and scope 2) emissions 90% by 2030 from a 2019 base year and to reduce valuechain
 (scope 3) emissions from downstream transportation and distribution by 20% in the same timeframe. We will also be carbon neutral for ourscope 1
 and 2 emissions by the end of 2021 and each year moving forward. eBay was ranked in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s GreenPower
 Partnership  National  Top 100 and Top 30 Tech  & Telecom  for  the second  year.  Additionally,  we strive  to integrate  best  practices  in ouroffices
 and data center operations and to continually reduce our environmental footprint. This year, eBay was also recognized for its commitment tosustainability
 and  responsible  business  by  its  inclusion  in  the  Dow  Jones  Sustainability  Indices  World  and  North  American  Indices  for  the  thirdstraight year. eBay also scored an A- on the CDP Climate Chan
ge questionnaire.Financial Information
We measure our footprint
 in our addressable market according to GMV. GMV consists of the total value of all paid transactions between userson our platforms during the applicable perio
d inclusive of shipping fees and taxes. In 2021, we generated $87 billion in GMV, of which approximately54
 percent was generated outside the U.S. We believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overall volume of paid transactions that flowthrough our platforms in a given period.
At
 the end of 2021, eBay had 147 million active buyers and 17 million sellers. In 2021, we had approximately 1.5 billion live listings globally.The
 term “active buyer” means, as of any date, all buyer accounts that paid for a transaction on our platforms within the previous 12-month period.Buyers
 may  register  more  than  once  and,  as  a  result,  may  have  more  than  one  account.  “Sellers”  include  consumer-to-consumer  (“C2C”)  andbusiness-to-consumer (“B2C”) sellers that have received payment for a transaction on our platforms within the prev
ious 12-month period.We
 generate revenue primarily from the transactions we successfully enable, including monetization of managed payments and first-partyadvertising
 and through marketing services. The majority of our revenue comes from a take rate on the GMV of transactions paid on our platforms.We define “take rate” as net transaction revenues divided by GMV.

Table of ContentsOur platforms are
 designed to enable our buyers and sellers to leverage our economies of scale and capital investments, such as in sales andmarketing, mobile, customer acquisition, technology in
novation and customer service.Notable Business Transactions in 2021 and 2020
We
 regularly review and manage our investments to ensure they support eBay’s strategic direction and complement our disciplined approachto value creation, profitability and capital al
location. eBay completed the sale of its Classifieds business to Adevinta for $2.5 billion in cash, subject tocertain
 adjustments, and 540 million Adevinta shares in the second quarter of 2021, then completed the sale of approximately 135 million shares ofour
 Adevinta stake to Permira for approximately $2.3 billion in cash in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, we completed the sale of 80.01% ofour
 ownership stake in eBay Korea LLC to E-mart for approximately $3.0 billion of gross cash proceeds, subject to certain adjustments in the fourthquarter of 2021.
In the first quarter of 2020, we completed the sale of StubHub to viagogo for $4.05 bil
lion in cash, subject to certain adjustments.Competition
We
 encounter vigorous competition in our business from numerous sources. Our users can list, sell, buy, and pay for similar items through avariety
 of competing online, mobile and offline channels. These include, but are not limited to, retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and exportcompanies,
 auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, directories, search engines, commerce participants (consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer and business-to-business), shoppin
g channels and networks. As our product offerings continue to broaden into new categories of itemsand
 new commerce formats, we expect to face additional competition from other online, mobile and offline channels for those new offerings. Wecompete on the basis of price, product selection and services, and g
lobal scale.For
 more information regarding competitive factors impacting our business, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the captions“Substantial
 and increasingly intense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our business” and “We are subject to regulatory activity andantitrust litigation under competition laws that coul
d adversely impact our business.”Government Regulation
Government
 regulation impacts key aspects of our business. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations that affect the ecommerceindustry in many countries where we operate.
With
 two additional states adopting Internet sales tax laws in 2021, some buyers across the U.S. encountered sales tax for the first time oneBay.
 To date, 45 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have enacted Internet sales tax legislation. Additionally, a digital service tax(DST)
 was  implemented  in  Spain  in  2021,  and  we  are  complying  with  the  legislation.  Our  business  will  also  be  required  to  increase  paymentsreporting
 requirements  for  U.S.  sellers  as  a  result  of  federal  legislation.  Starting  on  January  1,  2022,  all  businesses  that  process  payments  arerequired
 to issue a Form 1099-K for all sellers who receive $600 or more in sales, a decrease from the previous reporting threshold of $20,000 and200
 transactions.  Form  1099-Ks  for  the  new  thresholds  will  be  issued  in  January  2023.  Tax  collection  responsibility  and  the  additional  costsassociated
 with complex sales and use tax collection, remittance and audit requirements, or reporting, could create additional burdens for buyersand sellers on our websites and mobil
e platforms.Legislation
 requiring increased seller information collection, verification and disclosure for online marketplaces was considered in a number ofstates
 and passed into law in Arkansas in 2021. Federal legislation is also being considered by Congress. Increased seller mandates could createadditional burdens for sellers on our we
bsites and mobile platforms.For
 more information regarding regulatory risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “Our business is subject toextensive
 government regulation and oversight, which could adversely impact our business” and “Our business and our sellers and buyers may besubject to sales and other tax regimes in various jurisdictio
ns, which may harm our business.”7

Table of ContentsSeasonality
We
 expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to mirror general consumer buying patterns. Please see the additional information in“Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financ
ial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Seasonality.”Technology
The
 eBay Marketplace uses a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by others.We
 have developed intuitive user interfaces, buyer, seller and developer tools and transaction processing, database and network applications thathelp
 enable  our  users  to  reliably  and  securely  complete  transactions  on  our  sites.  Our  technology  infrastructure  simplifies  the  storage  andprocessing
 of large amounts of data, eases the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services and automates much of theadministration
 of  large-scale  clusters  of  computers.  Our  infrastructure  has  been  designed  around  industry-standard  architectures  to  reducedowntime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences.
In
 support  of  our  commitment  to  innovation  and  a  better  customer  experience,  we  have  been  on  a  multi-year  evolution  to  modernize  ourmarketplace.
 Through  technologies  like  artificial  intelligence,  we  are  anticipating  the  needs  of  buyers,  sellers  and  developers,  empoweringentrepreneurs
 looking  to  grow  their  business,  and  making  the  platform  more  accessible  to  everyone.  We  aim  to  create  highly  personalized  andinspiring shopping experiences
 powered by advanced technologies.For
 information regarding technology-related risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the captions “Our business is subjectto
 online  security  risks,  including  security  breaches  and  cyberattacks,”  “Systems  failures  and  resulting  interruptions  in  the  availability  of  ordegradat
ion in the performance of our websites, applications, products or services could harm our business” and “Regulation in the areas of privacyand protection of user data could harm our business.”
Intellectual Property
We
 regard  the  protection  of  our  intellectual  property,  including  our  trademarks  (particularly  those  covering  the  eBay  name),  patents,copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectu
al property rights by relyingon federal, state and common
 law rights in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractualrestrictions
 to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We routinely enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreementswith
 our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to limit access to and disclosure ofour proprietary information.
We
 pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we have filedU.S.
 and  international  patent  applications  covering  certain  aspects  of  our  proprietary  technology.  Effective  trademark,  copyright,  patent,  domainname,
 trade dress and trade secret protection is typically expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual propertyrights
 and  other  proprietary  rights  in  an  increasing  number  of  jurisdictions,  a  process  that  is  expensive  and  time  consuming  and  may  not  besuccessful.
We have
 registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in placean
 active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. If we are unable toregister
 or protect our trademarks or domain names, we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in which our trademarks or domain namesare
 not  registered  or  protected.  We  have  licensed  in  the  past,  and  expect  to  license  in  the  future,  certain  of  our  proprietary  rights,  such  astrademarks or copyrighted material, to others.
From
 time to time, third parties have claimed — and others will likely claim in the future — that we have infringed their intellectual propertyrights. We are
 typically involved in a number of such legal proceedings at any time. Please see the information in “Item 3: Legal Proceedings” and in“Item
 1A: Risk Factors” under the captions “The listing or sale by our users of certain items, including items that allegedly infringe the intellectualproperty
 rights of rights owners, such as pirated or counterfeit items, illegal items or items used in an illegal manner may harm our business,” and“We
 may  be  unable  to  adequately  protect  or  enforce  our  intellectual  property  rights  and  face  ongoing  allegations  by  third  parties  that  we  areinfringing their intellectual prop
erty rights.”8

Table of ContentsRisk Factors:
You
 should carefully review the following discussion of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, aswell
 as  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  and  the  other  information  appearing  in  this  report,  for  important  informationregarding risks that affect
 us. Current global economic events and conditions may amplify many of these risks. These risks are not the only risks thatmay affect us. Additi
onal risks that we are not aware of or do not believe are material at the time of this filing may also become important factors thatadversely affect our business.
Business, Economic, Market and Operating Risks
Our
 operating and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition,results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock and d
ebt securities.Our
 operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly asa result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the following risks and other risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section.
•
our ability to convert visits into sales for our sellers;•
the amount and timing of expenses;•
our success in attracting and retaining sellers and buyers;•
changes in consumer discretionary spending trends, including shifts in interests away from any of our major categories;•
our success in executing on our strategy and the impact of any changes in our strategy;•
the timing and success of product launches, including new services and features we may introduce;•
the success of our marketing efforts; and•
the impact of competitive developments and our response to those developments.In
 view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and youshould not rely upon them as
 an indication of future performance. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings (loss)accurately,
 particularly given that substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales during that quarter. Dueto
 the  inherent  difficulty  in  forecasting  revenues,  it  is  also  difficult  to  forecast  expenses  as  a  percentage  of  net  revenues.  Quarterly  and  annualexpenses
 as  a  percentage  of  net  revenues  reflected  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements  may  be  significantly  different  from  historical  orprojected percenta
ges. Because our business model is dependent upon consumer spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in oruncertainty
 about macro-economic conditions. Our buyers may in the future have less capacity for discretionary purchases and may reduce theirpurchases
 from our sellers as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, changes in federaleconomic policy, the COVID-19 pandemic and rece
nt international trade disputes.Substantial and increasing
ly intense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our business.The businesses and markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We currently and potentially compet
e with a wide variety of onlineand
 offline  companies  providing  goods  and  services  to  consumers  and  merchants,  a  number  of  which  have  significant  resources,  large  usercommunities
 and well-established brands. The Internet and mobile networks provide new, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels forthe
 sale  of  all  types  of  goods  and  services.  We  compete  in  two-sided  markets,  and  must  attract  both  buyers  and  sellers  to  use  our  platforms.Consumers
 who purchase or sell goods and services through us have more and more alternatives, and merchants have more channels to reachconsumers.
 We expect competition to continue to intensify. The barriers to entry into these channels can be low, and businesses can easily launchonline
 sites or mobile platforms and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number ofsuccessful
 ecommerce, search, advertising or social companies. As we respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time totime,
 make pricing, service, policy or marketing decisions or acquisitions that may be controversial with and lead to dissatisfaction among sellers,which could reduce activity on our platform and harm our reputation a
nd profitability.12

Table of ContentsWe
 face increased competitive pressure online and offline. In particular, the competitive norm for, and the expected level of service from,ecommerce
 and  mobile  commerce  has  significantly  increased  due  to,  among  other  factors,  improved  user  experience,  greater  ease  of  buyinggoods,
 lower  (or  no)  shipping  costs,  faster  shipping  times  and  more  favorable  return  policies.  In  addition,  certain  platform  businesses,  such  asAlibaba,
 Amazon,  Apple,  Facebook  and  Google,  many  of  whom  are  larger  than  us  or  have  greater  capitalization,  have  a  dominant  and  secureposition in other
 industries or certain significant markets, and offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer. If weare
 unable  to  change  our  products,  offerings  and  services  in  ways  that  reflect  the  changing  demands  of  ecommerce  and  mobile  commercemarketplaces,
 or if products offered through eBay are not available for purchase where the consumers shop, particularly the higher growth of salesof
 fixed-price  items  and  higher  expected  service  levels  (some  of  which  depend  on  services  provided  by  sellers  on  our  platforms),  or  competeeffectively with and adapt to changes in larger pl
atform businesses, our business and reputation will suffer.Competitors
 with  other  revenue  sources  may  also  be  able  to  devote  more  resources  to  marketing  and  promotional  campaigns  and  buyeracquisition,
 adopt  more  aggressive  pricing  policies  and  devote  more  resources  to  website,  mobile  platforms  and  applications  and  systemsdevelopment
 than  we can.  Other  competitors  may  offer  or  continue  to  offer  faster  and/or  free  shipping,  delivery  on Sunday,  same-day  delivery,favorable
 return policies or other transaction-related services which improve the user experience on their sites and which could be impractical orinefficie
nt for our sellers to match. Competitors may be more narrowly focused on a particular type of goods and create a compelling community, beable
 to innovate faster and more efficiently, and new technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling competitors to offer moreefficient or lower-cost services.
Some
 of our competitors control other products and services that are important to our success, including credit card interchange, Internetsearch, and mobile operating systems.
 Such competitors could manipulate pricing, availability, terms or operation of service related to their productsand services in a manner that impacts our
 competitive offerings. For example, Google, which operates a shopping platform service, has from time totime
 made changes to its search algorithms that reduced the amount of search traffic directed to us from searches on Google. If we are unable touse
 or adapt to operational changes in such services, we may face higher costs for such services, face integration or technological barriers or losecustomers, which could cause our business to suffer.
Consumers
 who might use our sites to buy goods have a wide variety of alternatives, including traditional department, warehouse, boutique,discount and
 general merchandise stores (as well as the online and mobile operations of these traditional retailers), online retailers and their relatedmobile
 offerings, online and offline aggregation and classified services, social media platforms and other shopping channels, such as offline andonline
 home shopping networks. In the United States, these include, but are not limited to, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Walmart, Target, Macy’s,Etsy,
 StockX, Shopify, Wayfair, TheRealReal, Overstock.com and Rakuten, among others. In addition, consumers have a large number of onlineand offline channels focused on o
ne or more of the categories of products offered on our site.Consumers also
 can turn to many companies that offer a variety of services that provide other channels for buyers to find and buy items fromsellers
 of all sizes, including social media, online aggregation and classifieds platforms, such as websites operated by Adevinta or Naspers Limitedand
 others  such  as craigslist,  Oodle.com  and Facebook.  Consumers  also can turn  to  shopping-comparison  sites,  such as Google Shopping,  orsocial
 networks that enable purchases such as Pinterest and Facebook. In certain markets, our fixed-price listing and traditional auction-style listingformats increasingly are
 being challenged by other formats, such as classifieds. We use product search engines and paid search advertising to helpusers
 find our sites, but these services also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations. Consumers may choose tosearch
 for products and services with a horizontal search engine or shopping comparison website, and such sites may also send users to othershopping
 destinations. In addition, sellers are increasingly utilizing multiple sales channels, including the acquisition of new customers by paying forsearch-related advertisements on horizontal search en
gine sites, such as Google, Naver and Baidu.Consumers
 and merchants who might use our sites to sell goods also have many alternatives, including general ecommerce sites, such asAmazon,
 Alibaba,  and  Zalando,  and  more  specialized  sites,  such  as  Etsy.  Our  international  sites  also  compete  for  sellers  with  general  andspecialized
 ecommerce sites. Sellers may also choose to sell their goods through other channels, such as multi-channel services like Shopify orclassifieds
 platforms. Consumers and merchants also can create and sell through their own sites, and may choose to purchase online advertisinginstead of using our services.
 We generate a substantial amount of our revenue from our Promoted Listings (a first-party advertising offering) and, toa
 lesser  extent,  third-party  advertising.  To  sustain  or  increase  our  advertising  revenue,  we  must  continue  to  provide  customers  with  compellingadvertising products to maintain or
13

Table of Contentsincrease
 the amount of advertising purchased through our platform. If we are unable to compete effectively for advertising spend, our business andoperating
 results could be harmed. In some countries, there are online sites that have larger customer bases and greater brand recognition, as wellas
 competitors  that  may  have  a  better  understanding  of  local  culture  and  commerce.  We  may  increasingly  compete  with  local  competitors  indeveloping countries that have un
ique advantages, such as a greater ability to operate under local regulatory authorities.In
 addition, certain manufacturers may limit or cease distribution of their products through online channels, such as our sites. Manufacturersmay
 attempt to use contractual obligations or existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit ecommerce in certain categories of goodsor
 services. Manufacturers may also attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance or minimum advertised price arrangements to preventdistributors
 from selling on our platforms or on the Internet generally, or drive distributors to sell at prices that would make us less attractive relativeto
 other alternatives. The adoption by those or other policies could adversely affect our results of operations and result in loss of market share anddiminished value of our brands.
The principal competitive factors for us include the follow
ing:    
•
ability to attract, retain and engage buyers and sellers;•
volume of transactions and price and selection of goods;•
trust in the seller and the transaction;•
customer service;•
brand recognition;    •
community cohesion, interaction and size;•
website, mobile platform and application ease-of-use and accessibility;•
system reliability and security;•
reliability of delivery and payment, including customer preference for fast delivery and free shipping and returns;•
level of service fees; and•
quality of search tools.We
 may  be  unable  to  compete  successfully  against  current  and  future  competitors.  Some  current  and  potential  competitors  have  longeroperating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recog
nition in other business and Internet sectors than we do.The global COVID-19 pandemic cou
ld harm our business and results of operations.The
 global spread of COVID-19 variants and related measures to contain its spread (such as government mandated business closures andshelter
 in-place guidelines) have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemicimpacts
 our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in the future will depend on numerous evolving factors that we cannotpredict,
 including the duration and scope of the pandemic; any resurgence of the pandemic; the availability and distribution of effective treatmentsand
 vaccines; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact ofthe
 pandemic on national and global economic activity, unemployment levels and financial markets, including the possibility of a national or globalrecession;
 the potential for shipping difficulties, including slowed deliveries from sellers to their customers; and the ability of consumers to pay forproducts.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has generally resulted in a decrease in consumer spending, which could have an adverse impact on our sellersthrough
 reduced consumer demand for their products and availability of inventory, which could in turn negatively impact the demand for use of ourplatforms.
 Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to require employees to work remotely for an extended period of time, which couldnegatively
 impact our business and harm productivity and collaboration. If there is a prolonged impact of COVID-19, it could adversely affect ourbusiness,
 results  of  operations,  financial  condition  and  liquidity,  perhaps  materially.  The  future  impact  of  COVID-19  and  these  containmentmeasures
 cannot be predicted with certainty and may increase our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect ourbusiness, results of
 operations, financial condition and liquidity, and we cannot assure that we will have access to external financing at times and onterms we consider acceptable, or at all, or that we will not experience other li
quidity issues going forward.The
 COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  related  measures  to  contain  its  spread  did  not  adversely  affect  our  consolidated  results  of  operations.Initially,
 our  Marketplace  platforms  experienced  improved  traffic  and  buyer  acquisition  due  to  the  ongoing  impact  of  mobility  restrictions  takenglobally
 to contain the spread of COVID-19 and changes in consumer behaviors that have resulted in more online shopping. As restrictions haveloosened and
14

Table of Contentsmobility increases, we
 may experience lower traffic and buyer acquisition, and the impacts seen may continue to create volatility in our results and awider range of outcomes as consumer behaviors and mobi
lity restrictions continue to evolve.We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchang
e rates, which could negatively impact our financial results.Because we generate approx
imately half of our revenues outside the United States but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, our financialresults
 are  impacted  by  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  or  foreign  exchange  rates.  The  results  of  operations  of  many  of  ourinternationally
 focused  platforms  are  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuations  as  the  financial  results  of  the  applicable  subsidiaries  aretranslated from the local currency into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purpos
es.While
 from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure, it is impossible to predict oreliminate
 the  effects  of  this  exposure.  Fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates  could  significantly  impact  our  financial  results,  which  may  have  asignificant impact on the trading price of our common stock and debt securities.
Our international operations and eng
agement in cross-border trade are subject to risks, which could harm our business.Our
 international businesses, especially in the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia, and cross-border business from greater China, havegenerated
 a  majority  of  our  net  revenues  in  recent  years.  In  addition  to  uncertainty  about  our  ability  to  generate  revenues  from  our  foreignoperations and expand into intern
ational markets, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:•
uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions resulting from Brexit;•
expenses  associated  with  localizing  our  products  and  services  and  customer  data,  including  offering  customers  the  ability  to  transactbusiness
 in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we mayhave limited or no experience;
•
trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•
difficulties  in  developing,  staffing,  and  simultaneously  managing  a  large  number  of  varying  foreign  operations  as  a  result  of  distance,language, and cultural differences;
•
stringent local labor laws and regulations;•
credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•
profit  repatriation  restrictions,  foreign  currency  exchange  restrictions  or  extreme  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  for  aparticular currency;
•
global or regional economic conditions that impact companies and customers with which we do business;•
political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•
geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues (such as the coronavirus), acts of war, and terrorism;•
supply chain disruptions;•
import or export regulations;•
compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials,as well as U.S. and foreign laws design
ed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;•
antitrust and competition regulations;•
potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•
economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•
different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws;•
risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•
national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•
payment intermediation regulations;•
local licensing and reporting obligations; and•
increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable. 
Violations
 of the complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions,or
 sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although wehave implemented policies an
d procedures designed to15

Table of Contentspromote
 compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risksinherent in our international operati
ons and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and could harm our business.Cross-border
 trade is an important  source of both revenue and profits  for us. Cross-border  trade also represents  our primary (or in somecases,
 only) presence in certain important markets, such as China, and various other countries. The interpretation and/or application of laws, suchas
 those related to intellectual property rights of authentic products, selective distribution networks, and sellers in other countries listing items on theInternet,
 could  impose  restrictions  on,  or  increase  the  costs  of,  purchasing,  selling,  shipping,  or  returning  goods  across  national  borders.  Theshipping
 of goods across national borders is often more expensive and complicated than domestic shipping. Any factors that increase the costs ofcross-border
 trade or restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harmour business.
Our
 business may be adversely affected by geopolitical events, natural disasters, seasonal factors and other factors that cause our users tospend less time on our websites or mobile platforms and app
lications, including increased usage of other websites.Our
 users  may  spend  less  time  on  our  websites  and  our  applications  for  mobile  devices  as  a  result  of  a  variety  of  diversions,  including:geopolitical
 events, such as war, the threat of war, or terrorist activity; natural disasters or the effects of climate change (such as drought, flooding,wildfires,
 increased  storm  severity  and  sea  level  rise);  power  shortages  or  outages,  major  public  health  issues,  including  pandemics  (such  asCOVID-19
 variants); social networking or other entertainment websites or mobile applications; significant local, national or global events capturingthe
 attention of a large part of the population; and seasonal fluctuations due to a variety of factors. If any of these, or any other factors, divert ourusers from using our websites or mobile applications, our bus
iness could be materially adversely affected.If
 we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments or continue to innovate and create new initiatives to provide new programs,products and services, the use of our products and our revenues could d
ecline.Rapid,
 significant  technological  changes  continue  to  confront  the  industries  in  which  we  operate  and  we  cannot  predict  the  effect  oftechnological
 changes  on  our  business.  We  also  continuously  strive  to  create  new  initiatives  and  innovations  that  promote  growth,  such  as  ourpayments
 and advertising offerings and other features that enhance the customer experience. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, werely in
 part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new servicesand technologi
es applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge. These new services and technologies may be superior to,or
 render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Incorporating new technologies into our products and servicesmay require substantial expe
nditures and take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new servicesand
 develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, new laws and regulations, resistance to change from our users, clientsor
 merchants,  or  third  parties’  intellectual  property  rights.  Our  success  will  depend  on  our  ability  to  develop  new  technologies  and  adapt  totechnological changes a
nd evolving industry standards.Changes
 to  our  programs  to  protect  buyers  and  sellers  could  increase  our  costs  and  loss  rate,  and  failure  to  manage  such  programseffectively can result in harm to our reputation.
Our eBay Money Back Guarantee program represents the means by which we compens
ate users who believe that they have been defrauded,have
 not  received  the  item  that  they  purchased  or  have  received  an  item  different  from  what  was  described.  We  expect  to  continue  to  receivecommunications
 from  users  requesting  reimbursement  or  threatening  or  commencing  legal  action  against  us  if  no  reimbursement  is  made.  Ourliability
 for these sorts of claims is beginning to be clarified in some jurisdictions. Litigation involving liability for any such third-party actions could becostly
 and  time  consuming  for  us,  divert  management  attention,  result  in  increased  costs  of  doing  business,  lead  to  adverse  judgments  orsettlements
 or otherwise harm our business. In addition, affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us,including imposing fines o
r seeking injunctions.Additio
nally, in order to further strengthen our buyers’ confidence and trust in our services and the goods offered on our marketplace, in 2021,we 
expanded "Authenticity Guarantee," an independent authentication service, to more luxury categories and more markets. If we are unable toeffectively manage the authentication process, we may suffer harm to our reputation.
16

Table of ContentsDevelopment of our payments system requires ongoing inv
estment, is subject to evolving laws, regulations, rules, and standards, and involvesrisk, including risks related to our dependenc
e on third-party providers.We
 have invested and plan to continue to invest internal resources into our payments tools in order to maintain existing availability, expandinto
 additional markets and offer new payment methods and other types of financial services to our buyers and sellers. If we fail to invest adequateresources
 into  payments  on  our  platform,  or  if  our  investment  efforts  are  unsuccessful,  unreliable  or  result  in  system  failure,  our  payments  andfinancia
l services may not function properly or keep pace with competitive offerings, which could negatively impact their usage and our Marketplace.Future
 errors, failures or outages could cause our buyers and sellers to lose confidence in our payments system and could cause them to ceaseusing our marketplace.
If
 we transition to new third-party payment service providers for any reason, we may be required to invest significant financial and personnelresources
 to support such transition or could be unable to find a suitable replacement service provider. As we offer new payment methods andfinancial
 services to our sellers and buyers, we are now subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements, and exposed to heightenedfraud and regulatory risk, which could lead to an incre
ase in our operating expenses. We
 rely on third-party service providers to perform services related to compliance among other activities, credit card processing, paymentdisbursements,
 currency  exchange,  identity  verification,  sanctions  screening,  and  fraud  analysis  and  detection.  As  a  result,  we  are  subject  to  anumber
 of risks related to our dependence on third-party service providers. If any or some of these service providers fail to perform adequately or ifany
 such service provider were to terminate or modify its relationship with us unexpectedly, our sellers’ ability to use our platform to receive ordersor payments could be
 adversely affected, which would increase costs, drive sellers away from our marketplaces, result in potential legal liability, andharm
 our business. In addition, we and our third-party service providers may experience service outages from time to time that could adverselyimpact
 payments made on our platform. Additionally, any unexpected termination or modification of those third-party services could lead to a lapsein the effectiveness of certain fraud prevention and detection too
ls.Our
 third-party  service  providers  may  increase  the  fees  they  charge  us  in  the  future,  which  would  increase  our  operating  expenses.  Thiscould,
 in turn, require us to increase the fees we charge to sellers and cause some sellers to reduce listings on our marketplaces or to leave ourplatform altogether by closing their accounts.
Payments
 and other financial services are governed by complex and continuously evolving laws and regulations that are subject to changeand vary
 across different jurisdictions in the United States and globally. As a result, we are required to spend significant time and effort to determinewhether
 various licensing and registration laws relating to payments and other financial services we offer apply to us and to comply with applicablelaws and licensi
ng and registration regulations. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or retain any necessary licensesor
 registrations. Any failure or claim of failure on the part of the Company or its third-party service providers to comply with applicable laws andregulations
 relating to payments or financial services could require us to expend significant resources, result in liabilities, limit or preclude our abilityto enter
 certain markets and harm our reputation. In addition, changes in payment regulations, or other financial regulation, including changes to thecredit
 or  debit  card  interchange  rates  in  the  United  States  or  other  markets,  could  adversely  affect  payments  on  our  platform  and  make  ourpayments systems less profitable
. Further,
 we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements pursuant to agreements with ourthird-party
 payment processors. These rules and requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governingelectronic
 funds transfers, are subject to change or reinterpretation, making it difficult for us to comply. Any failure to comply with these rules andcertification
 requirements  could  impact  our  ability  to  meet  our  contractual  obligations  to  our  third-party  payment  processors  and  could  result  inpotential
 fines. In addition, changes in these rules and requirements, including any change in our designation by major payment card providers,could
 require a change in our business operations and could result in limitations on or loss of our ability to accept payment cards or other forms ofpayment,
 any  of  which  could  negatively  impact  our  business.  Such  changes  could  also  increase  our  costs  of  compliance,  which  could  lead  toincreased fees for us or our sellers and adversely affect payments on our platform or usage of our payments services and Marketpl

 payments system is susceptible to illegal uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and payments to sanctioned parties.If
 our compliance program and internal controls to limit such illegal activity are ineffective, government authorities could bring legal action against usor otherwise suspend our ability to offer payment services in one or more markets.
We
 may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights and face ongoing allegations by third parties that we areinfringing their intellectual prop
erty rights.We
 believe the protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and tradesecrets,
 is critical to our success. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the UnitedStates
 and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rightswhen
 offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employeesand contractors and confidentiality agreements with p
arties with whom we conduct business.However,
 effective  intellectual  property  protection  may  not  be  available  in  every  country  in  which  our  products  and  services  are  madeavailable,
 and  contractual  arrangements  and  other  steps  we  have  taken  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  may  not  prevent  third  parties  frominfringing
 or  misappropriating  our  intellectual  property  or  deter  independent  development  of  equivalent  or  superior  intellectual  property  rights  byothers. Trademark,
 copyright, patent, domain name, trade dress and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation.We
 must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive andtime
 consuming and may not be successful in every jurisdiction. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorizeduse
 of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarksor
 copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Anyfailure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual pro
perty rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could materially harm our business.Additio
nally, we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. We are a defendant in various patent suits and havebeen notified of several other potential pate
nt disputes.As the number of
 patent owners and products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap, and aswe
 acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual propertyrights
 of  others  and  we  may  become  increasingly  subject  to  patent  suits  and  other  infringement  claims,  including  copyright,  and  trademarkinfringement
 claims. Such claims may be brought directly against us and/or against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we arecontractually
 obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming andcostly
 to  defend  and  resolve,  and  could  require  us  to  make  expensive  changes  in  our  methods  of  doing  business,  enter  into  costly  royalty  orlicensing
 agreements,  make  substantial  payments  to  satisfy  adverse  judgments  or  settle  claims  or  proceedings,  or  cease  conducting  certainoperations, which would
 harm our business.Failure
 to deal effectively with fraudulent activities on our platforms would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severelydiminish merchant and consumer confidence i
n and use of our services.We
 face reputational and other risks with respect to fraudulent activities on our platforms and periodically receive complaints from buyers andsellers
 who  may  not  have  received  the  goods  that  they  had  contracted  to  purchase  or  payment  for  the  goods  that  a  buyer  had  contracted  topurchase.
 In some European and Asian jurisdictions, buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within aspecified
 time period. While we can, in some cases, suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to otherusers,
 we  do  not  have  the  ability  to  require  users  to  make  payment  or  deliver  goods,  or  otherwise  make  users  whole  other  than  through  ourprotection
 programs.  Although  we  have  implemented  measures  to  detect  and  reduce  the  occurrence  of  fraudulent  activities,  combat  bad  buyerexperiences
 and  increase  buyer  satisfaction,  including  evaluating  sellers  on  the  basis  of  their  identity  and  transaction  history  and  restricting  orsuspending
 their activity, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in combating fraudulent transactions or improving overallsatisfaction
 among sellers, buyers, and other participants. Additional measures to address fraud could negatively affect the attractiveness of ourservices
 to  buyers  or  sellers,  resulting  in  a  reduction  in  the  ability  to  attract  new  users  or  retain  current  users,  damage  to  our  reputation,  or  adiminution in the value of our brand names.

Table of ContentsOur business is subject to online security risks, includin
g security breaches and cyberattacks.Our
 businesses involve the storage and transmission of users’ personal financial information. In addition, a significant number of our usersauthorize
 us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us or, in certain cases, third-party  serviceproviders
 utilized  in  our  payment  services.  An  increasing  number  of  websites,  including  those  owned  by  several  other  large  Internet  and  offlinecompanies,
 have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of theirwebsites
 or infrastructure. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security incidents and third partiesmay
 be able to access our users’ proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through our systems. Any securitybreach at a company providing services to us or our users could have simi
lar effects.We may also need 
to expend significant additional resources to protect against security breaches or to redress problems caused by breaches.Additionally,
 our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches and we may not be able to fullycollect, if at all, under these insurance policies.
Systems
 failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of or degradation in the performance of our websites, applications, products orservices could harm our business.
Our
 systems may experience service interruptions or degradation due to hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service
 and  other  cyberattacks,  human  error,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  floods,  fires,  natural  disasters,  power  losses,  disruptions  intelecommun
ications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, or other events. Our systems are also subject tobreak-ins,
 sabotage  and  intentional  acts  of  vandalism.  Some  of  our  systems  are  not  fully  redundant  and  our  disaster  recovery  planning  is  notsufficient for all eventualities.
We
 have  experienced  and  will  likely  continue  to  experience  system  failures,  denial-of-service  attacks,  human  error  and  other  events  orconditions
 from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce the speed or functionality of our websites and mobile applications, including ourpayments services.
 These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in thespeed or other functionality of
 our websites and mobile applications or payments services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistentinterruptions
 in  our  services  could  cause  current  or  potential  users  to  believe  that  our  systems  are  unreliable,  leading  them  to  switch  to  ourcompetitors
 or to avoid our sites, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similarevent
 results in damages to our customers or their businesses, these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses andthose claims,
 even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. We also rely on facilities, components and servicessupplied
 by  third  parties  and  our  business  may  be  materially  adversely  affected  to  the  extent  these  components  or  services  do  not  meet  ourexpectations
 or these third parties cease to provide the services or facilities. In particular, a decision by any of our third party hosting providers toclose a
 facility that we use could cause system interruptions and delays, result in loss of critical data and cause lengthy interruptions in our services.We do
 not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result ofsystems failures and similar events.
Our
 success largely depends on key employees. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain,and
 develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of senior management or other key employees could harm ourbusiness.
Our future performance depends substantia
lly on the continued services of our senior management and other key employees, including highlyskilled
 engineers and product developers, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate them. Competition for highly skilled individuals is intense,especially
 in the Silicon Valley where our corporate  headquarters  are located, and we may be unable to successfully  attract,  integrate  or retainsufficiently
 qualified  employees.  In  making  employment  decisions,  particularly  in  the  Internet  and  high-technology  industries,  employees  oftenconsider
 the value of their total compensation, including share-based awards such as restricted stock units, that they could receive in connectionwith
 their employment. In addition, our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse, welcoming andinclusive
 workplace. If our share-based or other compensation programs cease to be viewed as competitive, including due to fluctuations in ourstock price, or our workplace is not viewed as welcoming an
d inclusive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate19

s would be weakened, which could harm our business. We do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key employeesand
 do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key employees, orour inability to attract highly qualified sen
ior management and other key employees, could harm our business.Problems with or price increases by third parties who provide servic
es to us or to our sellers could harm our business.A
 number  of  third  parties  provide  services  to  us  or  to  our  sellers.  Such  services  include  seller  tools  that  automate  and  manage  listings,merchant
 tools  that  manage  listings  and  interface  with  inventory  management  software,  storefronts  that  help  our  sellers  list  items  and  shippingproviders
 that deliver goods sold on our platform, managed payments intermediation, among others. Financial or regulatory issues, labor issues(e.g.,
 strikes, lockouts, worker shortages or work stoppages), or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or oursellers could harm our business.
Price
 increases by, or service terminations, disruptions or interruptions at, companies that provide services to us and our sellers and clientscould
 also reduce the number of listings on our platforms  or make it more difficult for our sellers to complete transactions,  thereby harming ourbusiness.
 While we continue to work with global carriers to offer our sellers a variety of shipping options and to enhance their shipping experience,postal
 rate increases may reduce the competitiveness of certain sellers’ offerings, and postal service changes could require certain sellers to utilizealternatives
 which could be more expensive or inconvenient, which could in turn decrease the number of transactions on our sites, thereby harmingour business.
We
 have  outsourced  certain  functions  to  third-party  providers,  including  some  customer  support,  managed  payments  and  productdevelopment
 functions, which are critical to our operations. If our service providers do not perform satisfactorily, our operations could be disrupted,which could result in user dissatisfaction an
d could harm our business.There can be no
 assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our sellers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or atall.
 If any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our sellers on acceptable terms, including as a result of bankruptcy, we may beunable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner an
d on acceptable terms, or at all.Regulatory and Legal Risks
Our business is subject to extensive government regulatio
n and oversight, which could adversely impact our business.We
 are  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  affecting  our  domestic  and  international  operations  in  a  number  of  areas,  including  consumerprotection,
 data privacy requirements, intellectual property ownership and infringement, prohibited items and stolen goods, tax, antitrust and anti-competition,
 export  requirements,  anti-corruption,  labor,  advertising,  digital  content,  real  estate,  payments  and  financial  services,  billing,ecommerce/marketplace
 liability,  promotions,  quality  of  services,  telecommunications,  mobile  communications  and  media,  environmental,  andhealth
 and  safety  regulations,  as  well  as  laws  and  regulations  intended  to  combat  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorist  activities.  Inaddition,
 we are, or may become, subject to further regulation in some of the above-mentioned areas or new areas as a result of the continueddevelopment
 and expansion of our payments capabilities. Further, certain government agencies seek to hold us liable for third party sales on ourMarketplace
 platforms to the extent such sales implicate laws and regulations enforced by those agencies, including specifically the EnvironmentalProtection Agency and the Drug Enforcement Agency.
Compliance
 with these laws, regulations, and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and variances and inconsistencies fromjurisdict
ion to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result ofchanges in
 these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services less attractiveto
 our customers, delay the introduction of new products or services in one or more regions, or cause us to change or limit our business practices.We
 have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurancethat our customers, employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regul
ations or our policies and procedures. 20

Table of ContentsRegulation in the areas of privacy and protectio
n of user data could harm our business.We
 are subject to laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of personally identifiable information about our usersaround
 the  world.  Much  of  the  personal  information  that  we  collect,  especially  financial  information,  is  regulated  by  multiple  laws.  User  dataprotection
 laws  may  be  interpreted  and  applied  inconsistently  from  country  to  country.  In  many  cases,  these  laws  apply  not  only  to  third-partytransactions,
 but also to transfers of information between or among ourselves, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercialrelations. These laws continue to devel
op in ways we cannot predict and that may harm our business.Regulatory
 scrutiny  of  privacy,  user  data  protection,  use  of  data  and  data  collection  is  increasing  on  a  global  basis.  We  are  subject  to  anumber of
 privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and these laws and regulations will likely continue to evolveover
 time, both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions. In addition, compliance with these laws may restrict our ability toprovide
 services  to  our  customers  that  they  may  find  to  be  valuable.  For  example,  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (“GDPR”)  becameeffective
 in  May  2018.  The  GDPR,  which  applies  to  all  of  our  activities  conducted  from  an  establishment  in  the  European  Union  or  related  toproducts
 and services offered in the European Union, imposes a range of new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. TheGDPR
 imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and applythem.
 If we fail to comply with the GDPR, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the GDPR, it may lead to regulatory enforcementactions,
 which  can  result  in  monetary  penalties  of  up  to  4%  of  worldwide  revenue,  private  lawsuits,  or  reputational  damage.  In  June  2021,  theEuropea
n Commission finalized recommendations in relation to cross border data transfers and published new versions of the Standard ContractualClauses.
 The  new  requirements  will  require  us  to  incur  costs  and  expenses  in  order  to  comply  and  may  impact  the  transfer  of  personal  datathroughout our organization and to third parties.
In the U.S., California has adopted the California C
onsumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which became effective January 1, 2020 and whichprovides
 a  new  private  right  of  action  for  data  breaches  and  requires  companies  that  process  information  on  California  residents  to  make  newdisclosures
 to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with thirdparties.
 Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, which was passed in November 2020 and is fully effective in January 2023, significantly modifiesthe
 CCPA. These modifications will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our effort to comply. In addition to the CCPA, several otherU.S.
 states  have  adopted  or  are  considering  adopting  laws  and  regulations  imposing  obligations  regarding  the  handling  of  personal  data.Compliance with the GDPR, the
 CCPA, and other current and future applicable international and U.S. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can becostly
 and  time-consuming.  Complying  with  these  varying  national  and  international  requirements  could  cause  us  to  incur  substantial  costs  orrequire
 us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacy-related  laws can result in significantpenalties.
A
 determination that there have been violations of laws relating to our practices under communications-based laws could also expose us tosignific
ant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. In particular, becauseof
 the enormous number of texts, emails and other communications we send to our users, communications laws that provide a specified monetarydamage award or fine for each violation (such as those descri
bed below) could result in particularly large awards or fines.For
 example, the Federal Communications Commission amended certain of its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, orTCPA,
 in 2012 and 2013 in a manner that could increase our exposure to liability for certain types of telephonic communication with customers,including but not limited to text messages to mobile pho
nes. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500per violation, whichever is greater, and
 courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We are regularly subject to class-actionlawsuits,
 as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that our businesses violated the TCPA. These lawsuits, and other private lawsuits notcurrently
 alleged as class actions, seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the enormousnumber
 of  communications  we send to  our  users,  a determination  that  there  have been violations  of  the  TCPA or  other  communications-basedstatutes could expose us to significant damage aw
ards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.We
 post  on  our  websites  our  privacy  policies  and  practices  concerning  the  collection,  use  and  disclosure  of  user  data.  Any  failure,  orperceived
 failure,  by  us  to  comply  with  our  posted  privacy  policies  or  with  any  regulatory  requirements  or  orders  or  other  federal,  state  orinternational privacy or consumer protection-related la
ws and21

Table of Contentsregulations,
 including the GDPR and the CCPA, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (e.g., classaction
 privacy litigation), subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costsand adversely affect our business. Data collectio
n, privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern. If Internet and mobileusers
 were to reduce their use of our websites, mobile platforms, products, and services as a result of these concerns, or not consent to the use oftheir
 personal  information  for  certain  marketing  or  advertising  purposes,  our  business  could  be  harmed.  We  also  have  experienced  securitybreaches and likely will in the future, whic
h themselves may result in a violation of these laws.Other laws and regulations could harm our busin
ess.It
 is  not  always  clear  how  laws  and  regulations  governing  matters  relevant  to  our  business,  such  as  property  ownership,  copyrights,trademarks,
 and other intellectual property issues, parallel imports and distribution controls, taxation, libel and defamation, and obscenity apply toour
 businesses.  Many  of  these  laws were  adopted  prior  to  the  advent  of  the  Internet,  mobile,  and related  technologies  and,  as a result,  do notcontemplate
 or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Many of these laws, including some of those that do referencethe
 Internet are subject to interpretation by the courts on an ongoing basis and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these lawsand
 regulations  increases  the  risk  that  we  will  be  subject  to  private  claims  and  governmental  actions  alleging  violations  of  those  laws  andregulations.
As
 our activities, the products and services we offer, our investment in other companies, and our geographical scope continue to expand,regulatory
 agencies or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are subject to additional requirements (including licensure) or prohibited fromconducting
 our  business  in  their  jurisdiction,  either  generally  or  with  respect  to  certain  actions.  For  example,  we  have  the  ability  to  acquireinvestments in other
 companies (such as Adevinta, Adyen, KakaoBank and Gmarket, formerly known as Apollo Korea) that raise the potential for usto
 be deemed an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). While we intend toconduct
 our operations such that we will not be deemed an investment company, such a determination would require us to initiate burdensomecompliance requirements and comply with restrictions impos
ed by the Investment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations onour
 capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Further, financial andpolitical
 events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on large companies, and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws andregulations differently than they have in the past and i
n a manner adverse to our businesses.Numerous
 U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions, including the State of California, have regulations regarding “auctions” and the handling ofproperty
 by “secondhand dealers” or “pawnbrokers.” Several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted to impose such regulations uponus
 or our users, and others may attempt to do so in the future. Attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users appears to beincreasing
 and we could be required to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues, such asforcing us
 to prohibit listings of certain items or restrict certain listing formats in some locations. We could also be subject to fines or other penalties,and any of these outcomes could harm our business.
As
 we expand and localize our international activities, we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries ormarkets
 in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services tousers worldwi
de, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our serversor
 one or more of our users, or the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction. Laws regulating Internet,mobile
 and ecommerce technologies outside of the United States are generally less favorable to us than those in the United States. Compliancemay
 be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings, and the imposition of any regulations on usor
 our  users  may  harm  our  business.  In  addition,  we may  be  subject  to  multiple  overlapping  legal or  regulatory  regimes  that  impose  conflictingrequirements
 on us (e.g., in cross-border trade). Our alleged failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminalprosecution to significant fines to bans on our services, in ad
dition to the significant costs we may incur in defending against such actions.We are regularly subject to general litigation, regu
latory disputes, and government inquiries.We
 are  regularly  subject  to  claims,  lawsuits  (including  class  actions  and  individual  lawsuits),  government  investigations,  and  otherproceedings involving comp
etition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, consumer22

 accessibility  claims,  securities,  tax,  labor  and employment,  commercial  disputes,  content  generated  by our  users,  services  and othermatters.
 The  number  and  significance  of  these  disputes  and  inquiries  have  increased  as  our  Company  has  grown  larger,  our  businesses  haveexpanded in scope and ge
ographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity. As the global regulatory and legal landscapeevolves,
 we may also become subject to product liability claims when products sold by third parties using our platforms result in personal injury, orillness, or death or injury to property.
The
 outcome  and  impact  of  such  claims,  lawsuits,  government  investigations,  and  other  proceedings  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.Regardless
 of  the  outcome,  such  investigations  and  proceedings  can  have  an  adverse  impact  on  us  because  of  legal  costs,  diversion  ofmanagement
 resources,  and  other  factors.  Determining  reserves  for  our  pending  litigation  and  other  proceedings  is  a  complex,  fact-intensiveprocess
 that  is  subject  to  judgment  calls.  It  is  possible  that  a  resolution  of  one  or  more  such  proceedings  could  require  us  to  make  substantialpayments to satisfy judgments,
 fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could harm our business. These proceedings couldalso result
 in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products, or services, or requiringa
 change in our business practices in costly ways, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any ofthese consequences could
 harm our business.We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competitio
n laws that could adversely impact our business.We
 are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competitionlaws.
 Some  jurisdictions  also  provide  private  rights  of  action  for  competitors  or  consumers  to  assert  claims  of  anti-competitive  conduct.  Othercompanies
 and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of theUnited
 States,  individual  states,  the  European  Union  or  other  countries,  or  otherwise  constitute  unfair  competition.  An  increasing  number  ofgovernments
 are regulating competition law activities, including increased scrutiny in large markets such as China. Our business partnerships oragreements
 or  arrangements  with  customers  or  other  companies  could  give  rise  to  regulatory  action  or  antitrust  litigation.  Some  regulators,particularly
 those outside of the United States, may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practicescould
 be deemed anticompetitive. Certain competition authorities have conducted market studies of our industries. Such claims and investigations,even if
 without foundation, may be very expensive to defend, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort andcould result in significant judgments ag
ainst us or require us to change our business practices.The listing or sale by
 our users of certain items, including items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners, includingpirated or counterfeit items, illegal items or items used in an illega
l manner may harm our business.The
 listing  or  sale  by  our  users  of  unlawful,  counterfeit  or  stolen  goods  or  unlawful  services,  or  sale  of  goods  or  services  in  an  unlawfulmanner,
 has resulted and may continue to result in allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities against us (including the employeesand
 directors  of  our  various  entities)  involving  activities  carried  out  by  users  through  our  services.  In  a  number  of  circumstances,  third  parties,including
 government regulators and law enforcement officials, have alleged that our services aid and abet violations of certain laws, including lawsregarding
 the sale of counterfeit items, laws restricting or prohibiting the transferability (and by extension, the resale) of digital goods (e.g., books,music
 and software), the fencing of stolen goods, selective distribution channel laws, customs laws, distance selling laws, and the sale of itemsoutside of the United States that are regulated by U.S. export controls.
In
 addition, allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights, including but not limited to counterfeit items, have resulted in threatenedand
 actual litigation from time to time by rights owners. These and similar suits may also force us to modify our business practices in a manner thatincreases
 costs,  lowers  revenue,  makes  our  websites  and  mobile  platforms  less  convenient  to  customers,  and  requires  us  to  spend  substantialresources
 to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings in order to combat these practices. In addition, we havereceived
 significant media attention relating to the listing or sale of illegal or counterfeit goods, which could damage our reputation, diminish thevalue of our brand names, and make users reluctant to use our products and services.

Table of ContentsRecently,
 we received requests for information from government agencies related to our potential liability for products sold by sellers on ourMarketplace
 platforms. We have responded to inquiries from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding products sold on our Marketplace platformsalleged to violate
 certain laws and regulations, including regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency and, separately, regulations of the DrugEnforcement
 Agency. If we are found to be liable for such activities on our Marketplace, we could be subject to monetary damages, changes in ourbusiness practices, or other remedies that could have a material adverse imp
act on our business.We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated throug
h our services.Online
 services  companies  may  be  subject  to  claims  relating  to  information  disseminated  through  their  services,  including  claims  allegingdefamation,
 libel, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating tothe
 liability of online services companies for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the UnitedStates and
 foreign jurisdictions. Any liabilities incurred as a result of these matters could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputationand our business.
Our potential liability to third parties for the user-provided content on our sites, particul
arly in jurisdictions outside the United States where lawsgoverning
 Internet transactions are unsettled, may increase. If we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service inany
 jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to thisliability, including exp
ending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings, which could harm our business.Interest Rate and Indebtedness Risks
Fluctuations in interest rates, and changes in regul
atory guidance related to such interest rates, could adversely impact our financial results.Investments in both fixed-rate
 and floating-rate interest-earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value ofour
 fixed-rate  investment  securities  may  be  adversely  impacted  due  to  a  rise  in  interest  rates.  In  addition,  relatively  low  interest  rates  limit  ourinvestment income.
We
 have substantial indebtedness, and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, and we may not generate sufficientcash flow
 from our business to service our indebtedness. Failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in the acceleration of ourindebtedness, which could h
ave an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity.We
 have  a  substantial  amount  of  outstanding  indebtedness  and  we  may  incur  substantial  additional  indebtedness  in  the  future,  includingunder
 our  commercial  paper  program  and  revolving  credit  facility  or  through  public  or  private  offerings  of  debt  securities.  Our  outstandingindebtedness and any add
itional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including, without limitation, any of the following:

requiring  us to use a significant  portion  of our cash flow from  operations  and other  available cash to service  our indebtedness,  therebyreducing the amount of cash available for other purpos
es, including capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions;•
our  indebtedness  and  leverage  may  increase  our  vulnerability  to  downturns  in  our  business,  to  competitive  pressures,  and  to  adversechanges in general economic a
nd industry conditions;•
adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies will likely increase our borrowing costs;•
our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends or other generalcorporate and other purposes may be limited; and
•
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.24

Table of ContentsTax Risks
Our
 business and our sellers and buyers may be subject to evolving sales and other tax regimes in various jurisdictions, which may harm ourbusiness.
The
 application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax, value-added tax (“VAT”), goods and services tax (“GST”) (including the “digitalservices tax”), business tax, withholdi
ng tax and gross receipt tax, and tax information reporting obligations to businesses like ours and to our sellersand
 buyers is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before theadoption
 and growth of the Internet and ecommerce. Significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amountsrecorded
 are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear when andhow
 new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to our sellers’ businesses. In some cases it may be difficult or impossible for us tovalidate
 information provided to us by our sellers on which we must rely to ascertain any obligations that may apply to us related to our sellers’businesses,
 given  the  intricate  nature  of  these  regulations  as  they  apply  to  particular  products  or  services  and  that  many  of  the  products  andservices
 sold  in  our  marketplace  are  unique  or  handmade.  If  we  are  found  to  be  deficient  in  how  we  have  addressed  our  tax  obligations,  ourbusiness could be adver
sely impacted.From
 time to time, some taxing authorities in the United States have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes imposed on ourservices.
 These notifications have not resulted in any significant tax liabilities to date, but there is a risk that some jurisdiction may be successful inthe
 future,  which  would  harm  our  business.  While  we  attempt  to  comply  in  those  jurisdictions  where  it  is  clear  that  a  tax  is  due,  some  of  oursubsidiaries
 have, from time to time, received claims relating to the applicability of indirect taxes to our fees. Additionally, we pay input VAT onapplicable
 taxable purchases within the various countries in which we operate. In most cases, we are entitled to reclaim this input VAT from thevarious
 countries. However, because of our unique business model, the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimesuncertain. A successful assertion by one or more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim VAT co
uld harm our business.Various
 jurisdictions  are  seeking  to,  or  have  recently  imposed  additional  reporting,  record-keeping,  indirect  tax  collection  and  remittanceobligations,
 or  revenue-based  taxes  on  businesses  like  ours  that  facilitate  online  commerce.  If  requirements  like  these  become  applicable  inadditional
 jurisdictions, our business, collectively with eBay sellers’ businesses, could be harmed. For example, taxing authorities in the U.S. and inother
 countries have targeted e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate, collect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over theinternet,
 and have enacted laws and others are considering similar legislation. With two additional states adopting Internet sales tax laws in 2021,some
 buyers across the U.S. encountered sales tax for the first time on eBay. To date, 45 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico haveenacted
 Internet sales tax legislation. Additionally, a digital service tax (DST) was implemented in Spain in 2021, and we are complying with thelegislation.
 Our business will also be required to increase payments reporting requirements for US sellers as a result of federal legislation. Startingon
 January 1, 2022, all businesses that process payments are required to issue a Form 1099-K for all sellers who receive $600 or more in sales, adecrease
 from the previous reporting threshold of $20,000 and 200 transactions. Form 1099-Ks for the new thresholds will be issued in January2023. Tax collection responsibility and the additional costs
 associated with complex sales and use tax collection, remittance and audit requirements,or reporting, could create additional burde
ns for buyers and sellers on our websites and mobile platforms.These
 legislative changes or new legislation could adversely affect our business if the requirement of tax to be charged on items sold on ourmarketplac
es causes our marketplaces to be less attractive to current and prospective buyers, which could materially impact our business and eBaysellers’
 businesses. This legislation could also require us or our sellers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated withtax calculation, collection, remittance, and audit requ
irements, which could make selling on our marketplaces less attractive.25

Table of ContentsWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabil
ities.The
 determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and therecan be
 from time to time transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations,we
 are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Our determinationof our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreig
n tax authorities, and we are currently undergoing a numberof
 investigations,  audits  and  reviews  by  taxing  authorities  throughout  the  world,  including  with  respect  to  our  business  structure.  Any  adverseoutcome
 of any such audit or review could harm our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financialstatements
 and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. While we have establishedreserves
 based  on  assumptions  and  estimates  that  we  believe  are  reasonable  to  cover  such  eventualities,  these  reserves  may  prove  to  beinsufficient.
In
 addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by a shift in our jurisdictional earning mix, by changes in the valuation of ourdeferred
 tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, oraccounting principles, as well as certai
n discrete items.Transactional Risks
Acquisitions,
 dispositions, joint ventures, strategic partnerships and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties and could harmour business or impact our financial results.
We
 have  acquired  a  significant  number  of  businesses  of  varying  size  and  scope,  technologies,  services,  and  products,  and  we  maintaininvestments in certain busine
sses. We have also disposed of significant businesses. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array ofpotential
 strategic  transactions  as  part  of  our  overall  business  strategy,  including  business  combinations,  acquisitions,  and  dispositions  ofbusinesses, technologies, services, products, and oth
er assets, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures.These transactions may involve significant cha
llenges and risks, including:•
the  potential  loss  of  key  customers,  merchants,  vendors  and  other  key  business  partners  of  the  companies  we  acquire,  or  dispose  of,following and continui
ng after announcement of our transaction plans;•
declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result fromchanges
 in compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the acquired or disposedbusiness;
•
difficulty making new and strategic hires of new employees;•
diversion  of  management  time  and  a  shift  of  focus  from  operating  the  businesses  to  the  transaction,  and  in  the  case  of  an  acquisition,integration and administration;
•
the need to provide transition services to a disposed of company, which may result in the diversion of resources and focus;•
the need to integrate the operations, systems (including accounting, management, information, human resource and other administrativesystems),
 technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costlyprocess;
•
the  inefficiencies  and  lack  of  control  that  may  result  if  such  integration  is  delayed  or  not  implemented,  and  unforeseen  difficulties  andexpenditures that may arise as a result;
•
the  need  to  implement  or  improve  controls,  procedures  and  policies  appropriate  for  a  larger  public  company  at  companies  that  prior  toacquisition
 may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies or whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicablelegal and other standards;
•
risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•
derivative lawsuits resulting from the acquisition or disposition;•
liability for activities of the acquired or disposed of company before the transaction, including intellectual property and other litigation claimsor
 disputes, violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities and, in thecase
 of dispositions, liabilities to the acquirors of those businesses under contractual provisions such as representations, warranties andindemnities;
•
the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;26

Table of Contents•
the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information by us or a third party acquiring assets or businesses from us, which inand of itself may require regulatory approval and or additi
onal controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure;•
any fluctuations in share prices, financial results and fluctuations in exchange rates, and our ability to sell our shares in any company wehave invested in; and
•
our dependence on the acquired business’ accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processesand
 the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our consolidated financial statementsor make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.
    
We have
 made certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and/or lack management andoperatio
nal control. The controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent withours, and
 business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm toour reputation or adversely affect
 the value of our investment in the joint venture. Any circumstances, which may be out of our control, that adverselyaffect
 the value of our investments, or cost resulting from regulatory action or lawsuits in connection with our investments, could harm our businessor negatively impact our financial results.
We
 entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen that entitles us to acquire a fixed number ofshares of
 Adyen’s common stock subject to certain milestones being met. This warrant is accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASC Topic815, 
Derivatives  and Hedging.  Changes in Adyen’s common stock price and equity volatility has had, and may continue to have in the future, asignificant
 impact on the value of this warrant. We report this warrant on a quarterly basis at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, andchanges
 in the fair value of this warrant are recognized in our consolidated statement of income. Fluctuations in Adyen’s common stock price andprevaili
ng foreign exchange rate or other changes in assumptions could result in material changes in the fair value that we report in our consolidatedbalance sheets and our consoli
dated statement of income, which could have a material impact on our financial results.Upon closing of the transaction to transfer the Classifieds busi
ness, we received approximately 540 million Adevinta shares, a portion of whichwas later sold
 to Permira. Fluctuations in Adevinta’s share price, financial results and fluctuations in exchange rates could result in material changesin
 our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of income. In addition, our ability to sell our Adevinta shares in the future will besubject to market conditions and other factors which could impact the valu
e we are able to realize from any such sales.We could incur significant liabil
ity if the Distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction.We
 have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that our distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPalto
 our stockholders on July 17, 2015 (the “Distribution”) qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the InternalRevenue
 Code. The opinion relies  on certain  facts,  assumptions,  representations  and undertakings  from  PayPal and us regarding  the past  andfuture
 conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings areincorrect
 or not satisfied, our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant taxliabilities.
 Notwithstanding  the  opinion  of  tax  counsel  we  have  received,  the  IRS  could  determine  on  audit  that  the  Distribution  is  taxable  if  itdetermines
 that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with theconclusions
 in the opinion. If the Distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders that are subject toU.S. federal income tax and we could incur signific
ant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.We may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a resu
lt of the Distribution.We
 entered  into  a  separation  and  distribution  agreement  and  various  other  agreements  with  PayPal  to  govern  the  Distribution  and  therelationship
 of the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between usand
 PayPal.  The indemnity  rights  we have against PayPal under  the agreements  may  not be sufficient  to  protect  us. In addition,  our indemnityobligations to PayPal may be sign
ificant and these risks could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.27

In  October  2021,  we  entered  into  accelerated  share  repurchase  agreements  (the  “2021  ASR  Agreements”)  with  two  financial  institutions  (each,  a  “2021  ASRCounterparty
”), as part of our share repurchase program. Under the 2021 ASR Agreements, we paid an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion to the 2021 ASR Counterpartiesand
 received  an  initial  delivery  of  approximately  29.3  million  shares  of  our  common  stock.  In  December  2021,  the  2021  ASR  Agreement  with  one  of  the  2021  ASRCounterparties
 settled and resulted in a delivery of approximately 3.4 million additional shares of our common stock. In January 2022, the 2021 ASR Agreement with theremaining
 2021 ASR Counterparty settled and resulted in a delivery of approximately 3.3 million additional shares. In total under the 2021 ASR Repurchase Agreements,approximately 36.0 million shares were repurchased at an average price per share of $69.43.

In  January  2020  our  Board  authorized  an  additional  $5  billion  stock  repurchase  program,  in  February  2021  our  Board  authorized  an  additional  $4.0  billion  stockrepurchase
 program and in August 2021 our Board authorized an additional $3.0 billion stock repurchase program. These stock repurchase programs have no expirationfrom the date of authorization. In February 2022 our Board authorized an additional $4.0 billion stock repurchase program.
Our
 stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditionsand
 other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under ourstock
 repurchase  programs  may  be  made  through  open  market  transactions,  block  trades,  privately  negotiated  transactions  (including  accelerated  share  repurchasetransactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.
During

We
 expect, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock. However, ourstock
 repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety offactors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.

OVERVIEW
 
Business
eBay
 Inc., is a global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace platforms. Founded in 1995 in San Jose, California, eBay is one ofthe
 world’s largest and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection. Collectively, we connect millions of buyers andsellers
 around the world, empowering people and creating opportunity. Our technologies and services are designed to provide buyers choice and abreadth
 of relevant inventory and to enable sellers worldwide to organize and offer their inventory for sale, virtually anytime and anywhere. In 2021,eBay enabled $87 bil
lion of Gross Merchandise Volume.In
 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and its variants as a pandemic which continuesto
 be  widespread  with  uncertainty  around  its  duration.  As  a  result  of  COVID-19  mobility  restrictions  globally,  there  were  changes  in  consumerbehavior
 that have resulted in more online shopping beginning in 2020 and extending into 2021. Our Marketplace platforms experienced improvedtraffic,
 acquisition of small business sellers and buyer acquisition due to the impacts of measures taken globally to contain the spread of COVID-19.These
 changes  in  behavior  began  to  normalize  as  mobility  trended  toward  pre-pandemic  levels  through  the  remainder  of  2021,  and  we  haveexperien
ced lower traffic in most markets which we expect to continue into 2022. The impacts seen to date continue to create volatility in our resultsand
 a wider range of potential outcomes as consumer behaviors and mobility restrictions continue to evolve. See “Results  of Operations” below  forimpacts
 of  COVID-19  on  our  results  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  compared  to  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020.  For  additionalinformation,
 see “–  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resource  Requirements” below  and  “Item  1A:  Risk  Factors”  under  the  caption  “The  global  COVID-19pandemic could harm our business and resu
lts of operations” in Part II of this report.On
 November 14, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of 80.01% of the outstanding equity interests of eBay Korea LLC, alimited liability
 company incorporated under the laws of Korea and a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay KTA (“eBay Korea”) to E-mart Inc. and one ofits
 wholly  owned  subsidiaries  (together,  “Emart”),  pursuant  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  securities  purchase  agreement,  in  exchange  forapproximately
 $3.0 billion of gross cash proceeds as of the transaction close date, subject to certain adjustments specified for indebtedness, cash,working
 capital,  transaction  expenses  and  certain  taxes.  The  sale  resulted  in  a  pre-tax  gain  of  $3.2  billion  inclusive  of  a  $81  million  currencytranslation
 adjustment and a $44 million gain net of tax on the net investment hedge settled in the fourth quarter of 2021, and related income taxexpense of $369 million. Upon

n of the sale, we retained 19.99% of the outstanding equity interests of the new entity, Gmarket Global LLC (“Gmarket”) formerly known asApollo Korea, which is accounte
d for under the fair value option.On June 24, 2021, we completed the previously an
nounced transfer of our Classifieds business to Adevinta ASA (“Adevinta”) for $2.5 billion incash
 proceeds,  subject  to  certain  adjustments,  and  approximately  540  million  shares  in  Adevinta  which  represent  an  equity  interest  of  44%,comprised
 of approximately  33% of  voting shares  and 11% of  non-voting  shares.  Together,  the total  consideration  received  under the  definitiveagreement
 was  valued  at  approximately  $13.3  billion,  based  on  the  closing  trading  price  of  Adevinta’s  outstanding  shares  on  the  Oslo  StockExchange
 on June 24, 2021. The equity interest received is accounted for under the fair value option. On November 18, 2021, we completed thepreviously
 announced sale of approximately 135 million of our voting shares in Adevinta to Astinlux Finco S.à r.l. (“Permira”), inclusive of the optionexercised
 by Permira to purchase additional voting shares, for approximately $2.3 billion in cash proceeds. At the close of the sale inclusive of theoption exercised, our ownership in Ad
evinta was reduced to 33%.On
 February 13, 2020, we closed the previously announced sale of our StubHub business to an affiliate of viagogo. Beginning in the firstquarter of 2020, StubHub’s financial results 
for periods prior to the sale have been reflected in our consolidated statement of income as discontinuedoperations.
 Additionally,  the  related  assets  and  liabilities  associated  with  the  discontinued  operations  in  the  prior  periods  are  classified  asdiscontinued operations in o
ur consolidated balance sheet.We
 have classified the related assets and liabilities associated with our eBay Korea and Classifieds businesses  as discontinued operations inour
 consolidated  balance  sheet.  The  results  of  our  eBay  Korea,  Classifieds  and  StubHub  businesses  have  been  presented  as  discontinuedoperations
 in  our  consolidated  statement  of  income  for  all  periods  presented  through  the  respective  transaction  close  dates  as  the  transactionsrepresented a strategic shift in our business that had a major effect on our operations an

In addition to
 the corresponding measures under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management uses non-GAAP measuresin reviewing our financial results.
 The foreign exchange neutral (“FX-Neutral”), or constant currency, net revenue amounts discussed below are non-GAAP
 financial measures and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the FX-Neutral
 information appearing in the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information providedbelow
 in  “Non-GAAP  Measures  of  Financial  Performance,”  which  includes  reconciliations  of  FX-Neutral  financial  measures  to  the  most  directlycomparable

Table of ContentsFiscal Year Highlights
During
 2021, we completed the migration of eBay’s managed payments in all markets, delivering buyers and sellers a simplified end-to-endpayments
 experience. Net revenues increased 17% to $10.4 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the migration of managed paymentson
 a global basis and the associated higher take rate. Transaction take rate was higher in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of revenue initiativessuch
 as  global  payments  and  Promoted  Listings,  which  along  with  final  value  fees  are  calculated  as  a  percentage  of  an  item’s  sale  price  andcategory
 mix. FX-Neutral net revenue (as defined above) increased 15% in 2021 compared to 2020. Operating margin decreased to 28.1% in 2021compared to 29.6% in 2020.
On
 November  14,  2021,  we  completed  the  sale  of  80.01%  of  the  outstanding  equity  interests  of  eBay  Korea  to  Emart  for  approximately$3.0 billion of gross cash proceeds. 
We retained 19.99% of the outstanding equity interests of the new entity, Gmarket, which is accounted for underthe fair value option.
On
 June 24, 2021, the transfer of our Classifieds business was completed for $13.3 billion of consideration which comprised of $2.5 billion inproceeds
 and shares of Adevinta valued at $10.8 billion. On November 18, 2021, we completed the sale of approximately 135 million of our votingshares in Adevinta to Permira for approximately $2.3 billi
on in proceeds. At the close of the sale our ownership in Adevinta was reduced to 33%.We generated cash flow from
 continuing operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2021 compared to $3.0 billion in 2020, ending the year with cash,cash equivalents and non-eq

We
 have  one  reportable  segment  to  reflect  the  way  management  and  our  chief  operating  decision  maker  (“CODM”)  review  and  assessperformance of
 the business. Our reportable segment is Marketplace, which includes our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localizedcounterparts

Seasonality
We
 expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to trend with general consumer buying patterns and expect that these trends willcontinue.
 As  we  introduce  new  products  and  platforms,  such  as  managed  payments,  we  expect  net  revenues  to  fluctuate.  In  addition,macroeconomic
 conditions, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may also contribute to fluctuations in revenues and margins. The followingtable

Net Revenues by Geography
Revenues
 are attributed to U.S. and international geographies primarily based upon the country in which the seller, platform that displaysadvertising,
 other service provider or customer, as the case may be, is located. The following table presents net revenues by geography for theperiods indicated (in millions, exce

 commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British poundand euro.
 In addition, as shown in the table above, we generate approximately half of our net revenues internationally. Because of these factors, weare subject to the risks related to doing business in foreign co
untries as discussed under “Item 1A: Risk Factors” in Part I of this report.Net
 revenues included $65 million of hedging losses during 2021 and $15 million and $81 million of hedging gains during 2020 and 2019,respectively. The
 hedging activity in net revenues specifically relates to hedges of net transaction revenues. Foreign currency movements relative tothe U.S. dollar had a favorable impact of $188 million

Table of Contentsand
 $26 million on net revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and an unfavorable impact of $85 million on net revenues in 2019. The effect offoreign
 currency exchange rate movements in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily attributable to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against theBritish pound and euro.
Net Revenues by Type
We generate two types of net revenues:
Net
 transaction revenues primarily  include final value fees, feature fees, including fees to promote listings and listing fees fromsellers
 on our platforms. Our net transaction revenues also include store subscription and other fees often from large enterprisesellers.
 Our  net  transaction  revenues  are  reduced  by  incentives,  including  discounts,  coupons  and  rewards,  provided  to  ourcustomers.
Marketing
 services  and  other  ("MS&O") revenues consist  of  revenues  principally  from  the  sale  of  revenue  sharingarrangements and advertisements.

Key Operating Metrics
Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) and take rate are significant factors that we believe affect our net transaction revenues.
GMV
 consists  of the total value of all paid transactions between users on our platforms during the applicable period inclusive ofshipping
 fees and taxes. Despite GMV’s divergence from revenue, we still believe that GMV provides a useful measure of theoverall volume of paid transactions that flow through our pl
atforms in a given period.Take
 rate is  defined as net transaction revenues divided by GMV and represents net transaction revenue as a percentage ofoverall
 volume on our platforms. We believe that take rate provides a useful measure of our ability to monetize volume throughmarketplace services on our platforms in a given period. We use take rate to identify key revenue driv
ers on our marketplace.Net Transaction Revenues

Table of ContentsDuring
 2021, we completed the migration of eBay’s managed payments in all markets, delivering buyers and sellers a simplified end-to-endpayments
 experience.  Net  transaction  revenues  increased  $1.5  billion  in  2021  compared  to  2020  primarily  due  to  the  migration  of  managedpayments
 on  a  global  basis  and  the  associated  higher  take  rate  as  well  as  the  growth  of  Promoted  Listings.  GMV  was  relatively  flat  in  2021compared
 to 2020 due to improved traffic and buyer acquisition during the first quarter of 2021 offset by a decline in traffic experienced for theremainder
 of 2021. Traffic has fluctuated throughout 2021 and 2020 in response to the pervasive macroeconomic impacts of COVID-19, includingmobility
 restrictions which influence consumer engagement in online shopping. GMV in both 2021 and 2020 was elevated compared to 2019 asimproved
 business  dynamics  influenced  growth  across  all  major  product  categories.  While  GMV  growth  rates  were  relatively  flat  across  manycategories
 in 2021 compared to 2020, market trends influenced stronger contributions from the collectibles category in 2021 compared to 2020,particularly in the U.S.
Transaction
 take rate was higher in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of revenue initiatives such as global payments which resulted in themajority of global on-platform volume processed through mana
ged payments and Promoted Listings, which along with final value fees are calculatedas a percentage of an item’s sale price and category mix.
The
 increase in net transaction revenues in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to take rate considerations discussed above, despite relativelyflat
 GMV. We expect that the divergence between net transaction revenues and GMV to continue into 2022. Despite GMV’s divergence from nettransaction
 revenues, we still believe the metric provides a useful measure of overall volume of paid transactions that flow through the platform in agiven period.

Cost
 of net revenues represents costs associated with customer support, site operations and payment processing. Significant components ofthese
 costs  primarily  consist  of  employee  compensation  including  stock-based  compensation,  contractor  costs,  facilities  costs,  depreciation  ofequipment
 and amortization expense, bank transaction fees, credit card interchange and assessment fees, authentication costs and digital servicestax. The following table presents cost of net revenues for the periods ind

in operating expenses.Sales and Marketing
 
Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and marketing program costs (both online and offline), employee compensation
including
 stock-based  compensation,  certain user coupons and rewards,  contractor  costs,  facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. Onlinemarketing
 expenses represent traffic acquisition costs in various channels such as paid search, affiliates marketing and display advertising. Offlineadvertising primarily includes brand camp
aigns and buyer/seller communications.The
 increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to increases of $84 million in online advertisingexpenses,
 $37  million  in  employee  compensation  and  $25  million  in  executive  severance  costs.  These  increases  were  offset  by  a  decrease  of$78 million in certain
 coupons and rewards.Product Development
 
Product
 development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation including stock-based compensation, contractor costs, facilitiescosts
 and  depreciation  on  equipment.  Product  development  expenses  are  net  of  required  capitalization  of  major  platform  and  other  productdevelopment
 efforts,  including  the  development  and  maintenance  of  our  technology  platform.  Our  top  technology  priorities  include  paymentintermedi
ation capabilities, products to grow the seller tools ecosystem and product experiences that delight our customers and enhance the buyingexperience for our enthusiasts.
The
 increase in product development expenses in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to increases of $227 million in employee relatedcosts.
 Capitalized internal use and platform development costs were $127 million and $129 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are primarilyreflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods.
General and Administrative
 
General
 and  administrative  expenses  primarily  consist  of  employee  compensation  including  stock-based  compensation,  contractor  costs,facilities
 costs, depreciation of equipment, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, legal expenses, restructuring, insurance premiumsand
 professional fees. Our legal expenses, including those related to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period toperiod.
The decrease in general and admi
nistrative expenses in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the absence of costs related to our CEOtransition in 2020 of $33 million an
d a decrease in charitable contributions of approximately $36 million.37

Table of ContentsProvision for Transaction Losses
Provision
 for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our buyer protection programs, losses from ourmanaged payments services, fraud and
 bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance. We expect our provision for transactionlosses to fluctuate depending on many factors, includ
ing changes to our protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes.The
 increase in provision for transaction losses in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to higher chargeback lossesof
 $81  million  incurred  for  managed  payments  as  we  scaled  the  platform  and  higher  customer  protection  program  costs  of  $63  million.  Theseincreases
 were  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  bad  debt  expense  of  $52  million  as  a  result  of  fees  collected  through  the  managed  paymentsplatform.
Gain (Loss) on Equity Investments and Warrant, net
 
Gain
 (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net primarily consists of gains and losses related to our various types of equity investments,includi
ng our equity investments in Adevinta, KakaoBank and Adyen, and gains and losses due to changes in fair value of the warrant received fromAdyen. The following table prese

Gain  (loss) on other investments primarily included: (i) in 2021, primarily a $41 million upward adjustment and a $10 million impairment recorded on equity investmentswithout
 readily determinable fair values; (ii) in 2020, primarily a $40 million impairment recorded on an investment and a $37 million gain for the receipt of proceeds thatwere held in escrow related to a long-term investment that was sold in 2018.

The
 decrease in gain (loss) on equity method investments and warrant, net in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by a $3.1 billionloss
 from the change in fair value of our equity investment in Adevinta, a $160 million impairment recorded on our equity investment in Paytm Malland
 a $416 million change in the gain related to the Adyen warrant. These decreases were partially offset by a $164 million change in unrealizedgain related to our equity investment in KakaoB

 increase in our effective tax rate in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to non-deductible losses on investments, partially offset bya benefit from the release of a valuation allowanc
e. The effective tax rate in 2020 included the effects of a retroactive California law change includingincremental taxes on the gain on the sale of StubHu
b, partially offset by an increased tax benefit from stock-based compensation.We
 are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally. We believe that adequate amounts have beenreserved
 for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given theinherent
 uncertainties in these examinations. Due to the ongoing tax examinations, it is generally impractical to determine the amount and timing ofthese
 adjustments. However, we expect several tax examinations to close within the next twelve months. See “Note 15 — Income Taxes” to theconsolidated financial statements inc
luded in this report for more information on estimated settlements within the next twelve months.Discontinued Operations

 Additionally,  the  related  assets  and  liabilities  associated  with  the  discontinued  operations  in  the  prior  periods  are  classified  asdiscontinued operations in o

lidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance
To
 supplement  our  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  use  FX-Neutral
 net revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing our financialresults.
 We define FX-Neutral net revenues as net revenues minus the exchange rate effect. We define exchange rate effect as the year-over-yearimpact
 of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts, excludinghedging activity.
These
 non-GAAP  measures  are  not  in  accordance  with,  or  an  alternative  to,  measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP  and  may  bedifferent
 from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set ofaccounting
 rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results ofoperations
 as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction withthe corresponding GAAP measures.
These
 non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospectsfor
 the future. Specifically, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding theforeign
 currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because we havehistorically
 reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provide consistency in ourfinancial reporting.

Continuing Operating Activities
Our
 operating  cash  flows  arise  primarily  from  cash  received  from  our  customers  on  our  platforms  offset  by  cash  payments  for  sales  andmarketing, employee compensation and payme
nt processing expenses.Cash
 provided  by  continuing  operating  activities  of  $3.1  billion  in  2021  compared  to  $3.0  billion  in  2020  was  primarily  attributable  to  anincrease
 in operating income from continuing operations of $287 million. The increase in operating income from continuing operations was primarilydue to
 an increase in revenues, primarily as a result of the migration of managed payments on a global basis and the associated higher take rate asnoted
 in our comments in “Net Transaction Revenues.” The remaining changes in continuing operating cash flows were attributable to changes innon-cash
 items and favorable working capital movements due to lower accounts receivable from the migration to managed payments and loweraccrued liabilities.
Continuing Investing Activities
Cash used
 in investing activities of $1.4 billion in 2021 was primarily attributable to purchases of investments of $22.2 billion and property andequipment
 of  $444 million.  These  purchases  were  partially  offset  by  proceeds  of  $18.9  billion from  the  maturities  and  sales  of  investments  and$2.3 billion from the sale of approximately 135 mill
ion of our voting shares in Adevinta.Cash used in
 investing activities of $0.2 billion in 2020 was primarily attributable to cash paid for purchases of investments of $32.9 billion andproperty and equipment of $463 million, offset by proceeds of $3
3.1 billion from the maturities and sales of investments.The
 largely  offsetting  effects  of  purchases  of  investments  and  maturities  and  sale  of  investments  results  from  the  management  of  ourinvestments. As our immediate cash needs change, purchase a

 in financing activities of $6.6 billion in 2021 was primarily driven by common stock repurchases of $7.1 billion, of which $2.5 billionrelated
 to repurchases under an accelerated share repurchase program. Cash used in financing activities also included debt repayments of $1.2billion,
 which was comprised of $750 million related to our 6.000% senior fixed rate notes due 2056 that were redeemed and $405 million related toour
 2.600% senior fixed rate notes due 2022 that were repurchased pursuant to a tender offer, and $466 million of cash dividends paid, partiallyoffset by proceeds from debt issuances of $2.5 billion.
Cash used
 in financing activities of $5.7 billion in 2020 was primarily used to repurchase $5.1 billion of common stock, repay outstanding debtof $1.8 billion and pay $447 mil
lion of cash dividends, partially offset by proceeds from debt issuances of $1.8 billion.The
 positive effect of exchange rate movements on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollaragainst other currencies, primarily the euro, during 2021 an

Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resource Requirements
As
 of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term
 non-equity investments from continuing operations, in an aggregate amount of $7.3 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. We believe that ourcash,
 cash  equivalents  and  short-term  and  long-term  investments,  together  with  cash  expected  to  be  generated  from  operations,  borrowingsavailable
 under our credit agreement and commercial paper program, and our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our materialcash requirements over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.
However, COVID-19 and related measures to contain its impact have caus
ed material disruptions in both national and global financial marketsand
 economies.  The  future  impact  of  COVID-19  and  these  containment  measures  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty  and  may  increase  ourborrowing costs and other costs
 of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and wecannot
 assure that we will have access to external financing at times and on terms we consider acceptable, or at all, or that we will not experienceother liquidity issues going forward.
Senior Notes
As
 of December 31, 2021, we had floating- and fixed-rate senior notes outstanding with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amountof $9.1 billion, with $1.4 billio
n payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the senior notes total $2.5 billion, with $0.2 billionpayable
 within 12 months. The net proceeds from the issuances of these senior notes are used for general corporate purposes, including, amongother things, capital expenditures, share repurchases, repayme
nt of indebtedness and possible acquisitions.In
 February  2022,  we  redeemed  the  $750  million  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  3.800%  senior  notes  due  March  2022.  Total  cashconsideration
 paid was $750 million as the redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount. In addition, we paid accrued and unpaidinterest on the principal amount.
Commercial Paper
We
 have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturityof
 up to $1.5 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. As of December 31, 2021, there were nocommercial paper notes outstanding.
Credit Agreement
In
 March 2020, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2 billion five-year credit facility. We may also, subject tothe
 agreement of the applicable lenders, increase commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $1 billion. Funds borrowed under thecredit
 agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. As of December 31,2021, no borrowings were outstandin
g under our $2 billion credit agreement. Credit Ratings
As
 of December 31, 2021, we were rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC (long-term rated BBB+, short-term
 rated A-2, with a stable outlook) and Moody’s Investor Service (long-term rated Baa1, short-term rated P-2, with a stable outlook). We disclosethese
 ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. Our borrowing costsdepend,
 in  part,  on  our  credit  ratings  and  any  actions  taken  by  these  credit  rating  agencies  to  lower  our  credit  ratings  will  likely  increase  ourborrowing costs. 
We
 were  in  compliance  with  all  financial  covenants  in  our  outstanding  debt  instruments  for  the  period  ended  December  31,  2021.  Foradditional details related to our de

Table of ContentsLeases
We
 have operating leases for office space, data centers, as well as other corporate assets that we utilize under lease arrangements. As ofDecember

Purchase
 obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, softwareapplications,
 engineering  development  services,  construction  contracts)  and  other  goods  and  services  entered  into  in  the  ordinary  course  ofbusiness. As of December 31, 2021, we had purchase o
bligations of $151 million, with $125 million payable within 12 months.Income Taxes
We
 are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $318 million included in otherliabil
ities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. The timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, and itis
 reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. However, given thenumber
 of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possibleadjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax be
nefits.As
 of December 31, 2021, our assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term non-equity investments fromcontinui
ng operations included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $5.0 billion. As we repatriate these funds to theU.S.,
 we will be required to pay income taxes in certain U.S. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the periodwhen such repatriation occurs. We have accrued deferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the U.S.
See
 “Note  15 — Income  Taxes”  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included in this  report  for  more  information  on unrecognized  taxbenefits and deferred taxes.
Stock Repurchases
Our
 stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and,subject to market
 conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstandingshare count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs wil
l be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.We
 expect,  subject  to  market  conditions  and  other  uncertainties,  to  continue  making  opportunistic  and  programmatic  repurchases  of  ourcommon
 stock.  However,  our  stock  repurchase  programs  may  be  limited  or  terminated  at  any  time  without  prior  notice.  The  timing  and  actualnumber
 of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, the impacts of the COVID-19pandemic, price and other market conditions and mana
gement’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash. During 2021, we repurchased approx
imately $7.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, including the acceleratedrepurchase
 agreement we entered into during the fourth quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, a total of approximately $2.0 billion remainedavailable
 for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. In February 2022 our Board authorized an additional$4.0
 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization. See “Note 13 — Stockholders’ Equity” to the consolidatedfinancial statements included in this report for more information about our stock repurchas

Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates
General
The
 preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions thataffect
 the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have basedour
 estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results ofwhich
 form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Oursenior management has discussed the deve
lopment, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
An accounting policy is considered to be
 critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that arehighly
 uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accountingestimates
 that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe the followingcritical
 accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.The
 following  descriptions  of  critical  accounting  policies,  judgments  and  estimates  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  consolidated  financialstatements and related notes and other disclosures incl
uded in this report.Revenue Recognition
We
 may  enter  into  certain  revenue  contracts  that  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  goods  or  services  including  discounts  on  futureservices.
 We also may enter into arrangements to purchase services from certain customers. As a result, significant interpretation and judgment issometimes
 required  to  determine  the  appropriate  accounting  for  these  transactions  including:  (1)  whether  services  are  considered  distinctperformance
 obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of eachdistinct
 performance obligation; (3) whether revenue should be reported gross (as eBay is acting as a principal), or net (as eBay is acting as anagent);
 (4) evaluating whether a promotion or incentive is a payment to a customer; and (5) whether the arrangement would be characterized asrevenue
 or reimbursement of costs incurred. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing oramount of revenue recognition.
Income Taxes
Our
 annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions inwhich
 we  operate.  Tax  laws  are  complex  and  subject  to  different  interpretations  by  the  taxpayer  and  respective  government  taxing  authorities.Significant
 judgment  is  required  in  determining  our  tax  expense  and  in  evaluating  our  tax  positions,  including  evaluating  uncertainties  and  thecomplexity
 of taxes on foreign earnings. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Taxpositions
 are evaluated for potential reserves for uncertainty based on the estimated probability of sustaining the position under examination. Ourincome
 tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings including U.S. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. The deferred taxbenefit
 derived from the amortization of our intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. Thedeferred
 tax benefit may from time to time change based on changes in tax rates. Management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest theundistributed earnings of our foreign subsi
diaries at the balance sheet date.Deferred
 tax  assets  represent  amounts  available  to  reduce  income  taxes  payable  on  taxable  income  in  future  years.  Such  assets  arisebecause
 of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and taxcredit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverabil
ity of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxableincome
 from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.These
 sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range andlong-range
 business forecasts. As of December 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance on certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwardsbased on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realize
d.46

Table of ContentsWe
 recognize  and  measure  uncertain  tax  positions  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  U.S.,  or  GAAP,pursuant to which we only recognize the tax
 benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained onexamination
 by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements fromsuch
 positions  are  then  measured  based  on  the  largest  benefit  that  has  a  greater  than  50  percent  likelihood  of  being  realized  upon  ultimatesettlement.
 We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.GAAP
 further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings inthe quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest an
d penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We
 file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain taxposition
 is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolutionof
 any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, aswell
 as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require theuse of cash.
The following table presents our effective tax rates for the periods indic
ated (in millions, except percentages): 
Year Ended December 31,  
2021  2020  2019 Income tax provision (benefit)
$ 146  $858  $219 Effective tax rate
36.6 %  25.6 %  13.2 % Our
 future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutoryrates
 and  higher  than  anticipated  in  countries  where  we  have  higher  statutory  rates,  by  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  orliabil
ities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examinationof
 our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as various state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood ofadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the ade
quacy of our provision for income taxes.Based
 on  our  results  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  a  one-percentage  point  change  in  our  provision  for  income  taxes  as  apercentage
 of  income  before  taxes  would  have  resulted  in  an  increase  or  decrease  in  the  provision  of  approximately  $4  million,  resulting  in  anapproximate $0.01 change in dil
uted earnings per share.Goodwill
The
 purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business withthe residual of the purchase price recorded as good
will.As
 of December 31, 2021, our goodwill totaled $4.2 billion. We assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting unit annually, or more oftenif
 events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unitlevel by first performing a
 qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than itscarrying
 value.  If  the  reporting  unit  does  not  pass  the  qualitative  assessment,  then  the  reporting  unit’s  carrying  value  is  compared  to  its  fairvalue. The fair
 values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches. Goodwill is considered impaired if thecarrying
 value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. The marketapproach
 uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting unit. Failure to achieve theseexpected
 results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test ofgoodwill
 as  of  August  31,  2021  and  2020.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  determined  that  no  impairment  of  the  carrying  value  of  goodwill  wasrequired. See “Note 4 — Goodwill and Intangi
ble Assets” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.47

Table of ContentsLegal Contingencies
In
 connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss, net of expected recoveries, andprovided
 for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income. These estimates have been based on our assessment of thefacts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are sub
ject to change based upon new information and future events.From
 time to time, we are involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are currently involvedin
 legal  proceedings,  some  of  which  are  discussed  in  “Item  1A:  Risk  Factors,”  “Item  3:  Legal  Proceedings”  and  “Note  12  —  Commitments  andContingencies”
 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims againstus,
 and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could requiresignificant
 amounts of management’s time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certainclaims,
 we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting asignificant
 part of our business. Any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financialposition, results of operations or cash flows.

Table of ContentsITEM 7A:
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate Risk
We
 are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investments and outstanding debt. In addition, adverse economic conditions and events(including
 volatility  or  distress  in  the  equity  and/or  debt  or  credit  markets)  may  impact  regional  and  global  financial  markets.  These  events  andconditions
 could cause us to write down our assets or investments. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from adverse economicconditions and events or changes in i
nterest rates.The
 primary  objective  of  our  investment  activities  is  to  preserve  principal  while  at  the  same  time  improving  yields  without  significantlyincreasing
 risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of asset types,including
 bank  deposits,  government  bonds  and  corporate  debt  securities.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  approximately  9%  of  our  total  cash  andinvestments
 was held in cash and cash equivalents. As such, changes in interest rates will impact interest income. As discussed below, the fairmarket
 values of our fixed rate securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if we areforced to sell securities that have declined in market value d
ue to changes in interest rates. 
As
 of  December  31,  2021,  the  balance  of  our  corporate  debt  and  government  bond  securities  was  $5.9  billion,  which  representedapproximately
 39%  of  our  total  cash  and investments.  Investments  in  both  fixed-rate  and floating-rate  interest-earning  instruments  carry  varyingdegrees
 of interest rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed-rate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates.In
 general, fixed-rate securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating ratesecurities
 generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected ifinterest
 rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, our investment incomemay
 fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interestrates.
 A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of $4 millionand $5 million as of December 31, 2021 an
d 2020, respectively.As
 of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate principal amount of $9.1 billion of outstanding senior notes, of which 96% bore interest atfixed rates. During 2020, we began to hedge the vari
ability of the cash flows in interest payments associated with our floating-rate debt using interestrate swaps. These interest rate swap agreements effectively convert our LIBOR-based floating-r
ate debt to a fixed-rate basis, reducing the impact ofinterest-rate
 changes on future interest expense. The total notional amount of these interest swaps was $400 million as of December 31, 2021 withterms
 calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate. Our interest rate swap contracts have maturity dates in2023.
 At December 31, 2021, we did not have an unhedged balance on our floating-rate debt. We considered the historical volatility of short-terminterest
 rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. Ahypotheti
cal 1% (100 basis points) decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our floating to fixed rate interestswaps of approximately $4 million at December 31, 20
21.Further
 changes  in  interest  rates  will  impact  interest  expense  on  any  borrowings  under  our  revolving  credit  facility,  which  bear  interest  atfloating
 rates,  and  the  interest  rate  on  any  commercial  paper  borrowings  we  make  and  any  debt  securities  we  may  issue  in  the  future  and,accordingly,
 will impact interest expense. For additional details related to our debt, see “Note 10 — Debt” to the consolidated financial statementsincluded in this report.
 
Equity Price Risk
Equity Investments
On
 June 24, 2021, we completed the transfer of our Classifieds business to Adevinta. Upon completion of the transfer we received an equityinterest
 in Adevinta. The equity investment is accounted for under the fair value option and changes in Adevinta’s stock price and equity volatilitymay
 have  a  significant  impact  on  the  value  of  our  equity  investment  in  Adevinta.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  a  one  dollar  change  in  Adevinta’scommon stock, holding other factors constant, would increase or decrease the fair valu
e of the investment by approximately $405 million.49

Table of ContentsIn
 August  2021  KakaoBank  completed  its  initial  public  offering,  which  resulted  in  this  investment  having  a  readily  determinable  fair  value.Previously
 this investment was accounted for as an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value. Valuation of equity investments withreadily
 determinable fair values can be obtained from real time quotes in active markets. Changes in KakaoBank’s stock price and equity volatilitymay
 have a significant impact on the value of our equity investment in KakaoBank. As of December 31, 2021, a one dollar change in KakaoBank’scommon stock, holding other factors constant, would increase or decrease the fair valu
e of the investment by approximately $14 million.As
 further described in the “Warrant” section below, we entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement withAdyen
 that,  subject  to  meeting  certain  conditions,  entitles  us  to  acquire  a  fixed  number  of  shares  up  to  5%  of  Adyen’s  fully  diluted  issued  andoutstanding
 share capital at a specific date. In 2021, we met the processing volume milestone target to vest the first tranche of the warrant. Uponvesting
 of the first tranche, we exercised the option to purchase shares of Adyen valued at $1.1 billion in exchange for approximately $110 million.Our
 equity investment in Adyen is accounted for as an equity investment with a readily determinable fair value. Changes in Adyen’s common stockprice
 and equity volatility may have a significant impact on the value of the investment. As of December 31, 2021, a one dollar change in Adyen’scommon stock, holding other factors constant, would increase or decrease the fair valu
e of the investment by approximately $0.4 million.Our
 remaining equity investments are primarily investments in privately-held companies. Our consolidated results of operations include, as acomponent
 of gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net, our share of the net income or loss of the equity investments accounted for underthe
 equity method of accounting, or the change in fair value of the equity method investments  accounted for under the fair value option. Equityinvestments
 without  readily  determinable  fair  values  are  accounted  for  at  cost,  less  impairment  and  adjusted  for  subsequent  observable  pricechanges obtain
ed from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments issued by the same investee. Such changes in the basis of the equityinvestment are
 recognized in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net. Equity investments under  the fair value option are measured at fairvalue
 based on a quarterly valuation analysis and are  classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation reflects management’sestimate
 of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the equity investment. S ubsequent changes in fair value are recognized ingain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net.
As
 of  December  31,  2021,  our  equity  investments  totaled  $8.0  billion,  which  represented  approximately  52%  of  our  total  cash  andinvestments, and primarily related to our equity investment in Adevinta.

 additional details related to our investments, please see “Note 6 — Investments” to our consolidated financial statements included in thisreport.
Warrant
We
 entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen that, subject to meeting certain conditions,entitles
 us  to  acquire  a  fixed  number  of  shares  up  to  5%  of  Adyen’s  fully  diluted  issued  and  outstanding  share  capital  at  a  specific  date.  Asdiscussed
 above, in 2021 we met the processing volume milestone target to vest the first tranche of the warrant, and we exercised the option topurchase
 shares of Adyen valued at $1.1 billion in exchange for approximately $110 million. The remaining tranches of the warrant are accountedfor
 as a derivative instrument under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives  and Hedging.  Changes in Adyen’s common stock price and equity volatility mayhave a significant impact on the
 value of the warrant. As of December 31, 2021, a one dollar change in Adyen’s common stock, holding other factorsconstant, would increase or decrease the fair
 value of the warrant by $0.2 million. For additional details related to the warrant, please see “Note 7 —Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements incl
uded in this report.Foreign Currency Risk
Our
 commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily theBritish
 pound and euro, subjecting us to foreign currency risk, which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact business in variousforeign
 currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use ofintellectual
 property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide. Our cash flow, results of operations that are exposed to foreignexchange rate
 fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuationsand related hedging activities.

Table of ContentsWe
 have  a  foreign  exchange  exposure  management  program  designed  to  identify  material  foreign  currency  exposures,  manage  theseexposures
 and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through thepurchase
 of foreign currency exchange contracts. The effectiveness of the program and resulting usage of foreign exchange derivative contracts isat
 times limited by our ability to achieve cash flow hedge accounting. For additional details related to our derivative instruments, please see “Note 7— Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements inclu

 use foreign exchange derivative contracts to help protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreigncurrency
 exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements.Most
 of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the derivative’s gain or lossis
 initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the sameperiod
 the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, the derivative’s gainor loss is recognized immediately in earning
s in our consolidated statement of income. However, only certain revenue and costs are eligible for cashflow hedge accounting.
The
 following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and the before-taxeffect on fair
 values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed as of December 31, 2021. The sensitivity for foreigncurrency contracts is based on a 20% adverse change in foreig
n exchange rates, against relevant functional currencies. 
Fair ValueAsset/(Liability)
Fair Value Sensitivity (In millions)
Foreign exchange co
ntracts - Cash flow hedges$ 87 $ (113) Since
 our risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value described above would be largely offset by changes inthe value of the underlying exposure.
We
 also use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other thanthe
 functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movementson
 our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in interest and other, net, which areoffset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchang
e contracts.We
 considered  the  historical  trends  in  currency  exchange  rates  and  determined  that  it  was  reasonably  possible  that  adverse  changes  inexchange
 rates  of  20%  for  all  currencies  could  be  experienced  in  the  near  term.  These  changes  would  have  resulted  in  an  adverse  impact  onincome before income taxes of
 approximately $13 million as of December 31, 2021 taking into consideration the offsetting effect of foreign exchangeforwards in place as of December 31, 2021.

Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public 
Accounting FirmTo the
 Board of Directors and Stockholders of eBay Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Cont
rol over Financial ReportingWe
 have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of eBay Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and therelated
 consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period endedDecember 31,
 2021, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2021 appearing
 under Item 15a.2. (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control overfinancial
 reporting  as  of  December  31,  2021,  based  on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  ofSponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In
 our  opinion,  the  consolidated financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  the  Company  as  ofDecember
 31, 2021 and 2020, and  the  results  of  its operations and its cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2021 inconformity
 with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,effective internal control o
ver financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Int egrated Framework (2013) issuedby the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's
 management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and forits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s annual report on
 internal control over financial reportingappearing
 under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal controlover
 financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)(PCAOB)
 and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules andregulations of the S
ecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance
 about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internalcontrol over financial repor
ting was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financialstatements,
 whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,evidence
 regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles usedand
 significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internalcontrol
 over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weaknessexists,
 and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performingsuch other procedures as we cons
idered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal 
Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal cont
rol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  overfinancial reporting includes
 those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparationof
 financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with
 authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, use, o
r disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.55

Table of ContentsCritical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter
 communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated orrequired to
 be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and(ii)
 involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe consolidated
 financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on thecritical audit matter or on
 the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Income Taxes – Unrecognized Tax Benef
its and Taxes on Foreign EarningsAs
 described in Notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and inevaluating
 management’s tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. As disclosed by management, theCompany’s
 income tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to their foreign earnings including U.S. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. The deferred taxbenefit
 derived from the amortization of the Company’s intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. Thedeferred
 tax benefit may from time to time change based on changes in tax rates. Management recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordancewith
 generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  U.S.,  or  GAAP,  pursuant  to  which  management  only  recognizes  the  tax  benefit  from  an  uncertain  taxposition
 if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.Tax
 positions are evaluated for potential reserves for uncertainty  based on the estimated  probability of sustaining the position under examination.  The totalincome
 tax  provision  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  was $146  million and  gross  amounts  of  unrecognized  tax  benefits  were $461  million  as  ofDecember 31, 2021
. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to income taxes - unrecognized tax benefits
 and taxes on foreign earningsis
 a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when evaluating tax positions relating to unrecognized tax benefits and taxes on foreignearnings,
 which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort, and subjectivity in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating tounrecognized tax benefits and taxes on fore
ign earnings. The audit effort also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter
 involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.
 These  procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to  income  taxes,  including  controls  over  unrecognized  tax  benefits  andtaxes
 on  foreign  earnings.  These  procedures  also  included,  among  others,  evaluating  tax  positions  taken  by  management,  including  evaluating  thereasonableness
 of management’s determination of the probability of sustaining the position under tax examination and identification of changes to tax positions,evaluating
 communications with the relevant tax authorities, testing applicable tax rates applied by management, and evaluating the impact of taxes on foreignearnings,
 including  the  calculation  of  U.S. minimum  taxes  on  foreign  earnings  and  the  deferred  tax  benefit  derived  from  the  amortization  of  the  Company’sintellectual property. Prof
essionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in testing the calculation of taxes on foreign earnings./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers

Note 1 — The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
eBay Inc. is a
 global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace platforms. Founded in 1995 in San Jose, California, eBay is one of theworld’s
 largest  and  most  vibrant  marketplaces  for  discovering  great  value  and  unique  selection.  Collectively,  we  connect  millions  of  buyers  andsellers around the
 world, empowering people and creating opportunity for all. Our technologies and services are designed to give buyers choice anda breadth of relevant inventory and to enable sel
lers worldwide to organize and offer their inventory for sale, virtually anytime and anywhere. When
 we refer to “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company” or “eBay” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean the current Delaware corporation(eBay Inc.) and its consolidated subsidiaries, un
less otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.On
 November 14, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of 80.01% of the outstanding equity interests of eBay Korea LLC, alimited liability
 company incorporated under the laws of Korea and a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay KTA (“eBay Korea”) to E-mart Inc. and one ofits
 wholly  owned  subsidiaries  (together,  “Emart”),  pursuant  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  securities  purchase  agreement,  in  exchange  forapproximately
 $3.0 billion of gross cash proceeds as of the transaction close date, subject to certain adjustments specified for indebtedness, cash,working
 capital,  transaction  expenses  and  certain  taxes.  The  sale  resulted  in  a  pre-tax  gain  of  $3.2  billion  inclusive  of  a  $81  million  currencytranslation
 adjustment and a $44 million gain on the net investment hedge settled in the fourth quarter of 2021, as well as income tax expense of$369 million. Upon completio
n of the sale, we retained 19.99% of the outstanding equity interests of the new entity, Gmarket Global LLC (“Gmarket”)formerly known
 as Apollo Korea, which is accounted for under the fair value option. Our equity investment in Gmarket was valued at $728 million asof the transaction close date.
We
 have classified the related assets and liabilities associated with our eBay Korea business as discontinued operations in our consolidatedbalance sheet. The results of
 our eBay Korea business have been presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of income forall
 periods  presented  through  November  14,  2021  as  the  transfer  represented  a  strategic  shift  in  our  business  that  had  a  major  effect  on  ouroperations and financial results. See “Note 3 — Disc
ontinued Operations” for additional information.On June 24, 2021, we completed the previously an
nounced transfer of our Classifieds business to Adevinta ASA (“Adevinta”) for $2.5 billion incash,
 subject to certain adjustments,  and approximately 540 million shares in Adevinta which represent an equity interest of 44%, comprised ofapproximately
 33% of voting shares and 11% of non-voting shares. Together, the total consideration received under the definitive agreement wasvalued
 at approximately $13.3 billion, based on the closing trading price of Adevinta’s outstanding shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange on June 24,2021.
 The equity interest received is accounted for under the fair value option. Our equity investment in Adevinta was valued at $10.8 billion as ofthe transaction close date.
On November 18, 2021, we
 completed the previously announced sale of approximately 135 million of our voting shares in Adevinta to AstinluxFinco
 S.à  r.l.  (“Permira”),  inclusive  of  the  option  exercised  by  Permira  to  purchase  additional  voting  shares,  for  total  cash  consideration  ofapproximately
 $2.3  billion.  At  the  close  of  the  sale  inclusive  of  the  option  exercised,  our  ownership  in  Adevinta  was  reduced  to  33%.  The  saleresulted
 in a pre-tax gain of $9 million which included an $88 million gain recognized on the sale of the shares offset by a $79 million loss from thechange
 in fair value of the shares sold through the date of sale, and resulted in no additional income tax. Following the sale in November 2021, ourequity
 investment in Adevinta is presented in the long-term assets section on the consolidated balance sheet to reflect our contractual requirementto retain at least 25% of the total number of issued and outstanding equ
ity securities of Adevinta until October 14, 2023.We
 have classified the related assets and liabilities associated with our Classifieds business as discontinued operations in our consolidatedbalance
 sheet. The results of our Classifieds business have been presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of income forall periods presented through June 2
4, 2021 as63

the transfer
 represented a strategic shift in our business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. See “Note 3 — DiscontinuedOperations” for additional information.
On November 24, 2019, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with an affiliate of viagogo to sell our StubHub business. The sale of our
StubHub
 business was completed on February 13, 2020. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, StubHub’s financial results for periods prior to thesale
 have  been  reflected  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  income  as  discontinued  operations.  Additionally,  the  related  assets  and  liabilitiesassociated
 with the discontinued operations in the prior periods are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheet. See“Note 3 — Discontinued Operations” for additional i
nformation.Use of Estimates
The
 preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (“GAAP”)  requiresmanagement
 to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets andliabilities at the date of the consolidate
d financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On anongoing
 basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction losses, legal contingencies, income taxes, revenuerecognition,
 stock-based  compensation,  investments,  goodwill  and  the  recoverability  of  intangible  assets.  We  base  our  estimates  on  historicalexperience
 and  on  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  thoseestimates.
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The
 accompanying financial statements are consolidated and include the financial statements of eBay Inc., our wholly and majority-ownedsubsidiaries
 and  variable  interest  entities  (“VIE”)  where  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  All  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  beeneliminated
 in consolidation. Minority interests are recorded as a noncontrolling interest. A qualitative approach is applied to assess the consolidationrequirement
 for VIEs. Generally, investments in entities where we hold at least a 20% ownership interest and have the ability to exercise significantinfluence,
 but not control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, including those in which the fair value optionhas
 been elected. For equity method investments, our share of the investees’ results of operations is included in gain (loss) on equity investmentsand
 warrant, net and this investment balance is included in long-term investments. For equity investments under the fair value option, the change infair
 value of the investment is included in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net and this investment balance is included in long-terminvestments.
 Investments in entities where we hold less than a 20% ownership interest are generally accounted for as equity investments to bemeasured
 at fair value or, under an election, at cost if it does not have readily determinable fair value, in which case the carrying value would beadjusted upon the occurrence of an observab
le price change in an orderly transaction for identical or similar instruments or impairment.Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue recognition
We
 recognize revenue when we transfer control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration towhich
 we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected, which are subsequentlyremitted to governmental authorities.
Net transaction revenues
Our
 net transaction revenues primarily include final value fees, feature fees, including fees to promote listings, and listing fees from sellers inour
 Marketplace. Our net transaction revenues also include store subscription and other fees often from large enterprise sellers. Our net transactionrevenues are reduced by incentives provid
ed to our customers.64

Table of ContentseBay Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We
 identified one performance obligation to sellers on our Marketplace platform, which is to connect buyers and sellers on our secure andtrusted
 Marketplace  platforms,  including  payment  processing  activities.  Final  value  fees  are  recognized  when  an  item  is  sold  on  a  Marketplaceplatform,
 satisfying  this  performance  obligation.  There  may  be  additional  services  available  to  Marketplace  sellers,  mainly  to  promote  or  featurelistings,
 that  are  not  distinct  within  the  context  of  the  contract.  Accordingly,  fees  for  these  additional  services  are  recognized  when  the  singleperformance
 obligation is satisfied. Promoted listing fees are recognized when the item is sold and feature and listing fees are recognized when anitem is sold, or when the contract expires.
Store
 subscription  and  other  nonstandard  listing  contracts  may  contain  multiple  performance  obligations,  including  discounts  on  futureservices.
 Determining  whether  performance  obligations  should  be  accounted  for  separately  or  combined  may  require  significant  judgment.  Thetransaction
 price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). In instances where SSP is not directlyobservable,
 we generally estimate selling prices based on when they are sold to customers of a similar nature and geography. These estimates aregenerally
 based on pricing strategies, market factors, strategic objectives and observable inputs. Store subscription revenues are recognized overthe
 subscription  period,  and  discounts  offered  through  store  subscription  or  nonstandard  listing  contracts  are  recognized  when  the  options  areexercised or when the options expire.
Further, to
 drive traffic to our platforms, we provide incentives to buyers and sellers in various forms including discounts on fees, discounts onitems
 sold,  coupons  and  rewards.  Evaluating  whether  a  promotion  or  incentive  is  a  payment  to  a  customer  may  require  significant  judgment.Promotions
 and incentives which are consideration payable to a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the later of when revenue isrecognized
 or when we pay or promise to pay the incentive. Promotions and incentives to most buyers on our Marketplace platforms, to whom wehave
 no performance obligation, are recognized as sales and marketing expense. In addition, we may provide credits to customers when we refundcertain
 fees.  Credits are accounted for as variable consideration  at contract  inception when estimating  the amount of revenue to be recognizedwhen
 a  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  of  revenue  will  not  occur  and  updated  asadditional information
 becomes available.Marketing services and other revenues
Our
 marketing  services  and  other  revenues  are  derived  principally  from  the  sale  of  advertisements  and  revenue  sharing  arrangements.Advertisi
ng revenue is derived principally from the sale of online advertisements which are based on “impressions” (i.e., the number of times that anadvertisement
 appears in pages viewed by users of our platforms) or “clicks” (which are generated each time users on our platforms click throughour
 advertisements to an advertiser’s designated website) delivered to advertisers. We use the output method and apply the practical expedient torecognize
 advertising revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice. For contracts with target advertising commitments with rebates,estimated payout is accounted for as a variable consid
eration to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.Revenues related to
 revenue sharing arrangements are recognized based on whether we are the principal and are responsible for fulfilling thepromise
 to  provide the specified  services  or whether  we are  an agent arranging  for  those services  to  be provided by our  partners.  Determiningwhether
 we are a principal or agent in these contracts may require significant judgment. If we are the principal, we recognize revenue in the grossamount of consideration received from the
 customer, whereas if we are an agent, we recognize revenue net of the consideration due to our partnersat
 a point in time when the services are provided. Our most significant revenue share arrangements are with shipping service providers. We areprimarily acting as an
 agent in these contracts and revenues are recognized at a point in time when we have satisfied our promise of connecting theshipping service provider to our customer.

Internal use software and platform development costs
Direct
 costs incurred to develop software for internal use and platform development costs are capitalized and amortized over an estimateduseful
 life of one  to five years. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we capitalized costs, primarily related to labor and stock-based
 compensation, of $127 million and $129 million, respectively. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $133 million, $139 millionand
 $150  million  for  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  Costs  related  to  the  design  or  maintenance  of  internal  use  software  and  platformdevelopment are expensed as incurred.
Advertising expense
We
 expense the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements inthe
 period during which the advertising space or airtime is used, in each case as sales and marketing expense. Internet advertising expenses arerecognized based on the terms of
 the individual agreements, which are generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of impressions deliveredover
 the  total  number  of  contracted  impressions,  on  a  pay-per-click  basis,  or  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  contract.  Advertisingexpense totaled $1.1 billio
n, $1.1 billion and $0.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Stock-based compensation
We
 have equity incentive plans under which we grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), total shareholderreturn
 performance stock units (“TSR PSUs”), performance-based restricted stock units, and performance share units, to our directors, officers andemployee
s. We primarily issue RSUs. We determine compensation expense associated with RSUs based on the fair value of our common stock onthe date of grant. We determine compensation expense associate
d with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value method using theBlack-Scholes valuation mode
l. We generally recognize compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method over the respective vestingperiod
 for awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense for 2021, 2020 and 2019 has been reducedfor
 estimated forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behaviors as well as trends of actual option forfeitures. Werecognize
 a  benefit  or  provision  from  stock-based  compensation  in  earnings  as  a  component  of  income  tax  expense  to  the  extent  that  anincremental tax benefit or deficiency is realized by foll
owing the ordering provisions of the tax law.Provision for transaction losses
Provision
 for  transaction  losses  consists  primarily  of  losses  resulting  from  our  buyer  protection  programs,  payment  misuse  includingchargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant relate
d chargebacks due to non-delivery of goods or services and account takeovers.Provision
 for transaction losses represent our estimate of actual losses based on our historical experience and many other factors includingchanges to our protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes as well as ec
onomic conditions such as COVID-19.Provision for credit losses
Provision
 for  credit  losses  consist  of  bad  debt  expense  associated  with  our  accounts  receivable  balance.  These  losses  are  recorded  inprovision for transaction losses in our consolid
ated statement of income.We are exposed to credit losses primarily through our receivables from sellers or advertisers. We develop estimates to reflect the risk
 of creditloss
 which are based on historical loss trends adjusted for asset specific attributes, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts ofthe
 economic conditions that will exist through the contractual life of the financial asset. Our receivables are recovered over a period of 0-180 days,therefore,
 forecasted changes to economic conditions are not expected to have a significant effect on the estimate of the allowance for doubtfulaccounts,
 except in extraordinary circumstances. We write off the asset when it is no longer deemed collectible or when it goes past due 180 dayswhichever is earlier, with certain limited exceptio
ns.66

Table of ContentseBay Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We
 monitor our ongoing credit exposure through an active review of collection trends. Our activities include monitoring the timeliness of paymentcollection,
 managing dispute resolution and performing timely account reconciliations. We may employ collection agencies to pursue recovery ofdefaulted receivables.
Customer accounts and funds receivable
These
 balances represent payments  in transit and cash received and held  by financial institutions and payment processors associated withmarketplace activity and awaiting settlement or are installment col
lections from financial institutions.We
 are exposed to credit losses from customer accounts and funds receivable balances held by third party financial institutions. We assessthese
 balances for credit loss based on a review of the average period for which the funds are held, credit ratings of the financial institutions and byassessing the probability of default and l
oss given default models. At December 31, 2021 and 2020 , we did not record any credit-related loss. Payment processor advances
Payment processor advan
ces represent amounts prefunded to and held by payment processors in order to fund outflows in the normal courseof the transaction lifecycle, including but not limited to payme
nt processor fees, seller account payouts, and incentives such as coupons or gift cards.Payment
 processor advances are recorded within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Other accounts are used to collect andremit
 indirect taxes from the buyer to the local tax authorities and to transfer shipping label proceeds from the seller to the relevant shipping serviceproviders.
 Generally,  changes  in  balances  that  impact  the  determination  of  net  income,  such  as  payment  processor  fees  and  incentives  arepresented
 within operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Changes in balances that pertain solely to payment intermediationactivities (e.g. seller pay-out services) are presented within financi
ng activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.Customer accounts and funds payable
These
 balances primarily represent the Company’s liability towards its customers to settle the funds from the completed transactions on theplatform associated with marketplace activity.
Income taxes
Significant
 judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and thecomplexity
 of taxes on foreign earnings. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Taxpositions
 are evaluated for potential reserves for uncertainty based on the estimated probability of sustaining the position under examination. Ourincome
 tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings including U.S. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. The deferred taxbenefit
 derived from the amortization of our intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. Thedeferred tax benefit may from time to time change based on changes in tax rates. 
We
 account  for  income  taxes  using an  asset  and liability  approach,  which  requires  the  recognition  of  taxes  payable  or  refundable  for  thecurrent
 year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statementsor
 tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of futurechanges in
 tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefitsthat are not expected to be realized based on avai
lable evidence.We
 report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Werecognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unreco
gnized tax benefits in income tax expense.67

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash
Cash
 and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased, whichmay include bank deposits, U.S. Treasury securities, time deposits, and certificates of dep
osit.We
 consider cash to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. Our restricted cash balance is primarily comprised ofcash on deposit with banks restricted to safeguard seller pay
ables.Investments
Short-term investments are
 primarily comprised of corporate debt securities, commercial paper and government and agency securities. Short-term investments are investments with original maturities of less than one year when purch
ased, are classified as available-for-sale and are reportedat
 fair value using the specific identification method. Short-term investments also include equity securities with readily determinable fair values thatcan be sold in active markets.
Long-term
 investments are primarily comprised of corporate debt securities, government and agency securities, equity investment under thefair
 value option, equity investments under the equity method of accounting and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. Debtsecurities are classified as availabl
e-for-sale and are reported at fair value using the specific identification method.Unrealized
 gains  and  losses  on  our  available-for-sale  debt  securities  are  excluded  from  earnings  and  reported  as  a  component  of  othercomprehensive income (loss), net of related estimated income tax provisions or be
nefits. We periodically assess our portfolio of debt investments for impairment.
 For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, this assessment first takes into account our intent to sell, or whether it is more likelythan
 not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria are met, the debt security’samortized
 cost basis is written down to fair value through interest and other, net. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position that do not meetthe
 aforementioned criteria, we assess whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment,we
 consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverseconditions specifically related to the security, among
 other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss may exist, the present value of cashflows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected
to
 be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recorded through interest andother,
 net,  limited  by  the  amount  that  the  fair  value  is  less  than  the  amortized  cost  basis.  Any  additional  impairment  not  recorded  through  anallowance
 for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for(or
 reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of an available-for-sale
 security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. These changes are recorded in gain (loss) onequity investments and warrant, net.
Our
 equity investments include equity investments with readily determinable fair values, equity investments without readily determinable fairvalues
 and equity investments under the equity method of accounting, including those in which the fair value option has been elected. Our equityinvestment in Adevinta is described in a sep
arate section under “Equity investment in Adevinta” in this Note.Equity investments
 with readily determinable fair values are investments in publicly-traded companies for which we do not exercise significantinfluence
 and are measured at fair value based on the respective closing stock price and prevailing foreign exchange rate, as applicable, at theperiod end
 date. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation canbe
 obtained from real time quotes in active markets. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in gain  (loss) on equity investments andwarrant
, net. Equity
 investments without  readily  determinable  fair  values are  non-marketable  equity  securities,  which  are  investments  in  privately-heldcompanies
 for which we do not exercise significant influence and are accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurementalternative, the carrying value is measured at cost

 impairment,  if  any,  plus  or  minus  changes  resulting  from  observable  price  changes  in  orderly  transactions  for  the  identical  or  a  similarinvestment
 of the same issuer. We  perform  a qualitative fair value assessment  on a quarterly  basis over our equity investments  without readilydeterminable
 fair values to identify any changes in basis or impairments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are consideredimpaired
 when there is an indication that the fair value of our interest is less than the carrying amount. Changes in value and impairments of equityinvestments without readily determinable fair valu
es are recognized in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant , net. We
 account for equity investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equitymethod
 or under the fair value option. For equity method investments, our consolidated results of operations include, as a component of gain (loss) on
 equity investments and warrant,  net, our share of the net income or loss of the equity investments accounted for under the equity method ofaccounting.
 Our  share  of  equity  method  investees’  results  of  operations  was  not  material  for  any  period  presented.  We  perform  a  qualitativeimpairment assessm
ent on a quarterly basis over our equity method investments. Equity method investments are considered impaired when there isan
 indication  of  an  other-than-temporary  decline  in  value  below  the  carrying  amount.  Impairments  and any  other adjustments to equity  methodinvestments are recorded in gain (loss) on equity investments and w
arrant, net.Equity
 investment under the fair value option is measured at fair value based on a quarterly valuation analysis and is  classified within Level 3in
 the fair value hierarchy as the valuation reflects management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the equityinvestment. 
S ubsequent changes in fair value are recognized in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant , net. We describe our accounting policy for our equity investment in A
devinta in a separate section under “Equity investment in Adevinta.”Refer to “Note 6 — Investments” and “Note 8 — Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities” for addition
al details.Equity investment in Adevinta
At
 the initial recognition of our equity investment in Adevinta on June 24, 2021, we elected the fair value option where subsequent changes infair value
 are recognized in gain (loss) on  equity investments and warrant,  net in the consolidated statement of income. We report the investment atfair
 value  within  equity  investment  in  Adevinta  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  The  investment  is  classified  within  Level  1  in  the  fair  valuehierarchy
 as the valuation can be obtained from real time quotes in active markets. The fair value of the equity investment is measured based onAdevinta’s
 closing  stock  price  and  prevailing  foreign  exchange  rate.  We  believe  the  fair  value  option  election  creates  more  transparency  of  thecurrent value of our shares in the equity investment for Adevinta.
Refer to “Note 6 — Investments” and “Note 8 — Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities” for addition
al details.Leases
We
 determine if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the presentvalue of
 the remaining lease payments, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. As the rate implicit in the leaseis
 not  readily  determinable  for  our  operating  leases,  we  generally  use  an  incremental  borrowing  rate  based  on  information  available  at  thecommencement
 date  to  determine  the  present  value  of  future  lease  payments.  Operating  right-of-use  (“ROU”)  assets  are  generally  recognizedbased
 on the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to eight years, some of whichinclude options
 to extend the leases for up to five years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within one year. Lease expenseis
 recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for ourdata center leases. Lease and non-leas
e components for all other leases are accounted for separately.Operating
 leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, other current liabilities and operating lease liabilities on our consolidatedbalance sheets.

Property and equipment
Property
 and  equipment  are  stated  at  historical  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation.  Depreciation  for  equipment,  buildings  and  leaseholdimprovements
 commences once they are ready for our intended use. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimateduseful
 lives  of  the  assets,  generally, one  to  three  years  for  computer  equipment  and  software,  up  to  thirty  years  for  buildings  and  buildingimprovement
s, the shorter of five years or the term of the lease for leasehold improvements and three years for furniture, fixtures and vehicles. Landis not depreciated.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill
 is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis at the reporting unit level. A qualitative assessment can be performed todetermine
 whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not passthe qualitative assessment, then the 
reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated usingincome
 and market approaches. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The discountedcash
 flow  method,  a  form  of  the  income  approach,  uses  expected  future  operating  results  and  a  market  participant  discount  rate.  The  marketapproach
 uses  comparable  company  prices  and  other  relevant  information  generated  by  market  transactions  (either  publicly  traded  entities  ormergers
 and acquisitions) to develop pricing metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results of our reporting unit. Failure toachieve
 these expected results, changes in the discount rate or market pricing metrics may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reportingunit.
 We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2021 and 2020 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying valueof goodwill for any reporting unit was required. 
Intangible
 assets consist of purchased customer lists and user base, marketing related, developed technologies and other intangible assets,including
 patents and contractual agreements. Intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line methodand estimated useful lives ranging from 
one  to three years. No significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets.Impairment of long-lived assets
We
 evaluate long-lived assets (including leases and intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicatethat
 the  carrying  amount  of  a  long-lived  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.  An  asset  is  considered  impaired  if  its  carrying  amount  exceeds  theundisco
unted future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. In 2021 and 2020, we recorded immaterial impairment charges and in 2019, noimpairment was recorded.
Foreign currency
Most
 of  our  foreign  subsidiaries  use  the  local  currency  of  their  respective  countries  as  their  functional  currency.  Assets  and  liabilities  aretranslated
 into  U.S.  dollars  using  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  balance  sheet  date,  while  revenues  and  expenses  are  translated  at  averageexchange
 rates during the year. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of our consolidated balance sheet are recorded as a component ofaccumulated other comprehensive income.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized as interest an

 exceptions to the general principles and also simplification of areas such as franchise taxes, step-up in tax basis goodwill, separate entityfinancial
 statements  and  interim  recognition  of  enactment  of  tax  laws  or  rate  changes.  The  standard  is  effective  for  annual  reporting  periodsbeginning
 after December 15, 2020, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of2021 with no material impact on our consolid
ated financial statements.In
 2020,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  decrease  diversity  in  practice  and  increase  comparability  for  the  accounting  of  certain  equitysecurities
 and investments under the equity method of accounting. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscalyears,
 beginning  after  December  15,  2020.  We  adopted  this  guidance  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021  with  no  material  impact  on  our  consolidatedfinancial statements.

Note 2 — Net Income Per Share
Basic
 net  income  per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  net  income  for  the  period  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  sharesoutstanding
 during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number ofshares
 of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and equityincentive
 awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income pershare excludes all anti-dilutive common sh

 consider cash to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. Restricted cash is held primarily in interest bearingaccounts
 for letters of credit primarily related to our global sabbatical program. In 2020, our restricted cash balance also included cash on depositwith
 banks  restricted  to  safeguard  seller  payables.  Our  fixed-income  investments  consist  of  predominantly  investment  grade  corporate  debtsecurities and government and agency securities.
 The corporate debt and government and agency securities that we invest in are generally deemedto be low risk based on their credit ratings from the major rating agencies.
The
 longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As interestrates
 increase,  those  securities  purchased  at  a  lower  yield  show  a  mark-to-market  unrealized  loss.  The  unrealized  losses  are  due  primarily  tochanges
 in credit spreads and interest rates. We regularly review investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment using both qualitativeand
 quantitative  criteria.  Investments  classified  as  available-for-sale  debt  securities  are  carried  at  fair  value  with  changes  reflected  in  othercomprehensive
 income. Where there is an intention or a requirement to sell an impaired available-for-sale debt security, the entire impairment isrecognized
 in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security. We presently do not intend to sell any of theavailable-for-sale debt securities in an u
nrealized loss position and expect to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity or sale.We
 regularly review investment securities for credit impairment using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In making this assessment, weconsider
 the  extent  to  which  fair  value  is  less  than  amortized  cost,  any  changes  to  the  rating  of  the  security  by  a  rating  agency,  any  adverseconditions
 specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cashflows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected
to
 be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recorded through interest andother, net for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is

At
 the initial recognition of the equity investment, we elected the fair value option where subsequent changes in fair value are recognized inearnings.

 The fair value of the equity investment is measured based on Adevinta’s closing stock price and prevailing foreign exchange rate at eachbalance sheet
 date and the changes in fair value are reflected in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net in the consolidated statement ofincome.
 We believe the fair value option election creates more transparency of the current value in the equity investment in Adevinta. Our non-voting shares are convertib

 an unrealized loss of $3,070 million and a realized gain on sale of $9 million were recorded in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant,net
 on  our  consolidated  statement  of  income  related  to  the  investment.  The  realized  gain  on  sale  of  $9  million  included  an  $88  million  gainrecognized on the sale of the shares offset by a $79 million l

In
 August 2021, one of our equity investments, KakaoBank Corp. (“KakaoBank”), which previously did not have a readily determinable fairvalue,
 completed  its  initial  public  offering  which  resulted  in  this  investment  having  a readily  determinable  fair  value.  The  fair  value  of  the  equityinvestment
 is measured based on KakaoBank’s closing stock price and prevailing foreign exchange rate at each balance sheet date. For the yearended
 December 31, 2021 an unrealized gain of $403 million was recorded in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net related to thechange
 in  fair  value  of  the  investment.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  a  gain  of  $83  million  was  recorded  in  gain  (loss)  on  equityinvestments and warrant, net related 
to the sale of a portion of the shares of the investment for $114 million. As of December 31, 2021, the fair valueof the investment was $684 million 
and is reported within short-term investments in our consolidated ba lance sheet. We
 entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen that vests in a series of four tranches, at aspecified
 price per share upon meeting processing volume milestone targets on a calendar year basis. When a relevant milestone is reached, thewarrant
 becomes exercisable with respect to the corresponding tranche of warrant shares up until the warrant expiration date of January 31, 2025.In the fourth quarter of 2021, we met the processing volume milestone target to vest the first tranche of the warrant. Upon vesting of the first tranche,
we
 exercised the option to purchase shares of Adyen valued at $1.1 billion in exchange for approximately $110 million in cash. The fair value of theequity
 investment  is  measured  based  on  Adyen’s  closing  stock  price  and  prevailing  foreign  exchange  rate  at  each  balance  sheet  date.  As  ofDecember
 31, 2021, the fair value of the investment was $1,061 million and  is reported within short-term investments in our consolidated balancesheet. Refer to “Note 7 —
 Derivative Instruments” for more information about the warrant.Equity investment under the fair value option
We
 account for equity investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the fairvalue option or under the equity method. Our equity investment in Gmarket is accounted for und
er the fair value option.On
 November 14, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of 80.01% of the outstanding equity interests of eBay Korea to Emart.Upon
 completion of the sale, we retained 19.99% of the outstanding equity interest of the new entity, Gmarket, over whom we are able to exercisesignificant
 influence based on the terms of the securities purchase agreement, including through our board representation. Our equity investment inGmarket
 was valued at $728 million as of the transaction close date. At the initial recognition of this equity investment, we elected the fair valueoption where subsequent changes in
 fair value are recognized in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net in the consolidated statement ofincome.
 We believe the fair value option election creates more transparency of the current value in the equity investment in Gmarket. Our retainedinvestment
 in  Gmarket  is  subject  to  a  two  year  right  held  by  Emart  to  purchase  the  remaining  interest  at  the  close  price  of  the  sale.  As  ofDecember
 31, 2021, the fair value of the investment was $725 million and is reported within long-term investments in our consolidated balancesheet.
The
 investment is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation reflects management’s estimate of assumptions that marketparticipants would use in pricing the e
quity investment. Refer to “Note 8 — Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities” for more information.Other equity method investments
We
 account for equity investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the fairvalue

Note 7 — Derivative Instruments
Our
 primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currencyexchange
 rates and interest rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign exchange rate andinterest rate movements. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes.
We
 use  foreign  currency  exchange  contracts  to  reduce  the  volatility  of  cash  flows  related  to  forecasted  revenues,  expenses,  assets  andliabilities,
 including intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are generally one month to one year in duration, butwith maturities up to
 24 months. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to ensure that ultimately the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows arenot
 adversely  affected  by  changes  in  the  applicable  U.S.  dollar/foreign  currency  exchange  rate.  We  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  our  foreignexchange contracts designated as cash flow or net inv
estment hedges on a quarterly basis.In
 2020, we began to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments on anticipated debt issuance using forward-starting interest rateswaps.
 These interest rate swaps effectively fix the benchmark interest rate and have the economic effect of hedging the variability of forecastedinterest
 payments for up to 10 years on an anticipated debt issuance. Similar to other cash flow hedges, we recorded changes in the fair value ofthese
 interest rate swaps in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) until the anticipated debt issuance. In May 2021, we issued$2.5 billion of senior unsecur
ed notes, which consisted of notes maturing in 2026, 2031 and 2051. As a result, we terminated the interest rate swapsand
 the gain associated with the termination of approximately $45 million is amortized to interest expense over the terms of our notes due in May2026 and May 2031.
During 2020,
 we began to hedge the variability of the cash flows in interest payments associated with our floating-rate debt using interest rateswaps.
 These interest rate swap agreements effectively convert our floating-rate debt that is based on London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) toa
 fixed-rate basis, reducing the impact of interest-rate changes on future interest expense. The total notional amount of these interest swaps was$400
 million as of December 31, 2021 with terms calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate. Our interestrate
 swap contracts have maturity dates in 2023. Similar to other cash flow hedges, we record changes in the fair value of these interest rate swapsin AOCI and their fair value will be amortized over the term of the debt to interest expense.
We
 used interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on our fixed rate notes issued in July 2014 and maturing in 2019, 2021 and 2024.These
 interest rate swaps had the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with $2.4 billion of these notes so that theinterest
 payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR plus a spread. These interest rate swaps were terminated in2019.
Cash Flow Hedges
For
 derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges, the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCIand
 subsequently  reclassified  into  earnings  in  the  same  period  the  forecasted  hedged  transaction  affects  earnings.  Derivative  instrumentsdesignated as cash flow hedges must be de-d
esignated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initiallyidentified
 time  period  or  within  a  subsequent  two-month  time  period.  Unrealized  gains  and  losses  in  AOCI  associated  with  such  derivativeinstruments are immediately reclassified into earnings
.  As of December 31, 2021, we have estimated that approximately $16 million of net derivativegains
 related  to  our  foreign  exchange  cash  flow  hedges  and  no  net  derivative  losses  related  to  our  interest  rate  cash  flow  hedges  included  inaccumulated
 other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. We classify cash flows related to our cashflow hedges as operating activities in o
ur consolidated statement of cash flows.86

Table of ContentseBay Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Fair Value Hedges
We
 designated the interest rate swaps used to manage interest rate risk on our fixed rate notes issued in July 2014 and maturing in 2019,2021
 and 2024 as qualifying hedging instruments and accounted for them as fair value hedges. These transactions were designated as fair valuehedges
 for financial accounting purposes because they protected us against changes in the fair value of certain of our fixed rate borrowings due tobenchmark
 interest  rate  movements.  In  2019,  $1.15  billion  related  to  our  2.200%  senior  notes  due  2019  of  the  $2.4  billion  aggregate  notionalamount
 matured. In addition, during 2019, we terminated the interest rate swaps related to $750 million of our 2.875% senior notes due July 2021and
 $500 million of our 3.450% senior notes due July 2024. As a result of the early termination, hedge accounting was discontinued prospectivelyand
 the  gain  on  termination  was  recorded  as  an  increase  to  the  long-term  debt  balance  and  is  being  recognized  over  the  remaining  life  of  theunderlyi
ng debt as a reduction to interest expense. The gain recognized was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31,2019
.Non-Designated Hedges
Our
 derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetaryassets or
 liabilities, including intercompany balances and equity investments denominated in non-functional currencies. The gains and losses on ourderivatives
 not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in interest and other,  net, which are offset by the foreign currency gains and losseson
 the related assets and liabilities that are also recorded in interest and other, net. We classify cash flows related to our non-designated hedginginstruments in the same line item as the cash flows of the related assets or liabilities, wh
ich is generally within operating activities in our consolidatedstatement
 of cash flows. Cash flows related to the settlement of non-designated hedging instruments related to equity investments are classifiedwithin investing activities in our conso
lidated statement of cash flows.Warrant
We
 entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen that, subject to meeting certain conditions,entitles us
 to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5% of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. The warranthas
 a  term  of  seven  years  and  vests  in  a  series  of  four  tranches,  at  a  specified  price  per  share  (fixed  for  the  first  two  tranches)  upon  meetingprocessing
 volume milestone targets on a calendar year basis. When or if a relevant milestone is reached, the warrant becomes exercisable withrespect
 to the corresponding tranche of warrant shares up until the warrant expiration date of January 31, 2025. The maximum number of tranchesthat can vest in one calendar year is two.
In 2021, we met the
 processing volume milestone target to vest the first tranche of the warrant. Upon vesting of the first tranche, we exercisedthe
 option  to  purchase  shares  of  Adyen  valued  at  approximately  $1.1  billion  in  exchange  for  approximately  $110  million  in  cash.  Our  equityinvestment
 in Adyen is accounted for as an equity investment  with a readily determinable  fair value. Refer  to “Note  6 — Investments” for moreinformation about our equity investments.
 
The warrant is accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 8
15, Derivatives and Hedging . We report the warrant at fair value within warrant asset
 in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  warrant  are  recognized  in  gain  (loss)  on  equity  investments  andwarrant,
 net in our consolidated statement  of income. The day-one value attributable to the other side of the warrant, which was recorded as adeferred
 credit, is reported within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and is amortized over the life of the commercial arrangement.See “Note 8 — Fair Value Measurements” for information about the fair value measurement of the warrant.

Credit Risk
Our derivatives
 expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek tomitigate
 such risk by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of losswith
 any one counterparty  resulting  from  this type of credit  risk  is monitored  on an ongoing basis.  To further  limit  credit  risk,  we also enter  intocollateral
 security arrangements related to certain interest rate derivative instruments whereby collateral is posted between counterparties if the fairvalue
 of the derivative instrument exceeds certain thresholds. Additional collateral would be required in the event of a significant credit downgradeby either party. We are not required to pledge, nor are we entitled to receive, collateral rel

 instrument,  is  valued  using  a  Black-Scholes  model.  Key  assumptions  used  in  the  valuation  include  risk-free  interest  rates;  Adyen’scommon
 stock price, equity volatility and common stock outstanding; exercise price; and details specific to the warrant. The value is also probabilityadjusted
 for  management’s  assumptions  with  respect  to  vesting  of  the  remaining  three  tranches  which  are  each  subject  to  meeting  processingvolume
 milestone targets. These assumptions and the probability of meeting processing volume milestone targets may have a significant impact onthe value of the warrant. Refer to “Note 7 — Derivative Instruments” for further details on our derivative instruments.

Contract Balances
Timing
 of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers.  Accounts receivable represents amounts invoiced andrevenue
 recognized  prior  to  invoicing  when  we  have  satisfied  our  performance  obligation  and  have  the  unconditional  right  to  payment.  Theallowance
 for doubtful accounts and authorized credits is estimated based upon our assessment of various factors including historical experience,the
 age of the accounts receivable balances, current economic conditions reasonable  and supportable forecasts and  other factors that may affectour customers’
 ability to pay. The allowance for doubtful accounts and authorized credits was $74 million and $136 million as of December 31, 2021and
 December 31, 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we reported allowances for doubtful accounts of $42 million reflecting a decreaseof $55 million, net of write-offs of $134 million for the year ended December 31, 20
21.Deferred revenue
 consists of fees received related to unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the period. Due to the generally short-term
 duration  of  contracts,  the  majority  of  the  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  in  the  following  reporting  period.  The  amount  of  revenuerecognized
 during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  that  was  included  in  the  deferred  revenue  balance  at  the  beginning  of  the  period  was$47

Senior Notes
Effective
 March 1, 2021, the company redeemed the $750 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.000% senior notes due 2056. Totalcash
 consideration paid was $750 million, as the redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount. In addition, we paid accrued andunpaid interest on 
the principal amount.In
 March 2021, we settled cash tender offers with holders of approximately 39% of the total outstanding $1 billion aggregate principal amountof
 the 2.600% senior fixed rate notes due 2022. Total cash consideration paid for these purchases was $405 million and the carrying amount of thenotes
 was $395 million, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of $10 million (including immaterial fees and other costs associated with the tender),which
 was recorded in interest and other, net in our consolidated statement of income. In addition, we paid any accrued interest on the tenderednotes up to, but not including the date of settlement.
In
 May 2021, we issued senior notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion, which consisted of $750 million of 1.400% fixed ratenotes due 2026, $750 million of 2.60
0% fixed rate notes due to 2031 and $1.0 billion of 3.650% fixed rate notes due 2051.(1)96

Table of ContentseBay Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
In
 March 2020, we issued $500 million of 1.900% fixed rate notes due 2025 and $500 million of 2.700% fixed rate notes due 2030. In June2020, we issued $300 millio
n of additional 1.900% fixed rate notes due 2025 and $450 million of additional 2.700% fixed rate notes due 2030.We
 used a portion of these proceeds to complete a tender offer to purchase any and all of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our2.875%
 senior  fixed  rate  notes  due  in  2021  for  aggregate  cash  consideration  paid  of  $771  million.  The  loss  on  extinguishment  of  $10  million(including
 an immaterial amount of fees and other costs associated with the tender) and the premium of $11 million were recorded in interest andother, net in our consolidated statement of income. In addition, we pai
d accrued interest up to the settlement date.In June 2020, $500 million of our 2.150% sen
ior fixed rate notes matured and were repaid.In
 July 2020, we exercised our option to redeem in whole the 3.250% senior fixed rate notes due in 2020 at a price equal to 100% of theprincipal amount of $500 million, pl
us accrued interest.In 2019, $400 million of floating rate notes and $
1.15 billion of 2.200% fixed rate notes matured and were repaid.None
 of the floating rate notes are redeemable prior to maturity. We may redeem some or all of the other fixed rate notes of each series atany time and from time to time prior to their maturity, generally at a make-whole redemption price, plus accrued and unpa
id interest.If
 a change of control triggering event (as defined in the applicable senior notes) occurs with respect to the 3.800% fixed rate notes due 2022,the
 floating rate notes due 2023, the 2.750% fixed rate notes due 2023, the 1.900% fixed rate notes due 2025, the 1.400% fixed rate notes due2026,
 the 3.600% fixed rate notes due 2027, the 2.700% fixed rate notes due 2030, the 2.600% fixed rate notes due 2031 or the 3.650% fixed ratenotes
 due 2051, we must, subject to certain exceptions, offer to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a price equal to 101% of theprincipal amount, plus accrued and un
paid interest.The
 indenture  pursuant  to  which  the  senior  notes  were  issued  includes  customary  covenants  that,  among  other  things  and  subject  toexceptions,
 limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactionswith
 respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of default with customary grace periods in certain circumstances, includingpayment defaults and bankruptcy-related defaults.
To
 help  achieve  our  interest  rate  risk  management  objectives,  during  the  second  quarter  of  2020,  we  entered  into  interest  rate  swapagreements
 that effectively converted $400 million of our LIBOR-based floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis. These swaps were designated ascash flow hedges and have maturity dates in 202
3.The
 effective interest rates for our senior notes include the interest payable, the amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization ofany
 original issue discount and premium on these senior notes. Interest on these senior notes is payable either quarterly or semiannually. Interestexpense
 associated with these senior notes, including amortization of debt issuance costs, during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and2019
 was approximately $257 million, $284 million and $301 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the estimated fair value ofthese senior notes, using Level 2 inputs, was ap
proximately $9.5 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively.Commercial Paper
We
 have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturityof
 up to $1.5 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there wereno commercial paper notes outstanding.
Credit Agreement
In
 March 2020, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2 billion five-year credit facility. We may also, subject tothe agreement of the applicable lend
ers, increase commitments under the revolving97

credit
 facility by up to $1 billion. Funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions andother
 general corporate purposes. The credit agreement replaced our prior $2 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement dated November 2015,which was terminated effective March 2020.
As
 of December 31, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement. However, as described above, we have anup
 to $1.5 billion commercial paper program and are required to maintain available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in order to repaycommercial
 paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due, in an aggregateamount
 of $1.5 billion. As of December 31, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under our commercial paper program; therefore, $2 billion ofborrowing
 capacity was available for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. The creditagreement
 includes  a  covenant  limiting  our  consolidated  leverage  ratio  to  no  more  than  4.0:1.0,  subject  to,  upon  the  occurrence  of  a  qualifiedmaterial
 acquisition, if so elected by us, a step-up to 4.5:1.0 for the four fiscal quarters completed following such qualified material acquisition. Thecredit
 agreement  includes  customary  events  of  default,  with  corresponding  grace  periods  in  certain  circumstances,  including  payment  defaults,cross-defaults
 and bankruptcy-related defaults. In addition, the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, includingrestrictions regard
ing the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. The credit agreement alsocontains customary representations and warranties.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As
 of December 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future materialeffect on our consolidated financial con
dition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.We
 have  a  cash  pooling  arrangement  with  a  financial  institution  for  cash  management  purposes.  This  arrangement  allows  for  cashwithdrawals
 from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“AggregateCash Deposits”). This arrangement also
 allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The netbalance
 of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expenseor
 income under the arrangement. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of $3.7 billion in aggregate cash deposits, partially offset by $3.5 billionin cash withdrawals, held within the fin
ancial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.Litigation and Other Legal Matters
 
Overview
We
 are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek anindeterminate
 amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue theestimated
 liability in our financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, inour
 judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue thelow
 end  of  the  range.  For  those  proceedings  in  which  an  unfavorable  outcome  is  reasonably  possible  but  not  probable,  we  have  disclosed  anestimate of the reasonably possible loss or
 range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of lossesarising
 directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) is not material. If we cannot estimate theprobable
 or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of aproceedi
ng, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remediessought
 by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverseimpact
 on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Overview, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses thatcould potentially result from the application of such n
on-monetary remedies.Amounts
 accrued  for  legal  and  regulatory  proceedings  for  which  we  believe  a  loss  is  probable  were  not  material  for  the  year  endedDecember
 31,  2021.  We  have  concluded,  based  on  currently  available  information,  that  reasonably  possible  losses  arising  directly  from  theproceedi
ngs (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. However,legal
 and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved againstus
 in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the impact on our operating results or financial condition for thatreporting period could be material. Lega
l fees are expensed as incurred.101

General Matte
rsThird
 parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. Weare subject to patent disputes, and expect that we could be sub
ject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our businessas
 our  products  and  services  continue  to  expand  in  scope  and  complexity.  Such  claims  may  be  brought  directly  or  indirectly  against  us  and/oragainst
 our customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposureto
 such claims as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business. We have in the past beenforced
 to litigate such claims. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, theLanham
 Act and the Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as we expand the scope of our business (both in terms of therange of products and services that we offer and
 our geographical operations) and become subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying lawswith
 respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. We believe that additional lawsuitsalleging that we have violate
d patent, copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us. Intellectual property claims, whether meritorious or not, aretime
 consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business or could require us to enterinto costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorab
le terms.From
 time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by ourusers
 (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or policies, that our practices, prices,rules,
 policies or customer/user agreements violate applicable law or that we have acted unfairly and/or not acted in conformity with such practices,prices,
 rules,  policies  or  agreements.  Further,  the  number  and  significance  of  these  disputes  and  inquiries  are  increasing  as  the  political  andregulatory
 landscape changes and, as we have grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope (both in terms of the range of products andservices
 that  we  offer  and  our  geographical  operations)  and  our  products  and  services  have  increased  in  complexity.  Any  claims  or  regulatoryactions
 against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage awards (including statutory damages forcertain
 causes  of  action  in  certain  jurisdictions),  injunctive  relief  or  increased  costs  of  doing  business  through  adverse  judgment  or  settlement,require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, require significa
nt amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significantoperational resources or otherwise harm our business.
From
 time to time, the Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies, typically for potentialmisconduct
 by sellers on the Company’s Marketplace platforms. More recently, the Company has received subpoenas or requests for informationfrom
 government agencies related to potential liability of the Company for products sold by sellers on the Marketplace platforms. The Companygenerally
 responds to government subpoenas and requests in the ordinary course of business and in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner.These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in consid
erable costs being incurred by the Company.In
 this  regard,  the  Company  has  responded  to  inquiries  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  regarding  products  sold  on  the  Marketplaceplatforms
 alleged to violate certain laws and regulations, including regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency and, separately, regulationsof
 the  Drug  Enforcement  Agency.  If  the  Company  is  found  to  be  liable  for  such  activities  on  the  Marketplace,  it  could  be  subject  to  monetarydamages,
 changes in our business practices, or other remedies that could have a material adverse impact on our business. At  this time, we areunable
 to estimate the possible loss because the matters are still under investigation and involve novel legal questions relevant to the Company’spotential
 liability. Given the uncertainties involved, the ultimate resolution of these matters may be material to our operating results for a particularperiod, depending on, among oth
er factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our net income or loss for that period.Indemnification Provisions
We
 entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationshipof
 the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal,which may
 be significant. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and ourindemnity obligations to PayPa
l may be significant.102

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
In
 addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. Theseagreements require
 us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may becomesubject as a result of their affiliation with us.
In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnificat
ion provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which wehave
 commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application programming interface license agreements. Under thesecontracts,

Note 13 — Stockholders’ Equity
Preferred Stock
We
 are authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue preferred stock in one or more series; to establish the numberof
 shares included within each series; to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any relatedqualifications,
 limitations or restrictions; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series (but not below the number of shares of aseries
 then outstanding) without any further vote or action by our stockholders. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were 10 million shares of$0.001 par value preferred stock authorized for issuance, and n
o shares issued or outstanding.Common Stock
Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issu
e 3.6 billion shares of common stock.Stock Repurchase Programs
Our
 stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and,subject to market
 conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstandingshare
 count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privatelynegotiat
ed transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deemsappropri
ate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminatedat
 any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate andregulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and mana
gement’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash. In
 January 2019, our Board authorized a $4.0 billion stock repurchase program, in January 2020 our Board authorized an additional $5.0billion
 stock repurchase program, in February 2021 our Board authorized an additional $4.0 billion stock repurchase program and in  August 2021our
 Board authorized an additional $3.0  billion stock  repurchase program. These  stock repurchase programs have no expiration from the date ofauthorization.
In February 2022, our Board authorized an additi
onal $4.0 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization.On
 October 29, 2021, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (the “2021 ASR Agreements”) with two financial institutions(each
 a “2021 ASR Counterparty”), as part of our share repurchase program. Under the 2021 ASR Agreements, we paid an aggregate amount of$2.5
 billion to the 2021 ASR Counterparties and received an initial delivery of approximately 29.3 million shares of our common stock, which wererecorded
 as a $2,125 million increase to treasury stock. In December 2021, the 2021 ASR Agreement with one of the 2021 ASR Counterpartiessettled
 and  resulted  in  a  delivery  of  approximately  3.4  million  additional  shares  of  our  common  stock,  which  were  recorded  as  a  $187.5  millionincrease
 to treasury stock. The remaining $187.5 million was evaluated as an unsettled forward contract indexed to our own stock, classified withinstockholders’ equity.
Subsequ
ent to December 31, 2021, the 2021 ASR Agreement with the remaining 2021 ASR Counterparty settled and resulted in a delivery ofapproximately 3.3 million additio
nal shares of our common stock. The related forward contract was settled and recorded as a $187.5 million increaseto
 treasury stock. In total under the 2021 ASR Agreements, approximately 36.0 million shares were repurchased at an average price per share of$69.43.

Note 14 — Employee Benefit Plans
Equity Incentive Plans
We
 have equity incentive plans under which we grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based
 restricted  stock  units  (“PBRSUs”),  stock  payment  awards,  performance  share  units  and  total  shareholder  return  performance  share  units(“TSR
 PSUs”), to our directors, officers and employees. As of December 31, 2021, 755 million shares were authorized under our equity incentiveplans and 40 million shares were av
ailable for future grant.RSU
 awards granted to eligible employees under our equity incentive plans generally vest in annual or quarterly installments over a period ofthree
 to five years, are subject to the employees’ continuing service to us and do n ot have an expiration date.In
 2021, 2020 and 2019, certain executives were eligible to receive PBRSUs. PBRSU awards are subject to performance and time-basedvesting
 requirements.  The  target  number  of  shares  subject  to  the  PBRSU  award  are  adjusted  based  on  our  business  performance  measuredagainst
 the  performance  goals  approved  by  the  Compensation  and  Human  Capital  Committee  at  the  beginning  of  the  performance  period.Generally,
 if the performance criteria are satisfied, one-half of the award vests in March following the end of the performance period and the otherhalf of the award vests in March of the following year.
During
 2020, our Chief Executive  Officer  was granted  TSR PSUs with performance  and time-based  vesting  requirements.  The number  ofstock
 units  ultimately  received  will  depend  on  our  total  shareholder  return  relative  to  that  of  the  S&P  500  index  over two  and  three  yearmeasurement
 periods. The target number of shares will be divided into two tranches, with each tranche corresponding to 50% of the target shares.The first tranche will vest in full on the second anniversary of the grant date and sec
ond tranche will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.Deferred Stock Units
Prior
 to  December  31,  2016,  we  granted  deferred  stock  units  to  each  non-employee  director  (other  than  Mr.  Omidyar)  at  the  time  of  ourannual
 meeting of stockholders and to new non-employee directors upon their election to the Board. Each deferred stock unit award granted to anew
 non-employee director upon election to the Board vests 25% one year from the date of grant, and at a rate of 2.08% per month thereafter. Inaddition,
 directors were permitted to elect to receive, in lieu of annual retainer and committee chair fees and at the time these fees would otherwisebe
 payable, fully vested deferred stock units with an initial value equal to the amount based on the fair market value of common stock at the date ofgrant.
 Following termination of a non-employee director’s service on the Board, deferred stock units granted prior to August 1, 2013 are payable instock
 or cash (at our election), while deferred stock units granted on or after August 1, 2013 are payable solely in stock. As of December 31, 2021,there
 were  approximately  109,993  deferred  stock  units  outstanding,  which  are  included  in  our  restricted  stock  unit  activity  below.  As  ofDecember 31, 2016, we no longer grant deferred stock units.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We
 have  an  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  (“ESPP”)  for  all  eligible  employees.  Under  the  plan,  shares  of  our  common  stock  may  bepurchased
 over  an  offering  period  with  a  maximum  duration  of  two  years  at  85%  of  the  lower  of  the  fair  market  value  on  the  first  day  of  theapplicable
 offering period or on the last day of the six-month purchase period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 10%of
 their eligible compensation during an offering period. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, employees purchased approximately 2 million, 3 million and 3million
 shares under this plan at average prices of $38.93, $25.93 and $25.24 per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 3million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance.

 of December 31, 2021, our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $13million,
 $43 million and $248 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations underSection
 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards willbegin to expire in 2024 and 20
23, respectively. The carryforward periods on our foreign net operating loss carryforwards are as follows: $5 million donot
 expire and $243 million are subject to valuation allowance and begin to expire in 2027. As of December 31, 2021, state tax credit carryforwardsfor income tax purposes were approximately $175 milli
on. Most of the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely.As
 of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarilyto operating losses in certain non-U.S. jurisdictio
ns and certain state tax credits that we believe are not likely to be realized.We
 have recognized the tax consequences of all foreign unremitted earnings and management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvestthe
 unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of the balance sheet date. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $697 million and$791
 million, respectively, of our liability for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was included in other liabilities on our consolidated balancesheet.
 We have not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis differences in our investments in our foreign subsidiaries that are unrelated tounremitted
 earnings. These basis differences will be indefinitely reinvested. A determination of the unrecognized deferred taxes related to theseother components of our outside basis difference is not practicabl
e.In connection with the transfer
 of our Classifieds business on June 24, 2021 we recorded $2.1 billion of income tax expense as part of incomefrom
 discontinued  operations,  of  which  $1.7  billion  was  a  deferred  tax  liability  for  the  outside  basis  difference  related  to  our  receipt  of  Adevintashares.
 Through the remainder of 2021, the deferred tax liability has decreased with the change in fair value of the Adevinta investment, which hasbeen recorded in income from continuing op
erations following the transaction close date through December 31, 2021.109

 benefits indemnified by PayPal. If total unrecognized tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $318 million.Of
 this amount, approximately $46 million of unrecognized tax benefit is indemnified by PayPal and a corresponding receivable would be reducedupon
 a future realization. As of December 31, 2021, our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were included in other liabilities on our consolidatedbalance sheet.
We
 recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. In 2021 and 2020, tax benefits of $6 millionand
 $10  million,  respectively,  were  included  in  tax  expense  for  interest  and  penalties.  The  amount  of  interest  and  penalties  accrued  as  ofDecember 31, 2021 and 2020 was ap
proximately $46 million and $39 million, respectively. 
We
 are  subject  to  both  direct  and  indirect  taxation  in  the  U.S.  and  various  states  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  We  are  under  examination  bycertain
 tax  authorities  for  the  2010  to  2020  tax  years.  We  believe  that  adequate  amounts  have  been  reserved  for  any  adjustments  that  mayultimately
 result from these or other examinations. The material jurisdictions where we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities for taxyears after 2009 include, among others, the U.S. (Federal and Californ
ia), Germany, Israel, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 
Although
 the  timing  of  the  resolution  and/or  closure  of  audits  is  highly  uncertain,  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  the  balance  of  grossunrecognized
 tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to examinationand
 the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognizedtax benefits.

be made in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
(b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if and to the extent the Company shall determine
that
 the terms of the Plan may result in the failure of the Plan, or amounts deferred by or for any Participant under thePlan,
 to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  Section  409A  of  the  Code,  or  any  applicable  regulations  or  guidancepromulgated

(3)    Any cancellation or termination of any vested interest in any Participant’s Accounts, with
immediate payment to the Participant of the amount otherwise payable to such Participant.
Any such amendment, modification, cancellation, or termination of the Plan may adversely affect the rights of a
Participant without the Participant’s consent.
9.5
Designation of Beneficiary . (a)
Each Participant shall have the right to designate, revoke and redesignate Beneficiaries hereunder and to direct payment of his Distributable Amount to such Beneficiaries upon his death.
(b)
Designation, revocation and redesignation of Beneficiaries must be made in writing in accordance with the procedures established by the Committee and shall be effective upon delivery to the Committee.
(c)
No designation of a Beneficiary other than the Participant’s spouse shall be valid unless consented in writing by such spouse. 
If there is no Beneficiary designation in effect, or the designated beneficiary does not survive the Participant, then the Participant’s spouse shall be the Beneficiary. 
If there is no surviving spouse, the duly appointed and currently acting personal representative of the Participant’s estate (which shall include either the Participant’s probate
estate or living trust) shall be the Beneficiary.
(d)
After the Participant’s death, any Beneficiary (other than the Participant’s estate) who is to receive installment payments may designate a secondary beneficiary to receive amounts due under this Plan to the Beneficiary
in the event of the Beneficiary’s death prior to receiving full payment from the Plan. 
If no secondary beneficiary is designated, it shall be the Beneficiary’s estate.
9.6
Governing Law . Subject to ERISA, this Plan shall be construed, governed and administered in accordance with the laws of
the State of California.
9.7
Compliance with Code Section 162(m) It is the intent of the Company that any Compensation which is deferred under the Plan by a person who is, with
respect to the year of distribution, deemed by the Committee to be a “covered employee” within the meaning of Code
Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder, which Compensation constitutes either “qualified performance-based
compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder or compensation not otherwise
subject to the limitation on deductibility under Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder, shall not, as a result of
deferral hereunder, become compensation with respect to which the Company in fact would not be entitled to a tax
deduction under Code Section 162(m). 
If the Company determines in good faith prior to a Change in Control that there is a reasonable likelihood that any compensation paid to a Participant for a taxable year of the Company would not be
deductible by the Company solely by reason of the limitation under Code Section 162(m), then to the extent deemed
necessary by the Committee to ensure that the entire amount of any distribution to the Participant pursuant to this Plan
prior to the Change in Control is deductible, the Company may defer all or any portion of a distribution under this Plan.
Any amounts deferred pursuant to this limitation shall continue to be credited/debited with additional amounts in
accordance with Article IV, even if such amount is being paid out in installments. 
The amounts so deferred and amounts credited thereon shall be distributed to the Participant or his Beneficiary (in the event of the Participant’s death)
commencing as soon as reasonably practicable following the Plan Year in which such Participant’s Separation from
Service, Disability or Death occurs, or if earlier, the effective date of a Change in Control. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, this Section shall not apply to any distributions made after a Change in Control.

9.8
Payments on Behalf of Persons Under Incapacity . In the event that any amount becomes payable under the Plan to a person who, in the sole judgment of the
Committee, is considered by reason of physical or mental condition to be unable to give a valid receipt therefore, the
Committee may direct that such payment be made to any person found by the Committee, in its sole judgment, to have
assumed the care of such person. 
Any payment made pursuant to such termination shall constitute a full release and discharge of the Committee and the Company.
9.9
Limitation of Rights Neither the establishment of the Plan nor any modification thereof, nor the creating of any fund or account,
nor the payment of any benefits shall be construed as giving to any Participant or other person any legal or equitable
right against the Company except as provided in the Plan. 
In no event shall the terms of employment of, or membership on the Board by, any Participant be modified or in any way be effected by the provisions of the Plan.
9.10
Exempt ERISA Plan The Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan maintained primarily to provide deferred compensation
benefits for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of Sections 201, 301
and 401 of ERISA and therefore to be exempt from Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA.
9.11
Notice Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Committee under the Plan shall be sufficient if
in writing and hand delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the principal office of the Company, directed to
the attention of the General Counsel and Secretary of the Company. 
Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or
certification.
9.12
Errors and Misstatements In the event of any misstatement or omission of fact by a Participant to the Committee or any clerical error
resulting in payment of benefits in an incorrect amount, the Committee shall promptly cause the amount of future
payments to be corrected upon discovery of the facts and shall pay or, if applicable, cause the Plan to pay, the
Participant or any other person entitled to payment under the Plan any underpayment in a lump sum or to recoup any
overpayment from future payments to the Participant or any other person entitled to payment under the Plan in such
amounts as the Committee shall direct or to proceed against the Participant or any other person entitled to payment
under the Plan for recovery of any such overpayment.

Pronouns and Plurality The masculine pronoun shall include the feminine pronoun, and the singular the plural where the context

9.14
Severability In the event that any provision of the Plan shall be declared unenforceable or invalid for any reason, such
unenforceability or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of the Plan but shall be fully severable, and the
Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such unenforceable or invalid provision had never been included herein.
9.15
Status The establishment and maintenance of, or allocations and credits to, the Accounts of any Participant shall
