Las Vegas, Nevada, February 8, 2023 – MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) (“MGM Resorts” 
or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022.  
 
“We achieved our fifth consecutive quarter of record -breaking Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted 
Property EBITDAR in the fourth quarter,” said Bill Hornbuckle, Chief Executive Officer and President 
of MGM Resorts. “What we accomplished in 2022 is nothing short of remarkable, and is a testament to 
our strategi c plan, scale, brand strength, talented team, loyalty program, and the diverse geographies and 
channels in which we operate. We believe that there is strong momentum in our business and our 2023 
outlook remains bright, driven by a robust events calendar do mestically, MGM China’s rapid year -to-
date return to profitability and BetMGM's ongoing improvement in 2023.”  
 
“We achieved exceptional results in the fourth quarter and remain optimistic in our outlook for this year. 
We are also focused on free cash flow and believe our company presents a compelling yield, especially 
when taking into account the value in our share  price for excess cash, our ownership value of MGM 
China and BetMGM,” said Jonathan Halkyard, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of MGM Resorts. 
“Our share buyback program continues to return capital to shareholders as we have already repurchased 
4 mill ion shares for $164 million  year-to-date, adding to the 76 million  shares we repurchased in 2022 
and totaling approximately $4.7 billion  since 2021. Beyond this, our Board of Directors authorized an 
additional $2 billion for share buybacks.”

1."Adjusted EPS" is diluted ear nings or loss per share adjusted to exclude property transactions, net, preopening and start -up 
expenses, gain on REIT transactions, net, gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net, foreign currency gain/loss related to 
MGM China's U.S. dollar -denominated de bt, net gain/loss related to equity investments for which the Company has elected 
the fair value option of ASC 825 and equity investments accounted for under ASC 321 for which there is a readily 
determinable fair value and net gain/loss related to the Comp any's debt securities, change in the fair value of foreign currency 
contracts, mark -to-market  adjustments  related  to  MGP's  unhedged  interest  rate  swaps, mark -to-market adjustments 
related to CityCenter's unhedged interest rate swaps recorded within  non-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates, and 
gain  related  to  CityCenter's  sale  of Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates.  
 
Adjusted EPS is a non -GAAP measure and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures 
because management believes this measure is useful in providing period -to-period comparisons of the results of the 
Company's continuing operations to assist investors in reviewing the Company's operating performance ove r time. 
Management believes that while certain items excluded from Adjusted EPS may be recurring in nature and should not be 
disregarded in evaluating the Company's earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when comparing current 
performance  to prior periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or 
events. Also, management believes certain excluded items, and items further discussed in footnote 2 below, may not relate 
specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an 
alternative to GAAP earnings per share as an indicator of the Company's performance. In addition, Adjusted EPS may not be 
defined in the same manner by all comp anies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non -GAAP financial 
measures of other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EPS to diluted earnings per share can be found under "Adjusted 
Diluted Earnings Per Share" included in this relea se. 
 
2."Adjusted EBITDAR" is earnings before interest and other non -operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and 
amortization, preopening and start -up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, gain on 
consolidation of Cit yCenter, net, rent expense related to triple -net operating leases and ground leases, gain related to 
CityCenter's sale of Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates, and income from unconsolidated 
affiliates related to investments in  real estate ventures.  
 
"Adjusted Property EBITDAR" is the Company's reportable segment GAAP measure, which management utilizes as the 
primary profit measure for its reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a 
measure defined as earnings before interest and other non -operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, 
preopening and start -up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, rent expense related to triple -net 
operat ing leases and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, and 
also excludes gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net, gain related to CityCenter's sale of Harmon land recorded within 
income from unc onsolidated affiliates, corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each 
operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminated in consolidation.  
 
"Same -Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR" is Adjusted Property EBITDAR further adjusted to exclude the Adjusted 
Property EBITDAR of acquired operating segments from the date of acquisition through the end of the reporting period a nd 
 
 
Page 8 of 15  
 
 to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of disposed operating segme nts from the beginning of the reporting period 
through the date of disposition.  Accordingly, the Company has excluded the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of The 
Cosmopolitan for periods subsequent to its acquisition on May 17, 2022, Aria for periods subsequent t o its acquisition on 
September 27, 2021, and The Mirage for the periods prior to its disposition on December 19, 2022 in Same -Store Adjusted 
Property EBITDAR for the periods indicated, as applicable.  
 
Same -Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a non -GAAP meas ure and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to 
reported GAAP measures because management believes this measure is useful in providing meaningful period -to-period 
comparisons of the results of the Company's operations for operating segments tha t were consolidated for the full period 
presented to assist users of the financial statements in reviewing operating performance over time. Same -Store Adjusted 
Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an 
alternative to the Company's reportable segment GAAP measure or net income, or as an alternative to any other measure 
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP 
basis, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Same -Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR may 
not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non -GAAP 
financial m easures of other companies, and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of the Company's reportable 
segment Adjusted Property EBITDAR GAAP measure to Same -Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is included in the 
financial schedules in this release.  
 
"Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR" and "Table Games Hold Adjusted Las 
Vegas Strip Resorts Same -Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR" are supplemental non -GAAP financial measures, that, in 
addition to the reasons descri bed above for the presentation of Adjusted Property EBITDAR and Same -Store Adjusted 
Property EBITDAR, are presented to adjust for the impact of certain variances in table games win percentages compared to 
the mid -point of the expected ranges. Table Games H old Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR and 
Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same -Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR are calculated by applying a 
win percentage of 30.0% for Baccarat and 21.0% for non -Baccarat games to the respective table games drops for the quarter, 
which represents the mid -point of the expected ranges of 25.0% to 35.0% for Baccarat and 19.0% to 23.0% for non -Baccarat 
at the Las Vegas Strip Resorts properties. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same -Store Adjusted Property 
EBITDAR is Same -Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR adjusted to exclude the hold adjustments related to such acquired and 
disposed operating segments for the respective periods. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Res orts Adjusted 
Property EBITDAR and Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same -Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR are 
also adjusted for the gaming taxes, bad debt expense, discounts and other incentives that would have been incurred or 
avoided when  applying the win percentages noted above to the respective gaming volumes. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las 
Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR and Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same -Store 
Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be  viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or 
as an alternative to the Company's reportable segment GAAP measure or net income, or to any other measure determined in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting princip les, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis, and is 
provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted 
Property EBITDAR and Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Re sorts Same -Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR may 
not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non -GAAP 
financials measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. A reconcili ation of the Company's reportable 
segment Adjusted Property EBITDAR GAAP measure to Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same -Store 
Adjusted Property EBITDAR is included in the financial schedules in this release.  
 
Adjusted EBITDAR information  is a non -GAAP measure that is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating 
metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes this 
measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, finan cial institutions, and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of 
gaming companies. Management believes that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature 
and should not be disregarded in evaluation of the Company's earning s performance, it is useful to exclude such items when 
analyzing current results and trends. Also, management believes excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends 
or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start -up exp enses will be significantly different in periods 
when the Company is developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period 
lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Prope rty transactions, net includes normal 
recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within the Company's resorts, but also 
 
 
Page 9 of 15  
 
 includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impai rment charges on entire asset 
groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, 
management excludes rent expense related to triple -net operating leases and ground leases. Management believes ex cluding 
rent expense related to triple -net operating leases and ground leases provides useful information to analysts, lenders, financial 
institutions, and investors when valuing the Company, as well as comparing the Company's results to other gaming 
compa nies, without regard to differences in capital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming 
companies may or may not include triple -net operating leases or ground leases. However, as discussed herein, Adjusted 
EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, an indicator of the Company's performance, 
considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, or as an alternative to cash flows  
from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis and excludes certain 
expenses, including the rent expense relate d to triple -net operating leases and ground leases, and is provided for the limited 
purposes discussed herein. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted 
EBITDAR may calculate Adjusted EBITDAR in a different manner and such differences may be material. The Company has 
significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple -net lease and ground 
lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not refl ected in Adjusted EBITDAR.  
 
A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDAR is included in the financial schedules in this release.  
 
"Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Net Revenues" and "Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas St rip
