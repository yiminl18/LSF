Direct-Store-Delivery
We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages, foods and snacks directly to retail
stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our indepen dent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with
maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion
and merchandising.

Table of Contents
Customer W arehouse
Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses. These less costly
systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover .
Distributor Networks
We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater
distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and
vending business distributes beverages , foods and snacks to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party
foodservice and vending distributors and operators.
Ingredients and Other Supplies
The princi pal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice
concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour , grapefruit and other fruits, oats, oranges, potatoes, raw milk, rice,
seasonings, sucralos e, sugar , vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our
key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephtha late (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic
beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperboard
cartons. Fuel and natural gas are also important commodities for us due to their use in our facilities and the vehicles delivering our
products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant
continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and
commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk
through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and
futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated  through purchases from multiple geographies and
suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make
investments to improve the sustainabili ty and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including by developing our initiative to
advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it globally . See Note 10 to our consolidated financial
statements for additional information on how we manage our exposure to commodity costs.
Our Brands and Intellectual Pr operty Rights
We own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses, including Agusha, Amp Energy, Aquafina,
Aquafina Flavorsplash, Aunt Jemima, Cap’n Crunch, Cheetos, Chester ’s, Chipsy , Chudo, Cracker Jack, Crunchy , Diet Mountain

long-term licenses to use valuable trade marks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Dole and Ocean Spray .
We also distribute Rockstar Energy drinks, Muscle Milk protein shakes and various DPSG brands, including Dr Pepper in certain
markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain
trademarks, such as Lipton,
5
Table of Contents
Sabra and Starbucks. Trademarks rema in valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize
correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrange ments, the use of many of our trademarks in such
contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on
merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness.
We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certai n of our products, their packaging, the processes for
their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to
others.
Seasonality
Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. For instance, our beverage sales are higher during the warmer months and certain
food and dairy sales are higher in the cooler months. Weekly beverage and snack sales are generally highest in the third quarter due
to seasona l and holiday-related patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter . However , taken as a whole, seasonality has not had
a material impact on our consolidated financial results.
Our Customers
Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores,
discount/dollar store s, mass merchandisers, membership stores, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among
others. W e normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our
trademarks within a specific geographic  area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for
concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality . We also grant
distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.
We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the
consumer . For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees,
promotions and displays. For our indepe ndent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually
with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new
product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include coupons, pricing discounts and
promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent
bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as point-
of-purchase materia ls, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending  and cooler equipment placement programs support
the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually .
Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, and the current economic environment
continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2015 , sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Wal-Mart), including Sam’ s Club
(Sam’ s), represented approximately 13% of our total net revenue. Our top five retail customers represented approximat ely 32% of
our 2015  net revenue in North America, with Wal-Mart (including Sam’ s) representing approximately 18%. These percentages
include concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.
See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our customers, including our independent bottlers.

Our Competition
Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of
international beverag e, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multip le geographies, as well as regional, local and private
label manu facturers and other competitors. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-
Cola Com pany is our primary beverage competitor . Other beverage, food and snack competitors include, but are not limited to,
DPSG, Kellogg Company , The Kraft Heinz Company , Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A.,
Red Bull GmbH and Snyder ’s-Lance, Inc.
Many of our food and snack products hold significant leadership positions in the food and snack industry in the United States and
worldwide. In 2015, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 24% and 20%, respectively , of the U.S. liquid
refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However ,
The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States.
Our beverage, food and snack products  compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition, taste, price, quality , product variety ,
innovation, distribu tion, advertising, marketing and promotional activity , packaging, convenience, service and the ability to
anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness.
Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new
products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging, pricing, increased efficiency
in production techniques, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe
that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution
network, allows us to compete ef fectively .
Resear ch and Development
We engag e in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation
globally . These activities principally involve: development of new ingredients and products; reformulation and improvement in the
quality and appeal of existing products ; improvement and modernization of manufacturing processes; improvements in product
quality , safety and integrity; developme nt of, and improvements in, dispensing  equipment, packaging technology , package design
and portion sizes; and efforts focused on identifying opportunities to transform, grow and broaden our product portfolio, including
by developing products with improved nutrition profiles that reduce sodium, saturated fat or added sugars, including through the use
of sweetener alternatives and flavor modifiers and innovation in existing sweeteners, and by offering more options with whole
grains, fruits and vegetables. Our research centers are located around the world, including in Brazil, China, Germany , India, Mexico,
Russia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage nutrition science, food science,
engineering and consumer insights to meet our strategy to continue to develop nutritious, convenient beverages, foods and snacks.
In 2015 , we continued to refine our beverage, food and snack portfolio to meet changing consumer demands by developing a
broader portfolio of product choices, including: launching beverage options that contain no high fructose corn syrup and are made
with natural flavors; building on our important nutrition platforms and brands – Quaker (grains), Tropicana (fruits and vegetables),
Gatorade (sports nutrition for athletes) and Naked Juice (juices and smoothies); expanding our whole grain products globally; and
expanding our portfolio of nutritious products in growing categories, such as dairy, hummus and other refrigerated dips, and baked
grain snacks. We also continued to develop and implement new technologies to enhance the quality and value of our current and
future products. In addition, we continued to make investments to reduce our impact on the environment, including: efforts to
conserve raw materials and energy, such as by working to achieve reductio ns in greenhouse gas emissions across our global
businesses, by helping to protect and conserve
7
Table of Contents
global water supplies especially in water -stressed areas (including conserving water within our operations and promoting the
reduction of water use in our agricultural supply chain), and by incorporating into our operations improvements in the sustainability
and resour ces of our agricultural supply chain; efforts to reduce waste generated by our operations and disposed of in landfills;
efforts to recycle containers; efforts to use renewable resources; and efforts to optimize package technology and design to make our
packaging increasingly sustainable with lower environmental impact.
Research and development costs were $754 million , $718 million  and $665 million  in 2015 , 2014  and 2013 , respectively , and are
reported within selling, general and administrative expenses. Consumer researc h is excluded from such research and development
costs and included in other marketing costs.
Regulatory Envir onment and Envir onmental Compliance
The conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display , advertising, marketing, labeling, content,
quality and safety of our products, occupational health and safety practices, transportation and use of many of our products, are
subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well
as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which our
products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that
apply to our businesses.
We are required to comply with a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, includ ing but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health
Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compens ation and Liability Act; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws
and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment
practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity , such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the
National Labor Relations Act; customs and foreign trade laws and regulations; and laws regulating the sale of certain of our products
in schools . In our business dealings, we are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act
and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and
regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that, unless a safe harbor
level exists and has been met, a specific  warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as
having been found to cause cancer or birth defects.
We are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside  the United States, including but not limited to laws
and regulations governing food safety , occupational health and safety , comp etition, anti-corruption and data privacy . In many
jurisdictions, compliance with competiti on laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions,
as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside
counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, taxes, labeling requirements
or other limitations on, or regulations pertaining to, the sale of certain of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or
attributes of, our products or commodi ties used in the production of our products, including certain of our products that contain
added sugars, sodium or saturated fat, exceed a specified caloric content, or include specified ingredients such as caffeine. For
example, taxes on sugar -sweetened beverages were imposed in Mexico and Berkeley , California; the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration is considering requiring nutrition labels to include information about added sugars; and Brazil and Vermont have
enacted legislation requiring labeling of products that contain genetically modified
8
Table of Contents
ingredients. In addition, a number of other jurisdictions in the United States and outside the United States are considering similar
measures. Regulator s may also restrict  the use of benefit programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to
purchase certain beverages and foods. In addition, legislation has been enacted in certain U.S. states and in certain other countries
where our products are sold that requires collection and recycling of containers or that prohibits the sale of our beverages in certain
non-refillable contai ners, unless a depo sit or other fee is charged. It is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements
may be proposed or enacted in the future . In addition, as our products are made,  manufactured, distributed and sold in more than 200
countries and territories, we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
Economic and political conditions may result in changes in tax rates, and existing laws on how U.S. multinational corporations are
taxed on foreign earnings are subject to changes in interpretation and enforcem ent, which could affect our financial performance.
The cost of complia nce with such U.S. and foreign laws has not had a material financial impact on our consolidated results of
operations.
We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business,
including laws related to water consum ption and treatment, wastewater dischar ge and air emissions. In the United States, our
facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other feder al and state laws regarding handling, storage, release
and dispos al of wastes generated on-site and sent to third-party owned and operated off-site licensed facilities and our facilities
outside the United States must comply with similar laws and regulations. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental
compliance requirem ents, and we have internal programs in place to enhance our global environmental compliance. We have made,
and plan to continue  making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. While these expenditures have not had a
material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and
any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could affect our financial performance. In addition, we and our
subsidiaries are subject to environmenta l remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation
and related  indemnif ication obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of
businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with
certainty , environmental compliance costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position.
In addition  to the discussion in this section, see under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below “Changes in, or failure to comply with, laws
and regula tions applicable to our produ cts or our business operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations.”, “Imposition of new taxes, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.”, “Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be
adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in developing and emerging markets or as a result of unstable political
conditions, civil unrest or other develop ments and risks in the markets where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or
sold” and “Climate change or water scarcity, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change or water scarcity ,
may negatively af fect our business and operations or damage our reputation.”
The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (ITRA) requir es disclosure of certain activities relating to Iran by
PepsiCo or its affiliates that occurred during our 2015  fisca l year. As previously disclosed, one of our foreign subsidiaries
historically maintained a small office in Iran, which provided sales support to independent bottlers in Iran in connection with in-
country sales of foreign-owned beverage brands, and which was not in contra vention of any applicable U.S. sanctions laws. The
office ceased all commercial activity since the enactment of ITRA. During our 2015 fiscal year, our foreign subsidiary received a
license

from the U.S. Treasury Department’ s Office of Foreign Assets Control authorizing it to engage in activities related to the winding
down of the office in Iran and completed the process of winding down its office. The foreign subsidiary did not engage in any
activities in Iran other than wind-down activities in 2015 , or have any revenues or profits attributable to activities in Iran during
2015 .
Employees
As of December 26, 2015 , we and our consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 263,000  people worldwide, including
approximately 110,000  people within the United States. In certain countries, our employment levels are subject to seasonal
variations. We or our subsidiaries are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. We expect that we will be able to
renegotiate these collective bargaining  agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire.  We believe that relations with our
employees are generally good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following
factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our
common stock. The following information should be read together and in conjunction with “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Item 1.
Business,” “Item 7. Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” our consolidated
financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. The risks below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations or the price of our common stock.
Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to innovate
or market our products effectively , and any significant reduction in demand could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations.
We are a global food and beverage company operating in highly competitive  categories and markets and we rely on continued
demand for our products. To generate revenues and profits, we must sell produ cts that appeal to our customers and to consumers.
Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in
reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position and could adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operatio ns. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts
in consumer trends and preferences, including increased demand for products that meet the needs of consumers who are concerned
with: health and wellness (including products that have less sodium, added sugars and saturated fat); convenience (including
responding to changes in in-home and on-the-go consumption patterns); or the location of origin or source of the ingredients and
products. Our success also depends on: product quality; our ability to extend our portfolio of products in growing markets and
categories; our ability to respond to cultural differences and regional consumer preferences; our ability to monitor and adjust our use
of ingredie nts to respond to applicable local regulations; our ability to develop or acquire new products that are responsive to certain
consumer preferences; our ability to develop a broader portfolio of product choices and continue to increase non-carbonated
beverage offerings and other alternatives to traditional carbonated beverage offerings; our ability to develop sweetener alternatives
and innov ation; our ability to improve the production and packaging of our products; and our ability to respond to competitive
product and pricing pressures. For example, our growth rate may be adversely  affected if we are unable to maintain or grow our
current share of the liquid refreshment beverage market or snacks market, or if demand for our products does not grow in developing
and emer ging markets.
In general, changes in consumption in our product categories or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our
products. Consumer preferences have been evolving, and are expected to continue to evolve, due to a variety of factors, including:
the aging of the general population; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile of certain of our products,
including their caloric content, or percep tions (whether or not valid) regarding the health effects of ingredients or substances present
in certain of our products, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, artificial flavors and colors, artificial sweeteners, aspartame, caffeine, high-
fructose corn syrup, saturated fat, sodium, sugar , trans fats or other product ingredients, substances or attributes, including
genetically engineer ed ingredients; taxes or other restrictions imposed on our products; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding
packaging materials , such as with respect to the environmental sustainability or chemical makeup thereof; changes in package or
portion size; changes in social trends that impact travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns; changes in weather patterns or seasonal
consumption cycles; negative publicity (whether or not valid) resulting from regulatory action, litigation against us or other
companies in our industry or negative or inaccurate posts or comments in the media, including social media, about us, our products
or advertising campaigns and marketing programs; consumer
11
Table of Contents
perception of social media posts or other information disseminated by us or our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers,
distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; consumer perceptio n of our employees, agents, customers, suppliers,
bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or the business practices of such parties; or a downturn in economic
conditions. Any of these changes may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase our products.
Our continued success is also dependent on our product and marketing innovat ion, including: maintaining a robust pipeline of new
products; improving the quality of existing products; and the effectiveness of our product packaging and distribution, advertising
campaigns and marketing programs, including our ability to successfully adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including
through use of social media and online advertising campaigns and marketing programs.
Although we devote significant resources to the items mentioned above, there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to
develop, launch and maintain successful new products or variants of existing products in a timely manner or our ability to correctly
anticipate or effectively react to changes in consumer preference or develop and effectively execute advertising and marketing
campaigns that appeal to customers and consumers. Our failure to make the right strategic investments to drive innovation or
successfully launch new products or variants of existing products could decre ase demand for our existing products by negatively
affecting consumer perception of existing brands and may result in inventory write-of fs and other costs that could adversely affect
our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Changes in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our busin esses are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the
United States, as well as government entities and agencies outside the United States, including laws and regulations relating to the
production, content,  quality , safety , storage, distribution, sale, display , advertising, marketing, labeling, transportation and use of
products, as well as our occupational health and safety practices. Many of these laws and regulations have differing or conflicting
legal standards across the various mark ets where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold and, in certain markets,
such as developing and emer ging markets, may be less developed or certain. In addition, these laws and regulations and related
interpretations may change, sometimes dramatically , as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events.
Such changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling, advertising and marketing practices;
laws regar ding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products; laws and programs restricting the sale and
advertising of certain of our products; laws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients or substances in,
or attributes of, certa in of our products; laws and programs aimed at discouragin g the consumption or altering the package or portion
size of certain of our products, including laws imposing restrictions on the use of government funds or programs, such as the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to purchase certain of our produ cts; increased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased
litigation involving product claims and concerns (whether or not valid) regarding the effects on health of ingredients or substances
in, or attributes of, certain of our products, including without limitation those found in energy drinks; state consumer protection
laws; taxation requi rements, including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other limitations on the
sale of our products; accounting rules and interpretations; competition laws; anti-corruption laws; employment laws; privacy laws;
laws regulating the price we may charge for our products; laws regulating water rights and access to and use of water or utilities; and
environmental laws, including laws relating to the regulation of water treatment and dischar ge of wastewater and air emissions.

The impos ition by any jurisdiction in the United States or outside the United States of new laws, regulations or governmental policy
and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing, including taxes, labeling, product or production requirements or
other limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale or advertisement of certain of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or
attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products, may alter the environment in which we do
business and, therefore, may increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand  for our products, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, taxes on sugar -sweetened beverages were imposed in Mexico and
Berkeley , California; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering requiring nutrition labels to include information about
added sugars; and Brazil and Vermont have enacted legislation requiring labeling of products that contain genetically modified
ingredients. In addition, a number of other jurisdictions in the United States and outside the United States are considering similar
measures. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions, other jurisdictions may follow and the
requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, may result in adverse publicity (whether or not valid). For
example, if one jurisdiction imposes a specific labeling requirement or requires a specific warning on any product that contains
certain ingredients or substances, other jurisdictions may react and impose restrictions on products containing the same ingredients
or substances, which may result in adverse publicity or increased concerns about the health implications of consumption of such
ingredients or substances in our products (whether or not valid). Changes in regulatory requirements, and competing regulations and
standards, where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, may result in higher compliance costs, capital
expenditures and higher production costs, which could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, studies are underway by third parties to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or
substances present in certain of our products, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, caffeine, added sugars and sodium. If consumer concerns
(whether or not valid) about the health implications of consumption of such ingredients or substances present in certain of our
products increase as a result of these studies, new scientific evidence, new labeling, product or production requirements or other
restrictions, or for any other reason, including adverse publicity (whether or not valid) as a result of any of the foregoing, or if we are
required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold, demand for our
products could decline, or we could be subject to lawsuits or new regulations that could affect sales of our products, any of which
could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to the conduct of our businesses due to our
competitive position  in those jurisdicti ons, as is compliance with anti-corrup tion laws. In addition, regulatory authorities under
whose laws we operate may have enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall, seizure of products or
assets or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on the sales of products in our portfolio or could lead to damage to our
reputation. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance, our
employees, supplier s, or other third parties with whom we do business could take actions, intentional or not, that violate these
policies and procedures or applicable laws or regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil
enforcement actions , including fines, penalties, disgor gement of profits or activity restrictions, any of which could result in adverse
publicity or af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environm ental remediation obligations arising in the normal
course of business, as well as environmental remediation, product liability , toxic tort and related indemnification proceedings in
connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our
subsidiaries. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current
and former properties
13
Table of Contents
of ours and our subsidiaries, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the
costs we have estim ated. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these  matters will not exceed our established liabilities or
otherwise have an adverse ef fect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Imposition of new taxes, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations.
Our produ cts are made, manufactured, distributed or sold in more than 200 countries and territories. As such, we are subject to tax
laws and regulations of various federal , state and local governments in the United States as well as to tax laws and regulations
outside the United States. The imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other limitations on the sale of our
products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our
products, could increase the cost of our products, reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether or
not valid) or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, which could
adversely affect our business, financial  condition or results of operations. If one jurisdiction imposes new or increased taxes or
limitations, other jurisdictions may follow , which may result in adverse publicity or increased concerns about the health implications
of consumption of our products (whether or not valid).
In additio n, we are subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing
authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes both within and outside the United States. Economic and political
pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or
regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could
differ from  our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
Our operations outside the United States generate a significant portion of our income and income tax associated with repatriation of
foreign earnings to the United States could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition,
many of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including countries in which we have
significant operations, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. Changes in how U.S. multinational corporations are
taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our business, financial condition or results of operations could suf fer if we are unable to compete ef fectively .
Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of
international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographic areas, as well as regional, local and
private label manufacturers and other competitors. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, our
primary beverage competitor is The Coca-Cola Company . We also compete with other large companies in each of the beverage, food
and snack categories, including DPSG , Kellogg Company , The Kraft Heinz Company , Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster
Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Snyder ’s-Lance, Inc.
Our beverage, food and snack products  compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition, taste, price, quality , product variety ,
innovation, distribu tion, advertising, marketing and promotional activity , packaging, convenience, service and the ability to
anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness.
If we are unable to ef fectively promote our
14
Table of Contents
existing products or introduce new products, if our advertising or marketing campaigns are not effective or if we are otherwise
unable to compete effectively , we may be unable to grow or maintain sales, gross margins or category share in the global market or
in various local markets or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, which may adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our busin ess, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in
developing and emerging markets or as a result of unstable political conditions, civil unrest or other developments and risks in
the markets where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold.
Our operations outside of the United States, particularly in Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Brazil, contribute
significantly to our revenue and profit ability , and we believe that these countries and other developing and emer ging markets,
including China and India, present important future growth opportunities for us. However , there can be no assurance that our
existing products, variants of our existing products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or
be successful in any particular developing or emer ging market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural dif ferences,
consumer preferences or otherwise. The following factors could reduce demand for our products in such developing and emer ging
markets: unstable economic, political or social conditions, acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest in certain of these markets
where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including Russia, Ukraine, Brazil and the Middle East; increased
competition; volatili ty in the economic growth of certain of these markets and the related impact on developed countries who export
to these markets; our inability to acquire businesses, form strategic business alliances or to make necessary infrastructure
investments; our inability to complete divestitures or refranchisings; imposition of new or increased labeling, product or production
requirements, or other restrictions; imposition of new or increased sanctions against, or other regulations restricting contact with,
certain countries in these markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, such as Russia, or imposition
of new or increased sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations operating in these markets; foreign ownership restrictions;
nationalization of our assets or the assets of our suppliers, bottlers, distribu tors, joint venture partners or other third parties;
government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint
venture partners or other third parties; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our
products; regulations on the repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the United States; highly inflationary
currency , devaluation or fluctuation, such as the devaluation of the Russian ruble, Venezuelan bolivar , Mexican peso, euro, Brazilian
real and the Canadia n dollar; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency
exchange restriction s, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or could significantly affect
our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and could result in the deconsolidation of such
businesses, such as the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015; the lack of
well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and United
States laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery
Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adver se consequences, such as the assessment of fines or
penalties, for any failure to comply with these laws and regulations. If we are unable to expand our businesses in developing and
emer ging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on
capital we expect from our investments in these markets, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely
affected.

Table of Contents
Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Many of the countries in which we operate have experienced and continue to experience unfavorable economic conditions. Our
business or financial results may be adversely impacted by these unfavorable economic conditions, including: adverse changes in
interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity markets, including speculative influences; highly inflationary currency ,
devaluation or fluctuation; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation or economic conditions; the
effects of governme nt initiatives, including austerity or stimulus measures, to manage economic conditions and any changes to or
cessation of such initiatives; the effects  of any default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of the countries in which our
products are sold or of countries that may then impact countries in which our products are sold; reduced demand for our products
resulting from volatility in general globa l economic conditions or a shift in consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise
to regional, local or private label products or other lower -cost products, or to less profitable channels; or a decrease in the fair value
of pension  or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or
post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our customers,
consumers, suppliers, bottlers, distribut ors, joint venture partners or other third parties and any negative impact on any of the
foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition , some of the major financia l institutions with which we execute transactions, including U.S. and non-U.S. commercial
banks, insurance companies, investment banks and other financial institutions, may be exposed to a ratings downgrade, bankruptcy ,
liquidity , default or similar risks as a result of unfavorable economic conditions, changing regulatory requirements or other factors
beyond our control. A ratings downgrade, bankruptcy , receivership, default or similar event involving a major financial institution,
or changes in the regulatory environm ent, may limit the ability or willingness of financial institutions to enter into financial
transactions with us, including to provide banking or related cash management services, or to extend credit on terms commercially
acceptable to us or at all; may leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or exposed to certain currencies or price risk associated
with forec asted purchases of raw mater ials; or may result in a decline in the market value of our investments in debt securities,
which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or
shortages of raw materials and other supplies.
We and our business partners use variou s raw materials and other supplies in our business. The principal ingredients we use in our
beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn
sweeteners, flavorings, flour , grapefruit and other fruits, oats, oranges, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar ,
vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials
include plastic resins, including PET and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack
foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperbo ard cartons. Fuel and natural gas are also important
commodities for our businesses due to their use in our facilities and the vehicles delivering our products.
Some of these raw materials and suppli es are sourced from countries experien cing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable
economic conditions , and some are available from a limited number of suppliers or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at
its peak. The raw materials and energy, including fuel, that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products
are largely commodities that are subject  to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes
in global
16
Table of Contents
supply and demand, weather condition s, disease or pests, agricultural uncertainty , health epidemics or pandemics, governmental
incentives and controls, political uncertainties, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Shortage of some of these raw
materials and other supplies, sustained interruption in their supply or an increase in their costs could adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operat ions. Many of our ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open
market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts
and purcha se orders, pricing agreements and derivatives. If commodity price changes result in unexpected or significant increases in
raw materials and energy costs, we may not be able to increase our product prices or effectively hedge against commodity price
increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. In addition,
certain of the deriv atives used to hedg e price risk do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and, therefore, can result in
increased volatility in our net earnings in any given period due to changes in the spot prices of the underlying commodities.
Water is also a limited resource in many parts of the world. The lack of availabl e water of acceptable quality and increasing pressure
to conserve water in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to: supply chain disruption, adverse effects on our operations, higher
compliance costs, capital expenditures (including additional investments in the development of technologies to enhance water
efficiency and reduce water consumption), higher production costs, the cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or
the facilities of our suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties, or damage to our reputation, any of
which could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Failure to realize anticipated benefits from our productivity initiatives or global operating model could have an adverse impact
on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our future success and earnings growt h depend in part on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. Our
productivity initiatives help support our growth initiatives and contribute to our results of operations. We continue to implement
strategic plans that we believe will position our business for future success and long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to
achieve a lower cost structure and operate more efficiently in the highly competitive beverage, food and snack categories and
markets. We are also continuing to implement our global operating model to improve efficiency , decision making, innovation and
brand management across the global PepsiCo organization to enable us to comp ete effectively . Further , in order to capitalize on our
cost reduction efforts and our global operating model, it will be necessary to make certain investments in our business, which may
be limited due to capital constraints. Some of these measures could yield unintended consequences, such as business disruptions,
distraction of management and emplo yees, reduced employee morale and productivity , and unexpected additional employee
attrition, including the inability to attract or retain key personnel. It is critical that we have the appropriate personnel in place to
continue to lead and execute our plans, including to effectively manage person nel adjustments and transitions resulting from these
initiatives and increased competition for employees with the skills necessary to implement our plans. If we are unable to
successfully implement our productivity initiatives and global operating model as planned, fail to implement these initiatives as
timely as we anticip ate, do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives or incur higher than expected or unanticipated
costs in implementing these initiatives, or fail to identify and implement additional productivity opportunities in the future, or fail to
successfully manage  business disruptions or unexpected employee consequences on our workforce, morale or productivity , we may
not realize all or any of the anticipate d benefits, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

Business disruptions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our ability , and that of our suppliers and other third parties, including our indepe ndent bottlers, contract manufacturers, joint venture
partners, independent distributors and customers, to make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products in our portfolio is
critical to our success. Damage or disrup tion to our or their operations due to any of the following factors could impair the ability to
make, manufacture, transport, distribute or sell products in our portfolio: adverse weather conditions or natural disaster , such as a
hurricane, earthquake or flooding; government action; economic or political uncertainties or instability in countries in which such
products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, which may also affect our ability to protect the security of our assets and
employees; fire; terrorism; outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; food safety warnings or recalls, whether related to products in
our portfolio or otherwise; health epidemics or pandemics; unplanned delays or unexpected problems associated with repairs or
enhancements of facilities in which such products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; cyber incidents; industrial accidents
or other occupational health and safety issues; telecommunications failures; power or water shortages; strikes and other labor
disputes; or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and other third parties. Failure to take adequate steps to
mitigate the likelihood or potential impa ct of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur , could adversely affect
our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our operations.
Product contamina tion or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality , safety and integrity could adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality , safety and integrity , including with
respect to raw mate rials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegations (whether or not valid) of product quality issues,
mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, allergens or contamination may reduce demand for products in our portfolio, cause production
and delivery disruptions or increase costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If
any of the products in our portfolio are mislabeled or become unfit for consumption or cause injury , illness or death, or if appropriate
resources are not devoted to product quality and safety (particularly as we expand our portfolio into new categories) or to comply
with chang ing food safety requirements, products in our portfolio may be subje ct to a product recall and/or be subject to liability or
government action, which could result in payment of damages or fines, cause certain products in our portfolio to be unavailable for a
period of time or result in adverse publicity, which could reduce consumer demand and brand equity . Our business could also be
adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality , safety and integrity generally , even if such loss of confidence is
unrelated to products in our portfolio. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations. In addition, if we do not have adequate insurance, if we do not have contractual indemnification from suppliers, bottlers,
distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or if indemnification is not available, the liability relating to such product
claims or disruption as a result of recall efforts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are a leading global beverage, food and snack company with brands that are respected household names throughout the world.
Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded product s. Our reputation or brand image could be adversely
impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical,
social and environm ental practices for all of our operations and activities, including with respect to human rights and workplace
safety , or failure

Table of Contents
to require our supp liers or other third parties to do so; the failure to achiev e our goals of reducing sodium, added sugars and
saturated fat in certa in products and of growing our portfolio of product choices ; the failure to achieve our other sustainability goals
or to be perceived as appropriately addressing matters of social responsibility; health concerns (whether or not valid) about our
products or particular ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, our products,  including concerns regarding whether certain of our
products contribute to obesity; the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes, labeling requirements or other
limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale, display or advertising of our products ; any failure to comply , or perception of a failure to
comply , with our policies and goals, including those regarding advertising to children and reducing calorie consumption from sugar -
sweetened beverages; our research and development efforts; our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials,
packaging, water , energy use and waste management or any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the
environment; the practices of our employees, agents, customers, distributors, suppliers, bottlers, joint venture partners or other third
parties with respect to any of the foreg oing, actual or perceived; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns or marketing
programs; consumer perception of our use of social media; or our responses to any of the foregoing or negative publicity as a result
of any of the foregoing.
In addition , we operate globally , which requires us to comply with numerous local regulations, including, without limitation, anti-
corruption laws, competition laws and tax laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured,
distributed or sold. In the event that our employees engage in improper activities, we may be subject to enforcement actions,
litigation, loss of sales or other conseque nces, which may cause us to suffer damage to our reputation in the United States or abroad.
Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and
timely financial information could also hurt our reputation. In addition, water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and
demand for water continues to rise. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not
to act, responsibly with respect to water use.
Further , the popularity of social media and other consumer -oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of
information dissemination. As a result, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us, our products, policies, practices or
advertising campaig ns and marketing programs, our use of social media or of posts or other information disseminated by us or our
employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties, consumer perception of
any of the foregoing , or failure by us to respond effectively to any of the forego ing, may also generate adverse publicity (whether or
not valid) that could damage our reputation.
Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could
result in decreased demand for our products and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as
well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.
Failure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations, or to complete or
manage divestitures or refranchisings, could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We regula rly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, refranchisings and
other strategic transa ctions. Potential issues associated with these activities could include, among other things: our ability to realize
the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or syner gies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time
frame, or at all; receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction; and diversion of
management’ s attention from day-to-day operations.
With respect to acqu isitions, the following factors also pose potential risks: our ability to successfully combine our businesses with
the business of the acquired company , including integrating the acquired company’ s
19
Table of Contents
manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology
systems with our company; our ability to successfully operate in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining
executives and key employees; conform ing standards, controls (including internal control over financial reporting, environmental
compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with other regulations), procedures and policies, business cultures and
compensation structures between us and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining corporate and administrative
infrastructures and avoiding increased operating expenses; consolidating sales and marketing operations; retaining existing
customers and attracting new custom ers; identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;
coordinating geogra phically dispersed organizations; managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations
following completion of an acquisition; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation.
With respect to joint ventures, we share ownership and management responsib ility with one or more parties who may or may not
have the same goals, strategies, prioritie s or resources as we do. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-
owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners may
adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us or otherwise damage our reputation
and brands and adve rsely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, acquisitions and joint ventures
outside of the United States increase our exposure to risks associated with operations outside of the United States, including
fluctuations in exchange rates and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery
laws, and laws and regulations outside the United States.
With respect to divestitures and refranchisings, we may not be able to complete  such transactions on terms commercially favorable
to us or at all and may fail to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestiture or refranchising. Further , as
divestitures and refranchisings may reduce our direct control over certain aspects of our business, any failure to maintain good
relations with divested or refranchised  businesses in our supply or sales chain may adversely impact our sales or business
performance.
If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations, or if a divestiture or
refranchising is not successfully comple ted or managed or does not result in the benefits or cost savings we expect, our business,
financial condition or results of operations may be adversely af fected.
A change  in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in an
impairment charge, which could materially af fect our results of operations.
We conduct impairment tests on vario us components of our portfolio annually , during our third quarter , or more frequently , if
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that an other -than-temporary impairment exists. Any
changes in our estimates or underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our divisions or in determining the fair
value of any such division, including goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived
assets, could adversely affect our result s of operations. Factors that could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to:
significant negative economic or industr y trends or competitive operating condi tions, significant changes in the nature and timing of
decisions regarding assets or markets that do not perform consistent with our expectations, including factors we use to estimate
future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in
the periods recognized.

If we are unable to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce, it could have a negative impact
on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our conti nued grow th requires us to recruit, hire, retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse
workforce. We compete to recruit and hire new employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Our
employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends
on our ability to retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Any unplanned turnover or
our failure to develop an adequate succession plan to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or
to hire and retain a diverse workforce could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage or result
in increase d costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employe e turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any
of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The loss of any key customer or changes to the retail landscape could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results
of operations.
Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores,
discount/dollar store s, mass merchandisers, membership stores, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among
others. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Wal-Mart, to compete effectively . The
loss of any of our key customers could adversely affect our business, financia l condition or results of operations. In addition, our
industry has been affected by changes to the retail landscape, including increas ed consolidation of retail ownership, particularly in
North America and Europe, resulting in large retailers with increased purchasing  power , which may impact our ability to compete in
these areas. Such retailers may demand  improved efficiency , lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Further , should
larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks, other distribution channels such as e-commerce, or private
label brands, or if we are unable to develop successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers, the competitive
advantages we derive from our go-to-market systems and brand equity may be eroded. Failure to appropriately respond to any such
actions, to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our custom ers or to adapt to the rapidly changing retail and e-
commerce landscapes could reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space and product availability at our retailers, adversely
affect our ability to maintain or grow our share of sales or volume, and adversely  affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations. In addition, if we are unable  to resolve a dispute with any of our key customers, or if there is a change in the business
condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, our business, financial condition or results of
operations may be adversely af fected.
Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade
of our credit ratings.
We expect to mainta in Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready
access to global credit markets at favora ble interest rates. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency , especially
any downg rade to below investment grade, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase
our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at
all. Furthe r, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market
with the same flexib ility that we have experienced historically , and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive
types of debt financ ing. Our borrowing costs and access to the commercial pape r market could also be adversely affected if a credit
rating agen cy announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An increase in our borrowing costs, limitations
on our ability to access the global
21

capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity could adversely af fect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information systems against, or effectively respond to,
cyberattacks or other cyber incidents or if our information systems, or those of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors,
joint venture partners or other third parties, are otherwise disrupted.
We depend on information technology , including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our
business, including: to interface with our customers and consumers; to engage in digital marketing activities; to enable and improve
the effectiveness of our operations; to order and manage materials from supplie rs; to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency; to
comply with regulatory , financial reporting, legal and tax requirements; to collect and store sensitive data and confidential
information; to communicate electronically among our global operations and with our employees and the employees of our
independent bottlers , contract manufacturers, distributors, joint ventures, suppli ers and other third parties; and to communicate with
our investors, customers and consumers. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Attempted
cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently , are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more
sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including criminal hackers, hacktivists
and state-s ponsored institutions) and expertise. To date, no cyberattack or other cyber incident has had a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to
build and maintain our information technology infrastructure, including monitoring networks and systems, upgrading our security
policies and the skills and training of our employees, and requiring our third-party service providers, customers, suppliers, bottlers,
distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties to do the same, if we or they fail to timely identify or appropriately respond
to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, or if our information systems are damaged, compromised, destroyed or shut down (whether
as a result of natur al disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events, network outages, software,
equipment or telecommunications failures, technology development defects, user errors, or from deliberate cyberattacks such as
malicious or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering, hackers or otherwise), our business could be
disrupted and we could, among other things, be subject to: transaction errors; processing inefficiencies; the loss of, or failure to
attract new, customers and consumers;  the loss of revenues from unauthorized use, acquisition or disclosure of, or access to,
confidential information; the loss of, or damage to, intellectual property or trade secrets, including the loss or unauthorized
disclosure of sensitive data or other assets; damage to our reputation; litigatio n; regulatory enforcement actions; violation of data
privacy , security or other laws and regulations; and remediation costs. Further , our information systems and the information stored
therein could be compromised by, and we could experience similar adverse consequences due to, unauthorized outside parties’ intent
on accessing or extracting sensitive data or confidential information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes (or
demonstrating an ability to do so) or by inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, agents or third parties. Similar risks
exist with respect to the third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and
administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting
functions, and systems managed, hoste d, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors. While we currently maintain
insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address certain aspects of cyber incidents, network
failures and data privacy-related concerns, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances
surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or
brands that may result from an incident.

If we are not able to successfully imple ment shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively ,
our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted.
We have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to share certain information technology support services and
administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting
functions, and may enter into agreements for shared services in other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies.
In addition, we utiliz e cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors to process, transmit and store
information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees, customers, consumers and other third
parties. If any of these third-party service providers or vendors do not perform effectively , or if we fail to adequately monitor their
performance, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings or we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors
made by such servic e providers and our reputation could be harmed. Depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead
to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security
breaches or otherwise, effects on financial reporting, litigation or remediation costs, or damage to our reputation, which could have a
negative impact on employee morale.
We continue on our multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial
processing systems,  to enterprise-wide systems solutions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to
build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative,
it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently , and remain in step with the changing needs of the trade,
which could result in the loss of custo mers or consumers. In addition, the failure to either deliver the applications on time, or
anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to business disruption and loss of customers or consumers and
revenue.
Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar . Because our
consolidated financi al statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States,
where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar , are translated into U.S. dollars. Our operations outside of the United
States, particularly in Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Brazil, generate a significant portion of our net revenue. In
addition, we purcha se many of the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous markets and in
numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of currency controls or other currency exchange
restrictions, have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Climate change or water scarcity , or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change or water scarcity , may
negatively af fect our business and operations or damage our reputation.
There is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global
temperatures, weath er patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such
climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity , we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable
pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, potatoes and various
fruits. As demand for water access continues to increase around the world, we may be subject to decreased availability of water ,
deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water , which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution
operations. The effects of climate chang e may also exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water . In addition,
natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain.
23
Table of Contents
The increasing concern over climate change may result in new or increased regional, federal and/or global legal and regulatory
requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use
due to local water scarcity concerns. In the event that such regulation is more  stringent than current regulatory obligations or the
measures that we are currently under taking to monitor and improve our energy efficiency and water conservation, we may
experience disruptio ns in, or significant increases in our costs of, operation and delivery and we may be required to make additional
investments in facilities and equipment.  In particular , increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the cost of
energy, including fuel, required to operate our facilities or transport and distribu te our products, thereby substantially increasing the
distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, the effects of climate change or water scarcity could
negatively af fect our business and operations.
In addition, any perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory
requirements concerning climate change or water scarcity could result in adverse publicity and could adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations.
There is also increased public focus,  including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, on these and other
environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation and land use. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our
industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment.
A portion of our workforce belongs to unions. Failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or strikes or
work stoppages, could cause our business to suf fer.
Many of our employ ees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collective
bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interrupt ions could occur if we are unable to renew these
agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms, which could impair manufacturing and
distribution of our products or result in a loss of sales, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of
operations. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs
or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing
business needs or strategy .
If we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if we are found to infringe the intellectual property
rights of others, the value of our products or brands could be reduced, which could have an adverse impact on our business,
financial condition or results of operations.
We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business. These intellectual property rights include ingredient
formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets that are important to our business and relate to a
variety of our products, their packaging , the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used
in our businesses. We protect our intell ectual property rights globally through a combination of trademark, copyright, patent and
trade secret laws, third-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of third-party misuses of our intellectual
property . If we fail to obtain or adequately protect our ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and
other trade  secrets, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property , the
value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or
results of operations. In addition, if, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we are
found to have infrin ged the intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly , such finding could have an adverse impact on
our business, financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality
of existing products.

Table of Contents
Potential liabilities and costs from litigation or legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.
We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including but not
limited to litigation related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients, intellectual
property rights and environmental, employment and insurance matters. We evaluate legal claims to assess the likelihood of
unfavorable outcom es and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses and establish reserves as appropriate. Litigation is
inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in litigation, or that our assessment
of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the
ultimate outcome of such litigation. In the event that management’ s assessment of claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or
litigation that is material arises in the future, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations. Defending ourselves from claims, including non-meritorious claims, may also require us to incur significant expense and
devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that may damage our reputation or brand image, which could have
an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Many factors may adversely af fect the price of our common stock.
Many factors may adversely af fect the price of our common stock. Such factors, some of which are beyond our control, may include,
but are not limited to: unfavorable economic conditions; changes in financial or tax reporting and changes in accounting principles
or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results; investor perceptions of our business, strategies and
performance or those of our competitors; actions by shareholders or others seeking to influence our business strategies; speculation
by the media or investment community regarding our business, strategies and performance or those of our competitors; trading
activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock; changes in our credit
ratings; and the impact of our share repurchase programs or dividend policy . In addition, corporate actions, such as those we may or
may not take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure and our strategy , including as a result of
business, legal, regulatory and tax considerations, may not have the impact we intend and may adversely affect the price of our
common stock. The above factors, as well as other risks included in this “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” could adversely affect the price of
our common stock.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports  from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days
or more preceding the end of our 2015  fiscal year and that remain unresolved.

Item 3. Legal Pr oceedings.
As previously disclosed, in January 2011, Wojewodzka Inspekcja Ochrony Srodowiska, the Polish environmental control authority ,
began an audit of a bottling plant of our subsidiary , Pepsi-Cola General Bottler s Poland SP, z.o.o. (PCGB), in Michrow , Poland. In
July 2013, Wojewodzka Inspekcja Ochrony Srodowiska alleged that the plant was not in compliance in 2009 with applicable
regulations governing the taking of water samples for analysis of the plant’ s waste and sought monetary sanctions of $650,000 and,
in August 2013, PCGB appealed this decision. In April 2015, the General Environmental Inspector for Environmental Protection
upheld the sanctions against PCGB and, in May 2015, PCGB further appealed this decision. In October 2015, Viovodeship
Administrative Court in Warsaw rejected our appeal and, in December 2015, PCGB filed an extraordinary appeal in the Supreme
Administrative Court.
Also as previously disclosed, in May 2011 and August 2012, Kozep-Duna-V olgyi Kornyezetvedelmi, Termeszetvedelmi es Vizugyi
Felugyeloseg (Buda pest), the regional Hungarian governmental authority (the Hungarian Authority), notified our subsidiary ,
Fovarosi Asvanyviz-es Uditoipari Zrt. (FAU), that it assessed monetary sanctions of approximately $220,000 for alleged violation of
applicable wastewater dischar ge standards in 2010 and of approximately $153,000 for alleged violation of applicable wastewater
dischar ge standards in 2011, respectively . Following an appeal of this decision by FAU, the Orszagos Kornyezetvedelmi,
Termeszetvedelmi es Vizugyi Felugyeloseg (Budapest) increased the 2011 sanctions to $320,000 and the 2012 sanctions to
$196,000, on the grounds that certain pollutant factors had not been taken into account by the Hungarian Authority . In the third
quarter of 2015, these sanctions were annulled by the Fovarosi Kozigazgatasi es Munkaugyi Birosag (Budapest).
In addition, we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal, administrat ive, regulatory and government proceedings, claims
and inquir ies arising in the normal course of business. While the results of these proceedings, claims and inquiries cannot be
predicted with certainty , management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial statements, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Environment and
Environmental Com pliance.” and, under “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Changes in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations

OUR BUSINESS
Executive Overview
We are a leading global food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of enjoyable brands, including Frito-Lay ,
Gatorade, Pepsi-Col a, Quaker and Tropicana. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third
parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient and enjoyable beverages, foods and snacks, serving
customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.
Our management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our busine ss results and financial condition. These indicators
include growth in volume, revenue, organic revenue, operating profit (as reported and excluding certain items and the impact of
foreign exchange translation), EPS (as reported and excluding certain items and the impact of foreign exchange translation), retail
sales, market share,  safety , innovation, product and service quality , organiza tional health, brand equity , media viewership and
engagement, employee diversity , net commodity inflation, productivity savings, net capital spending, free cash flow and free cash
flow excluding certain items, cash returned to shareholders in the forms of share repurchases and dividends, advertising and
marketing expenses, research and development expenditures, ROIC and net ROIC (excluding certain items), and gross and operating
margins (as reported and excluding certain items).
During 2015 , we continued to take steps to position  ourselves for sustainable value creation  over the long term and continued our
progress against certain key busines s priorities – brand building and innovation, productivity , portfolio and capability
transformation, talent management and disciplined capital allocation. For example:
•In 2015, PepsiCo was the leading contr ibutor to food and beverage retail sales in the United States in measured channels,
according to Information Resources, Inc.
•Since 2012, we have increased spendin g as a percent of net revenue on both advertising and marketing and research and
development, illustrating our ability to manage costs and margins in the short run while reinvesting in our business to drive
growth over the long term.
•In 2015, excluding items affecting comparability , we achieved a net ROIC of 19.6%, reflecting our focus on disciplined
capital allocation. For further information on this non-GAAP measure, please see “Net Return on Invested Capital.”
•PepsiCo increased its annualized divide nd for the 43rd consecutive year in 2015 and returned $9 billion to our shareholders
through share repurchases and dividends. Since 2012, we have delivered $24 billion back to shareholders in the form of
dividends and share repurchases.
At PepsiCo, we believe delivering strong performance and acting with a sense of purpose are intertwined – we call this approach
Performance with Purpose and it is embedded into our business. Performance with Purpose is focused on three priorities: human
sustainability (impro ving the nutritional profile of many of our products while  offering more choices to meet changing consumer
needs), environmental sustainability (reducing our environmental impact while lowering our operating costs), and talent
sustainability (continuing
40
Table of Contents
to develop a diverse and engaged workforce).
As we look to 2016  and beyond, we believe our Performance with Purpose strategy will enable us to continue delivering strong
financial results while positioning our Company for long-term sustainable growth. Our business strategies are designed to address
key challenges facing our Company , including: uncertain and volatile macroeconomic conditions, including unfavorable exchange
rate fluctuations and currency restrictions; geopolitical, economic and social instability; an increasingly competitive business
environment with constantly changing consumer tastes and preferences, including continued consumer focus on nutritious products
and changes in methods of distribution and payment; resource scarcity; and intensifying regulatory pressures, including changes in
tax laws and the imposition of labeling requirements in markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold.
See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. We believe that
many of these challe nges also create new growth opportunities for our Company . We anticipate that the challenges we currently face
will contin ue and we intend to focus on the following areas to address and adapt to these challenges and to capitalize on these
opportunities:
Upgrading our commercial capabilities.
Continued growth of our business remains critical to our success and we remain focused on innovation and brand building to
position ourselves to continue to deliver the types of products our consumers demand and address increasing regulation of our
products, including changes in tax laws and the imposition of labeling requirements. Consumer demand continues to shift towards
more nutri tious products and we are accelerating our efforts to meet this demand  by reducing sodium, added sugars and saturated fat
in many of our products while continuing to invest in growing our nutrition businesses. We are also focused on developing new
ways to reach our consumers through innovative digital marketing, social media  engagement and content creation. In addition, as the
global economic, social and political landscape remains volatile, with many markets in which our products are made, manufactured,
distributed or sold experiencing unstable conditions, we intend to address these  challenges by continuing to build a portfolio that is
balanced across categories and geographies to navigate short-term volatility and uncertainty .
Building new capabilities.
With consumer tastes and preferences continuing to evolve, we must continue to build new capabilities to meet the demands of our
customers and consumers. To that end, we are focused on increasing our e-commerce presence and capabilities, continuing to invest
in research and development and design to foster breakthrough innovations and to enhance consumer experiences across our
businesses, and increasing our foodservice presence through new culinary , equipment, product and marketing innovations.
Increasing our focus on reducing costs.
We intend to continu e our focus on productivity and lowering the cost base of the Company , primarily by utilizing our global scale,
eliminating duplicat ion, deploying new technologies and capitalizing on everyday opportunities to lower our cost base. In 2014, we
announced a goal of delivering $5 billio n in savings over five years from 2015-2 019, and we are on track to do so. We have doubled
productivity since 2011, delivering approximately $3 billion in savings from 2013-2015, and over $1 billion in savings in 2015
alone. To build on this progress, we continue to identify new opportunities to cut costs, innovating our way to a more productive
future. W e are automating our processes for packaging and warehousing. W e are making products for one market on production lines
in another , lifting utilization rates and better integrating our global supply chain. We are enabling engineers to monitor our
production systems remotely , resulting in better , faster solutions at a lower cost. We are also instituting policies that we call “Smart
Spending” to control expenses and are expanding training to minimize waste and boost ef ficiency .

Fostering a culture of collaboration.
PepsiCo has a histor y of developing strong leaders and we expect the global competition for talent to continue to intensify . To meet
the future needs of our business, we remain focused on building the next generation of capabilities and talent, including building a
workforce that reflects the diversity of the consumers we serve and developin g the functional, technical and leadership skills we
need for long-term sustainable performance.
Exercising discipline with respect to capital returns.
We believ e that disciplined, balanced capital allocation is one of the hallmarks of a well-run business. We are focused on reinvesting
in our business, continuing to pay dividends to shareholders, strengthening our market positions through acquisitions, and returning
residual cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Over the past ten years, we have returned approximately $35 billion to
shareholders in the form of share repurchases – and more than $65 billion including dividends.

Our Business Risks
We are subject to risks in the normal course of business. During 2015  and 2014 , certain countries in which our products are sold
operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, debt and credit
issues, and currency fluctuations. W e continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely
and have identified actions to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, on our future results. See also  “Item 1A. Risk
Factors”, “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks and the actions we have
taken to address key challenges.
Risk Management Framework
The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks. To identify , assess, prioritize, address, manage,
monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’ s operations, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This
framework includes the following:
•PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’ s integrated risk management framework. One of the
Board’ s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the
Company’ s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’ s top risks. The Board receives updates
on key risks through out the year. In addition, the Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of
certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters.
◦The Audi t Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’ s risk
management and oversight processes, and assists with the Board’ s oversight of financial, compliance and employee
safety risks facing PepsiCo; and
◦The Compensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’ s employee compensation policies and practices to
assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior .
•The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC), which is comprised of a cross-functional,  geographically diverse, senior management
group, including PepsiCo’ s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, meets regularly to identify , assess,
prioritize and address our top strategic, financial, operating, business, compliance, safety , reputational and other risks. The
PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation ef forts to the Board;
•Division and key country risk commit tees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams meet regularly to
identify , assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks;
•PepsiCo’ s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools
and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks
and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors and the Audit
Committee of the Board;
•PepsiCo’ s Corporate  Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic
audit and review procedures; and
•PepsiCo’ s Compliance & Ethics Department leads and coordinates our compliance policies and practices.

Market Risks
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of
strategies, including  productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging with derivative instruments. Ongoing
productivity initiati ves involve the identification and effective implementa tion of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or
efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and
pricing agreements. See “Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.” and “Our busines s, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs,
disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies.” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” See Note 9 to our consolidated
financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable purchasing commitments.
The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market
fluctuations is discussed below . See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and
our hedging policies. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical plan
assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.
Inflationary , deflatio nary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our
products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.
Commodity Prices
Our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of $1.0 billion  as of December 26, 2015  and $1.2 billion  as of
December 27, 2014 . At the end of 2015 , the poten tial change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assum ing a 10%
decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2015  by $85 million .
Foreign Exchange
Our opera tions outside of the U.S. generated 44% of our net revenue in 2015, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdo m
and Brazil comprising approximately 20% of our net revenue in 2015 . As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the
international markets in which our produ cts are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. During 2015 , unfavorable foreign exchange
reduced net revenue growth by 10 percentage points, primarily due to the Russian ruble, Venezuelan bolivar , Mexican peso, euro,
Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar . Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our
future financial results.
In addition, unstable economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made,
manufactured, distri buted or sold, including in Russia, Ukraine, Brazil, Greece  and the Middle East, and currency fluctuations in
certain of these international markets continue to result in challenging operating environments.
Starting in 2014 , Russia announced economic sanctions against the United States and other nations that include a ban on imports of
certain ingredients and finished goods from specific countries. We do not anticipate the current sanctions to have a material impact
on the results of our operations in Russia or our consolidated
44
Table of Contents
results or financial position, and we will continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in Russia closely .
For the years ended December 26, 2015  and December 27, 2014 , total net revenue generated by our operations in Russia represented
4% and 7% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively . As of December 26, 2015 , our long-lived assets in Russia were $3.6
billion. Our operations in Ukraine are not significant in relation to our consolidated results or financial position.
Our foreig n currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.1 billion  as of December 26, 2015  and $2.7 billion  as of
December 27, 2014 . At the end of 2015 , we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have
decreased our net unrealized gains by $118 million .
Evolving conditions  in Venezuela, including increasingly restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to dollars
through official currency exchange markets, resulted in an other -than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan
bolivar and the U.S. dollar , which significantly impacted our ability to effectively manage our Venezuelan businesses, including
restrictions on the ability of our Venezuelan businesses to import certain raw materials to maintain normal production and to settle
U.S. dolla r-denominated obligations. The exchange restrictions, combined with other regulations that have limited our ability to
import certain raw materials, also increasingly constrained our ability to make and execute operational decisions regarding our
businesses in Venezuela. In addition, the inability of our Venezuelan businesses to pay dividends, which remain subject to
Venezuelan government approvals, restricted our ability to realize the earnings generated out of our Venezuelan businesses. We
expect these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future.
As a result of these factors, we concluded that, effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, we did not meet the accounting
criteria for control over our wholly-own ed Venezuelan subsidiaries, and therefore we deconsolidated our wholly-owned Venezuelan
subsidiaries effectiv e as of the end of the third quarter of 2015. We also conclud ed that, effective as of the end of the third quarter of
2015, due to the above-mentioned factors and other matters impacting the operation of our beverage joint venture with our franchise
bottler in Venezuela and the distribution  of its products, we no longer had significant influence over our joint venture, which was
previously accounted for under the equity method. As a result of these conclusions, effective at the end of the third quarter of 2015,
we began accountin g for our investments in our wholly-owned Venezuelan subsidiaries and our joint venture using the cost method
of accounting and recorded pre- and after-tax charges of $1.4 billion in our Cons olidated Statement of Income to reduce the value of
the cost method investments to their estimated fair values, resulting in a full impairment. The impairment charges primarily included
approximately $1.2 billion related to our investments in previously consolidated Venezuelan subsidiaries and our joint venture, and
$111 million related to the reclassificati on of cumulative translation losses. The factors that led to the above-mentioned conclusions
at the end of the third quarter of 2015 continued to exist as of the end of 2015. For further information, please refer to Note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements and “Items Af fecting Comparability .”
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we no longer included the results of our Venezuelan businesses in our Consolidated
Statement of Income and our financial results only included revenue relating to the sales of inventory to our Venezuelan entities to
the extent cash was received for those sales. Any dividends from our Venezuelan entities will be recorded as income upon receipt of
the cash. We did not receive any U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter of 2015 from our Venezuelan entities. Our ongoing contractual
commitments to our Venezuelan businesses are not material. In 2015, the results of our operations in Venezuela, which include the
months of January through August, gene rated 2% of our net revenue and 2% of our operating profit, prior to the impairment charges
of $1.4 billion.
45
Table of Contents
Inter est Rates
Our interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 26, 2015  and December 27, 2014  had a total notional value of
$12.5 billion  and $9.3 billion , respectively . Assuming year-end 2015  investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point
increase in interest rates would have decreased net interest expense by $8 million  in 2015  due to higher cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments levels as compared with our variable rate debt.
OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
An apprec iation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require
management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, and as a result, such estimates may significantly
impact our financial results. The precisio n of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying
variables and a range of possible outcom es. Other than our accounting for pension and retiree medical plans, our critical accounting
policies do not involve a choice betw een alternative methods of accounting. We applied our critical accounting policies and
estimation methods consistently in all material respects, and for all periods presented, and have discussed these policies with our
Audit Committee.
Our critical accounting policies are:
•revenue recognition;
•goodwill and other intangible assets;
•income tax expense and accruals; and
•pension and retiree medical plans.
Revenue Recognition
Our produ cts are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the U.S., and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally , and
may allow discounts for early payment.  We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales
terms that do not allow for a right of return. However , our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace
damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect.
Similarly , our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. Based on our
experience with this practice, we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.
Our policy  is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to
regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with
customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For produ ct delivered through other distribution networks, we
monitor customer inventory levels.
As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business”, we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to
customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing
activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers
for performing merchandising activities  on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new
products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices . Sales incentives and discounts also include support
provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities. A number of our sales incentives,
such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates,
46
Table of Contents
are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout. These accruals are based on
contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating
customer participation and performanc e levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally
insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and
marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. The terms of most of our incentive
arrangements do not exceed a year, and therefore do not require highly uncertain  long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as
fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Costs incurred to obtain these rights are recognized over the shorter of the
economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $321 million  as of December 26,
2015  and $355 million  as of December 27, 2014  are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our
balance sheet.
For interim  reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our
interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted
sales incen tives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’ s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our
forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes
in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In
addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing
activities. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our total marketplace spending. Our
annual financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology .
We estima te and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility , the aging of
accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data. Bad debt expense is classified within selling, general and administrative
expenses in our income statement.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as
incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first
assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any
excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a
number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future
expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
We believ e that a brand has an indefinit e life if it has a history of strong revenu e and cash flow performance and we have the intent
and ability  to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these perpetual brand criteria are not met,
brands are amortized over their expected  useful lives, which generally range from five to 40 years. Determining the expected life of
a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer
awareness, brand history , future expans ion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of
the countries in which the brand is sold.
In connect ion with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to
manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In deter mining the useful life of these franchise rights, many
factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these
franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these
franchise rights to us,
47
Table of Contents
including legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are
considered as indefinite-lived, with the balance amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right
was granted.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually , using either a
qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter . Where we use the qualitative
assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered
include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and
significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an
impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
The quantitative assessment requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with
management’ s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions
underlying a discount rate (weighted-av erage cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management
judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroec onomic and other factors to estimate future levels of
sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for nonamortizable intangible assets, such
as forecas ted growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are
consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks
described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks.”
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on performing the quantitative assessment.
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated
fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the fiscal years ended December 26, 2015 , December 27, 2014
and December 28, 2013 . In 2015, we perfo rmed the impairment analysis for goodwill for certain of our reporting units and for
certain of our indefi nite-lived intangible  assets using the qualitative approach and concluded that it was more likely than not that the
estimated fair values of our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets were greater than their carrying amounts. After
reaching this conclusion, no further testing was performed.
We recognized no material impairment charges for nonamortizable intangible assets in each of the fiscal years ended December 26,
2015 , December 27, 2014  and December 28, 2013 . In 2014, we recogn ized pre-tax impairment charges in ESSA for nonamortizable
intangible assets of $23 million. As of December 26, 2015, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired
franchise rights recorded at NAB exceeded their carrying values. However , there could be an impairment of the carrying value of
NAB’ s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of NAB’ s CSD
business do not achieve our expected estimated future cash flows or if macroec onomic conditions result in a future increase in the
weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the recent economic and political
developments in Russia on the estimate d fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia and have concluded that there
is no impairment as of December 26, 2015. However , a further deterioration in these conditions in Russia could potentially require
us to record an impairment char ge for these assets in the future.

Income T ax Expense and Accruals
Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various
jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax
positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain
positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light
of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. See “Imposition of new taxes, disagreements with tax
authorities or additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.” in “Item 1A.
Risk Factors.”
An estima ted annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item
recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time
as that item. W e consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be among such items.
Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As
a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate).
Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deduct ible in our tax return, and some differences reverse
over time,  such as depreciation expense . These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets
generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already
recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax
liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense
for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements.
In 2015 , our annu al tax rate was 26.1%  compared to 25.1%  in 2014 , as discussed in “Other Consolidated Results.” The tax rate
increased 1.0 percentage point compared to the prior  year reflecting the impact of the Venezuela impairment charges, which had no
accompanying tax benefit, partially offset by the favorable resolution with the IRS of substantially all open matters related to the
audits for taxable years 2010 and 201 1.
Pension and Retir ee Medical Plans
Our pension plans cover certain full-time employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are
determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of servic e and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are
also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally , our share
of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based  upon years of service, with retirees contributing the
remainder of the cost. In addition, the Company has been phasing out certain Company subsidies of retiree medical benefits.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company offered certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit
pension plans the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’ s pension benefit
(payable in cash or rolled over into a qualified retirement plan or Individual Retirement Account (IRA)). As a result, we recorded a
pension lump sum settlement charge in corporate unallocated expenses of $141 million  ($88 million  after-tax or $0.06  per share).
See “Items Af fecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents
Our Assumptions
The determ ination of pension and retiree  medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of
benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical
expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the
year (serv ice cost), (2) the increase in the liability due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as
discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans.
Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:
•the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate);
•certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover , retirement age and mortality;
•the expected return on assets in our funded plans;
•for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and
•for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates.
Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’ s best judgment regarding future expectations. Due to the
significant management judgment invol ved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and
retiree medical expenses and obligations.
At each measureme nt date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality , long-term corporate debt securities with
maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the
discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount
of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.
We review our empl oyee demographic assumptions annually and update the assumptions as necessary . During 2014, we revised our
mortality assumptions to include the impact of the new set of mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries, adjusted to reflect
our experience and future expectations . This resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligation of our U.S. pension and
retiree medical programs. We also reviewed and revised other demographic assumptions to reflect recent experience. The net effect
of these changes and certain plan desig n changes resulted in an increase of approximately $150 million in the projected benefit
obligation at December 27, 2014.
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial  statements for information about the expected return on plan assets and our plan investment
strategy .
The health  care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plan’ s liability and expense is reviewed annually . Our review is
based on our claim s experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care
industry . Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes in
medical carriers.

Table of Contents
Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows:  
 2016  2015  2014
Pension      
Expense discount rate 4.4% 4.1% 5.0%
Expected rate of return on plan assets 7.2% 7.3% 7.3%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.2% 3.5% 3.7%
Retiree medical      
Expense discount rate 4.2% 3.8% 4.3%
Expected rate of return on plan assets 7.5% 7.5% 7.5%
Current health care cost trend rate 6.0% 6.2% 6.4%
Based on our assumptions, we expect our pension and retiree medical expenses to decrease in 2016 primarily driven by higher
discount rates and updates to demographic assumptions, partially of fset by the amortization of higher losses on plan assets.
Sensitivity of Assumptions
A decreas e in the discount rate or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. A 25-
basis-point decrease in the discount rate and expected rate of return assump tions would increase the 2016  pension and retiree
medical expense as follows:
Assumption  Amount
Discount rate  $47
Expected rate of return  $36
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the sensitivity of our retiree medical cost
assumptions.
Funding
We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in
accordance with applicable tax regulatio ns that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee
only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally , we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax
deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-
as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.
Our pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a resul t of many factors, such as changes in interest rates,
deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. See Note 7 to our consolidated
financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.

Mark-to-Market Net Impact
We centrally manage commodity deriva tives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products,
energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge account ing treatment are marked to market each period with
the resultin g gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative
expenses, depending  on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the
divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of
the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.
In 2015 , we recognized $11 million  ($8 million  after-tax with a nominal amount per share) of mark-to-market net gains on
commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses, with an $18 million  net loss recognized in cost of sales and a $29 million  net
gain recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses.
In 2014 , we recog nized $68 million  ($44 million  after-tax or $0.03 per share)  of mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges in
corporate unallocate d expenses, with a $33 million  net gain recognized in cost of sales and a $101 million  net loss recognized in
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges
2014 Multi-Y ear Pr oductivity Plan
In 2015 , 2014  and 2013, we incurred restructuring charges of $169 million  ($134 million  after-tax or $0.09 per share), $357 million
($262 million  after-tax or $0.17 per share) and $53 million  ($39 million  after-tax or $0.02 per share ), respecti vely, in conjunction
with our 2014 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan (2014 Productivity Plan). See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further
information.
We expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $990 million , of which approximately $705 million  represents cash
expenditures related to the 2014 Productivity Plan, summarized by period as follows:

(a)This total pre-tax charge will consist of approximately $525 million of severance and other employee-related costs, approximately $120 million for asset
impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and approximately $345 million for other costs associated with the
implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs. This charge is expected to impact reportable segments approximately as follows:
FLNA 12%, QFNA 2%, NAB 35%, Latin America 15%, ESSA 25%, AMENA 4% and Corporate 7%.
(b)In 2015 and 2014, cash expenditures include $2 million and $10 million, respectively, reported on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in pension
and retiree medical plan contributions.
2012 Multi-Y ear Pr oductivity Plan
In 2015 , 2014  and 2013 , we incur red restru cturing charges of $61 million  ($50 million  after-tax or $0.03 per share), $61 million
($54 million  after-tax or $0.04 per share ) and $110 million ($90 million after-tax or $0.06 per share), respectively , in conjunction

Pension-Related Settlements
In 2015, we recorde d pre-tax gains of $67 million ($42 million after-tax or $0.03 per share) in the NAB segment associated with the
settlement of pension-related liabilities from previous acquisitions.  These gains were recognized in selling, general and
administrative expenses.
In 2014, we recorded a pension lump sum settlement charge in corporate unalloc ated expenses of $141 million  ($88 million  after-tax
or $0.06  per share) related to payments for pension liabilities to certain former employees who had vested benefits. See Note 7 to
our consolidated financial statements.
Charge Related to the T ransaction with T ingyi
In 2015, we recorde d a pre- and after-tax charge of $73 million ($0.05 per share) in the AMENA segment related to a write-of f of
the value of a call option to increase our holding in T AB to 20%.
See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.
Venezuela Impairment Charges
In 2015, we recorded pre- and after-tax charges of $1.4 billion ($0.91 per share) in the Latin America segment related to the
impairment of investments in our wholly-owned V enezuelan subsidiaries and beverage joint venture.
For additional information on V enezuela, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks.”
Venezuela Remeasurement Charges
In 2014, we recorded a $105 million  net charge related to our remeasurement of the bolivar for certain net monetary assets of our
Venezuelan businesses. $ 126 million  of this charge was recorded in corporate unallocated expenses, with the balance (equity income
of $21 million ) recorded in our Latin America segment. In total, this net charge had an after-tax impact of $105 million  or $0.07 per
share.

America segment. In total, this net char ge had an after -tax impact of $ 111 million  or $0.07 per share.
For additional information on V enezuela, see “Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
Merger and Integration Charges
In 2013, we incurred merger and integration charges of $10 million  ($8 million  after-tax or $0.01 per share) related to our
acquisition of WBD, all of which were recorded in the ESSA segment.
Tax Benefits
In 2015, we recogn ized a non-cash tax benefit of $230 million  ($0.15 per share) associated with our agreement with the IRS
resolving substantially all open matters related to the audits for taxable years 2010 through 2011, which reduced our reserve for
uncertain tax positions for the tax years 2010 and 201 1.
In 2013, we recogn ized a non-cash tax benefit of $209 million  ($0.13 per share) associated with our agreement with the IRS
resolving all open matters related to the audits for taxable years 2003 through  2009, which reduced our reserve for uncertain tax
positions for the tax years 2003 through 2012.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
Non-GAAP Measures
Certain measures contained in this Form 10-K are financial measures that are adjusted for items affecting comparability (see “Items
Affecting Comparability” for a detailed list and description of each of these items), as well as, in certain instances, adjusted for
foreign exchange. These measures are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Items
adjusted for currency assume foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable
prior -year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S.
dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the
prior year average foreign exchange rates. We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results
as they are indicativ e of our ongoing performance and reflect how managemen t evaluates our operational results and trends. These
measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP reporting measures. See “Organic Revenue Growth,”
“Free Cash Flow” and “Net Return on Invested Capital.”
Results of Operations — Consolidated Review
In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below , “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over -year impact of discrete
pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different
countries and “net pricing” reflects the year-over -year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts
and allowa nces. Additionally , “acquisitio ns and divestitures,” except as otherwise noted, reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity ,
including the impact of acquisitions,  divestitures and changes in owners hip or control in consolidated subsidiaries and
nonconsolidated equity investees. The impact of the structural change related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses is
presented separately .

Volume
Our bever age volum e in the NAB, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segme nts reflects sales to authorized bottlers, independent
distributors and retailers, as well as the sale of beverages bearing Company- owned or licensed trademarks that have been sold
through our authorized independent bottlers. Bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) are not
necessarily equal during any given period due to seasonality , timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices
and other factors. While our beverage revenues are not entirely based on BCS volume, as there are independent bottlers in the supply
chain, we believe that BCS is a valuable measure as it quantifies the sell-through of our beverage products at the consumer level.
Sales of products from our unconsolida ted joint ventures are reflected in our reported volume. NAB, Latin America, ESSA and
AMENA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products
through a joint ventu re with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and NAB further , either independently or in conjunction with
third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In addition,
AMENA licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with
Tingyi.
Our food and snacks  volume in the FLNA, QFNA, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segments is reported on a system-wide basis,
which includes our own sales and the sales by our noncontrolled affiliate s of snacks bearing Company-owned or licensed
trademarks.
Servings
Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i.e., kilos, gallons, pounds and case sales), a common
servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions’ physical volume measures are
converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products.
In 2015  and 2014 , total servings increased 1% compared to 2014  and 2013 , respectiv ely. Servi ngs growth in 2015 excludes the
fourth quarter 2014 results of our Venezuelan businesses, which were deconsol idated effective as of the end of the third quarter of
2015.

2015
On a reported basis, total operating profit decreased 13% and opera ting margin decreased 1.2 percentage points. Operating profit
performance was primarily driven by certain operating cost increases, unfavorable foreign exchange, higher commodity costs and
increased advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by effective net pricing, the benefit of actions
associated with our productivity initiati ves, which contributed more than $1 billion in cost reductions across a number of expense
categories throughou t all of our segments, and volume growth. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”)
negatively impacted operating profit performance by 9 percentage points and decreased total operating margin by 1.4 percentage
points, primarily reflecting the Venezuela impairment charges. Higher commodity inflation negatively impacted reported operating
profit performance by 5 percentage points, primarily attributable to inflation in the Latin America and ESSA segments, partially
offset by deflation in the NAB, FLNA, AMENA and QFNA segments. Addi tionally , impairment charges in the QFNA segment
associated with our MQD joint venture and the fourth quarter impact of our Venezuelan businesses (as a result of the
deconsolidation) each negatively impacted reported operating profit performanc e by 1 percentage point. Other corporate unallocated
expenses decreased 3%, primarily reflecting decreased pension expense, partially offset by increased research and development
costs and char ges associated with productivity initiatives outside the scope of the 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans.
2014
On a reported basis, total operating profit decreased 1% and operating margin decreased 0.2 percentage points. Operating profit
performance was primarily driven by certain operating cost increases including strategic initiatives related to capacity and capability ,
higher commodity costs and unfavorabl e foreign exchange. Commodity inflation negatively impacted operating profit performance
by 4 percentage points, primarily attributable to inflation in the Latin America and ESSA segments, partially offset by deflation in
the NAB and FLNA segments. These impacts were partially of fset by favorable ef fective net pricing and the

productivity initiatives outside the scope of the 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans negatively impacted operating profit performance
by nearly 1 percenta ge point, primarily in the ESSA and AMENA segments.  Other corporate unallocated expenses decreased 8%,
primarily reflecting decreased pension expense, as well as the lapping of increm ental investments into our business in the prior year,

2015
Net interest expense increased $87 million , reflecting higher rates on our debt balances and lower gains on the market value of
investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation costs.
The reported tax rate increased 1.0 percentage point reflecting the impact  of the Venezuela impairment charges, which had no
accompanying tax benefit, partially offset by the favorable resolution with the IRS of substantially all open matters related to the
audits for taxable years 2010 and 201 1.
Net income attributable to PepsiCo decreased 16% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share decreased 14%. Items
affecting comparabi lity (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) negatively impacted net income attributable to PepsiCo by 12
percentage points and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share by 13 percentage points.

2014
Net interest expense increased $ 10 million, primarily reflecting lower gains on the market value of investments used to economically
hedge a portion of our deferred compensation costs, partially of fset by higher interest income due to higher average cash balances.
The report ed tax rate increased 1.4 perce ntage points, primarily due to lapping the prior year impact of the favorab le resolution with
the IRS of audits for taxable years 2003 through 2009, partially of fset by favorable resolution of certain tax matters in 2014.
Net income attributable to PepsiCo decreased 3% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share decreased 1%. Items

Organic Revenue Growth
Organic revenue growth is a significant measure we use to monitor net revenue performance. However , it is not a measure provided
by U.S. GAAP . Therefore, this measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP net revenue growth. In order
to compute our organic revenue growth results, we exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes,
including the Venezuela deconsolidation , and foreign exchange translation  from reported net revenue growth. See also “Non-GAAP

Net revenue grew 2% and volume grew 1%. The net revenue growth was driven by effective net pricing and the volume growth. The
volume growth reflects mid-single-digit growth in variety packs and trademark Tostitos, double-digit growth in trademark
Smartfood and low-single-digit growth in trademark Doritos. These increases were partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in
trademark Lay’ s.
Operating profit grew 6%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and planned cost reductions across a number of expense
categories, as well as lower commodity  costs, which contributed 5 percentage points to operating profit growth, primarily cooking
oil and packaging. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives, as well as
higher advertising and marketing expenses.

Net revenue declined 1% and volume grew slightly . The net revenue decline reflects unfavorable foreign exchange, which
negatively impacted net revenue performance by 2 percentage points, partially offset by the volume growth. The volume growth
reflects mid-single digit growth in ready-to-eat cereals and Aunt Jemima syrup and mix, partially offset by a double-digit decline in
MQD products and mid-single digit declines in both grits and bars.
Operating profit decreased 10%, reflecting MQD impairment charges, which included a fourth quarter charge related to ceasing
operations of our joint venture as well as the lapping of the gain associated with the divestiture of a cereal business in the prior year,
each negatively impacting operating profit performance by 12 and 3 percentage points, respectively . In addition, operating profit
performance was also negatively impacted by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These
impacts were partially offset by planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories, favorable mix and the volume
growth, as well as lower commodity costs, which positively contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit performance.
2014
Net reven ue decline d 2% and volume was even with the prior year. The net revenue decline primarily reflects unfavorable net
pricing and unfavorable foreign exchange, which negatively impacted net revenue performance by 1 percentage point. The volume
performance reflects low-single-digit declines in Aunt Jemima syrup and mix and ready-to-eat cereals, a mid-single-digit decline in
regional grains, as well as a double-digit decline in cookies, of fset by low-single-digit growth in Oatmeal.
Operating profit increased 1%, primarily  driven by planned cost reduc tions across a number of expense categories, improvement in
our share of the operating results of our MQD joint venture, which reflected start-up costs in the prior year, and lower advertising
and marketing expenses. Additionally , the net gain on the divestiture of a cereal business contributed 3 percentage points to
operating profit growth. These impacts were partially offset by the unfavorable net pricing and mix, as well as certain operating cost

credit markets will not impair our ability  to access these markets on terms comm ercially acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 9 to our
consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities. See also “Unfavorable economic conditions may have an
adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
As of December 26, 2015 , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries of $11.1 billion
outside the U.S. To the extent foreign earnings are repatriated, such amounts would be subject to income tax liabilities, both in the
U.S. and in various applicable foreign jurisdictions.
Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality . Working capital needs are impacted
by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns, and generally
lowest in the first quarter . On a continu ing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our
business results, including acquisitions,  divestitures, joint ventures, share repur chases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives,
and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.
The table below summarizes our cash activity:  
 2015  2014  2013
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 10,580  $ 10,506  $ 9,688
Net cash used for investing activities $ (3,569 ) $ (4,937 ) $ (2,625 )
Net cash used for financing activities $ (3,828 ) $ (8,264 ) $ (3,789 )
Operating Activities
During 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.6 billion, compared to $10.5 billion in the prior year. The operating
cash flow performance in part reflects lapping the impact of prior -year discretionary pension and retiree medical contributions,
pertaining to the lump sum settlement payments, in the United States of $388 million ($261 million after-tax). In addition, working
capital (comprised of changes in accounts and notes receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and accounts
payable and other current liabilities, each adjusted for the effects of currency translation and the Venezuela deconsolidation) reflects
favorable comparisons to the prior year . These increases were partially of fset by unfavorable operating profit performance.
During 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.5 billion, compared to $9.7 billion in the prior year. The operating
cash flow performan ce primarily reflects lapping the impact of 2013 U.S. federal net cash tax payments of $758 million, including
interest, related to an agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits for taxable years 2003 through 2009
and $226 million of cash payments for other federal, state and local tax matters related to open tax years. See Note 5 to our
consolidated financial statements. This impact was partially offset by the discretionary pension and retiree medical contributions
described above.
Also see “Free Cash Flow” below for certain other items impacting net cash provided by operating activities.

Investing Activities
During 2015, net cash used for investing activities was $3.6 billion, primaril y reflecting net capital spending of $2.7 billion, a
reduction of cash of $568 million due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries and net purchases of debt securities
greater than three months of $317 million. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital
spending by division and for further discussion of Venezuela. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further
discussion of our investments in debt securities.
During 2014, net cash used for investing activities was $4.9 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $2.7 billion and net
purchases of debt securities greater than three months of $2.4 billion.
We expect 2016  net capital spendin g to be approximate ly $3 billion , within our long-te rm capital spending target of less than or
equal to 5% of net revenue.
Financing Activities
During 2015 , net cash used for financing activities was $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our
shareholders through  dividend payments and share repurchases of $9.0 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt
of $4.6 billion and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $0.5 billion.
During 2014 , net cash used for financing activities was $8.3 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our
shareholders through  dividend payments and share repurchases of $8.7 billion and net payments of short-term borrowings of $2.0
billion, partially offset by net proceeds  from long-term debt of $1.7 billion and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $0.8
billion.
We annually review our capital structur e with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity .
On February 1 1, 2015, we announced a new share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $12.0 billion of PepsiCo
common stock commencing from July 1, 2015 and expiring on June 30, 2018. This repurchase program was in addition to the $10.0
billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors and publicly announced in the first quarter of 2013, which
commenced on July 1, 2013 and under which we completed repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, on
February 1 1, 2016 , we announced a 7.1%  increase in our annu alized dividend to $3.01  per share from $2.81  per share, effective with
the dividen d that is expected to be paid in June 2016. We expect to return a total of $7 billion  to shareholders in 2016  through share
repurchases of approximately $3 billion  and dividends of approximately $4 billion.
Free Cash Flow
We focus on free cash flow as an important element in evaluating our perform ance. Since net capital spending is essential to our
product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of
cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities.
Additionally , we consider certain items (included in the table below) in evaluating free cash flow. We believe investors should
consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow results. Free cash flow excluding certain items is the primary measure we use
to monitor cash flow performance. However , free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items are not measures provided by
U.S. GAAP . Therefore, these measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP cash flow measures.

In all years presente d, free cash flow was used primarily to pay dividends and repurchase shares. We expect to continue to return
free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access,
which we believe will ensure appropriate financial flexibility and ready acces s to global capital and credit markets at favorable
interest rates. However , see “Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a
downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for certain factors
that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.
Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency , especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not
as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to
access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-
term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced
historically , and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See “Our borrowing costs and
access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrad e or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.” in
“Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.
Net Return on Invested Capital
ROIC is a metric management uses to monitor the profitability of our utilized capital. We believe this metric balances our operating
results with asset and liability management, and may contribute to long-term shareholder value creation. In addition, we use net
ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability , to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis
because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects
how mana gement evaluates our operating results and trends. We believe the calculation of net ROIC, excluding items affecting
comparability , provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider
when evaluating our capital allocation discipline. Net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability , is not a measure provided by
GAAP . Therefore, it is not, and should not be, viewed as a substitute for ROIC.
71
Table of Contents
We calculate net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability , by using net income attributable to PepsiCo, excluding items
affecting comparability , plus after-tax interest expense, divided by a quarterly average of invested capital less cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments adjusted for these items.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements, other than in the normal course of business. Additionally ,
we do not enter into off-balance-sheet transactions specifically structured to provide income or tax benefits or to avoid recognizing
or disclosing assets or liabilities. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 — Basis of Pr esentation and Our Divisions
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of
PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the
equity method based  on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial
decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates, as our
ownership in these other af filiates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.
Raw mate rials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production
planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and
delivering finished product are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The prepa ration of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among
other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and
useful lives for intan gible assets, and future cash flows associated with impairm ent testing for perpetual brands, goodwill and other
long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe
appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances
change. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision , actual results could differ significantly from these
estimates.
Prior to the end of the third quarter of 2015, the financial position and results of operations of our Venezuelan snack and beverage
businesses were included in our consolidated financial statements. Effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, we did not
meet the accounting criteria for control over our wholly-owned Venezuelan subsidiaries and significant influence over our joint
venture, and therefore we deconsolida ted our Venezuelan subsidiaries from our consolidated financial statements and began
accounting for our investments in our wholly-owned Venezuelan subsidiaries and our joint venture using the cost method of
accounting. See subsequent discussion of “Venezuela”; for further unaudited information, see “Our Business Risks” and “Our
Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December , resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years (and our
fiscal 2016 results will include an extra week). While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, most of our
international operati ons report on a monthly calendar basis. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for all
reporting periods presented:
 
Quarter   U.S. and Canada   International
First Quarter   12 weeks   January , February
Second Quarter   12 weeks   March, April and May
Third Quarter   12 weeks   June, July and August
Fourth Quarter   16 weeks   September , October , November and December

Our Divisions
Through our operati ons, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a
wide varie ty of convenient and enjoyabl e beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries
and territories with our largest operations in North America, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom and Brazil. Division results are
based on how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of and allocates resources to our divisions and are considered
our reportable segments. For additional unaudited information on our divisions, see “Our Operations” contained in “Item 1.
Business.” The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation
methodologies:
•share-based compensation expense;
•pension and retiree medical expense; and
•derivatives.
Share-Based Compensation Expense
Our divisi ons are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as
an incremental employee compensation cost. The allocation of share-based compensation expense in 2015  was approximately 15%
to FLNA, 2% to QFNA , 23% to NAB, 7% to Latin America, 13% to ESSA,  11% to AMENA and 29% to corpor ate unallo cated
expenses. We had similar allocations of share-based compensation expense to our divisions in 2014  and 2013 . The expense allocated
to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which
division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in
corporate unallocated expenses.
Pension and Retir ee Medical Expense
Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates, as well as amortization of costs related to certain pension
plan amen dments and gains and losses due to demographics (including mortality assumptions and salary experience) are reflected in
division results for North American employees. Division results also include interest costs, measured at fixed discount rates, for
retiree medical plans. Interest costs for the pension plans, pension asset returns and the impact of pension funding, and gains and
losses other than those due to demographics, are all reflected in corporate unallo cated expenses. In addition, for our North American
plans, corporate unallocated expenses include the difference between the service costs measured at a fixed discount rate (included in
division results as noted above) and the total service costs determined using the plans’ discount rates as disclosed in Note 7 to our
consolidated financial statements.
Derivatives
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products,
metals and ener gy. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with
the resulting gains and losses record ed in corporate unallocated expenses, as either cost of sales or selling, general and
administrative expe nses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division
results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize
80
Table of Contents
the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in corporate
unallocated expense s. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative
purposes.

Venezuela
Prior to the end of the third quarter of 2015, the financial position and results  of operations of our Venezuelan businesses, which
consist of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and our beverage joint venture with our franchise bottler in V enezuela, were reported under
highly inflationary accounting, with the functional currency of the U.S. dollar .
The Venezuelan government has maint ained currency controls and a fixed exchange rate since 2003 and has created additional
exchange mechanisms and issued several exchange agreements governing the scope and applicability of each, while continuing to
maintain control over the exchange rates and, to an increasingly significant extent, over the distribution of U.S. dollars under each
mechanism.
During 2015, there was a three-tiered exchange rate mechanism in Venezuela for exchanging bolivars into U.S. dollars: (1) the
government-operated National Center of Foreign Commerce (CENCOEX); (2) the government-operated auction-based
Supplementary Foreign Currency Administration System (SICAD); and (3) an open market Marginal Foreign Exchange System
(SIMADI).
These three mechanisms became increasingly illiquid over time. We believe that significant uncertainty continues to exist regarding
the exchange mechanisms in Venezuela,  including the nature of transactions that are eligible to flow through CENCOEX, SICAD or
SIMADI, or any other new exchange mechanism that may emer ge, how any such mechanisms will operate in the future, as well as
the availability of U.S. dollars under each mechanism. The amount of U.S. dollars made available to our Venezuelan entities through
CENCOEX declined significantly since 2014 and worsened during the third quarter of 2015. In addition,
83
Table of Contents
our Venezuelan entities were not able to participate in SICAD auctions during 2015, as the auctions that were held were not for our
industry , and had limited access to the SIMADI market since its inception.
The evolv ing conditions in Venezuela, including increasingly restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to dollars
through official currency exchange markets, resulted in an other -than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan
bolivar and the U.S. dollar , which significantly impacted our ability to effectively manage our Venezuelan businesses, including
restrictions on the ability of our Venezuelan businesses to import certain raw materials to maintain normal production and to settle
U.S. dolla r-denominated obligations. The exchange restrictions, combined with other regulations that have limited our ability to
import certain raw materials, also increasingly constrained our ability to make and execute operational decisions regarding our
businesses in Venezuela. In addition, the inability of our Venezuelan businesses to pay dividends, which remain subject to
Venezuelan government approvals, restricted our ability to realize the earnings generated out of our Venezuelan businesses. We
expect these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future.
As a result of these factors, we concluded that, effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, we did not meet the accounting
criteria for control over our wholly-own ed Venezuelan subsidiaries, and therefore we deconsolidated our wholly-owned Venezuelan
subsidiaries effectiv e as of the end of the third quarter of 2015. We also conclud ed that, effective as of the end of the third quarter of
2015, due to the above-mentioned factors and other matters impacting the operation of our joint venture and the distribution of its
products, we no longer had significant  influence over our joint venture, which was previously accounted for under the equity
method. As a result of these conclusions , effective at the end of the third quarter of 2015, we began accounting for our investments
in our wholly-owned  Venezuelan subsidiaries and our joint venture using the cost method of accounting and recorded pre- and after-
tax charges of $1.4 billion  in our Consolidated Statement of Income to reduce the value of the cost method investments to their
estimated fair values, resulting in a full impairment. The impairment char ges primarily included approximately $1.2 billion  related to
our investments in previously consol idated Venezuelan subsidiaries and our joint venture and $111 million  related to the
reclassification of cumulative translation  losses. The estimated fair value of the investments in our Venezuelan entities was derived
using discounted cash flow analyses, including U.S. dollar exchange and disco unt rate assumptions that reflected the inflation and
economic uncertainty in Venezuela, and are considered non-recurring Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy . The
factors that led to the above-mentioned conclusions at the end of the third quarter of 2015 continued to exist as of the end of 2015.
During 2015 and prior to the end of the third quarter of 2015, we used the SICAD exchange rate to remeasure our net monetary
assets in Venezuela, except for certain other net monetary assets that we believed qualified for the fixed exchange rate (including
requests for remitta nce of dividends submitted to CENCOEX in certain prior years at the fixed exchange rate and payables for
imports of essential goods approved by CENCOEX).
During 2015, the results of our operations in Venezuela, which reflected the months of January through August, were included in our
Consolidated Statement of Income using a combination of the fixed exchange and SICAD rates, as appropriate. As of the end of
2015, consistent with the end of the third quarter of 2015, we did not consolidate the assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan
subsidiaries in our Consolidated Balanc e Sheet. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we no longer included the financial results
of our Venezuelan businesses in our Consolidated Statement of Income and our financial results only included revenue relating to
the sales of inventor y to our Venezuelan  entities to the extent cash was received for those sales. Any dividends from our Venezuelan
entities will be recorded as income upon  receipt of the cash. We did not receive any U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter of 2015 from
our V enezuelan entities. Our ongoing contractual commitments to our V enezuelan businesses are not material.

Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of
return. However , our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from
store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly , our policy for certain
warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. Based on our experience with this practice, we have
reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. For additional unaudited information on our revenue recognition and
related policies, including our policy on bad debts, see “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, includ ing Wal-Mart. In 2015 , sales to Wal-Mart (including
Sam’ s) represented approximately 13% of our total net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottler s, which are
used in finished goods sold by them to W al-Mart. W e have not experienced credit issues with these customers.
Total Marketplace Spending
We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes
sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a
reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing merchandising activities on our behalf, such as payments for
in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail
prices. It also includes support provided  to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.
While most of these  incentive arrangements have terms of no more than one year, certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring
rights, may extend beyond one year. Costs incurred to obtain these arrangement s are recognized over the shorter of the economic or
contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances  of $321 million  as of December 26, 2015  and $355
million  as of December 27, 2014  are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet. For
additional unaudited information on our sales incentives, see “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $3.9 billion  in 2015,
2014 and 2013 , including advertising expenses of $2.4 billion  in 2015 , $2.3 billion  in 2014  and $2.4 billion  in 2013 . Deferred
advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:
•media and personal service prepayments;
•promotional materials in inventory; and
•production costs of future media advertising.
Deferred advertising costs of $40 million  and $42 million  as of December 26, 2015  and December 27, 2014 , respectively , are
classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.
Distribution Costs
Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative
expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $9.4 billion  in 2015 , $9.7 billion  in 2014  and $9.4 billion  in 2013 .
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
85
Table of Contents
Software Costs
We capita lize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining
computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be
used as intended. Capitalized software costs include only (i) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or
obtaining computer software, (ii) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software
projects and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in
property , plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the
estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate 5 to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $202 million  in 2015 , $208
million  in 2014  and $197 million  in 2013 . Net capitalized software and development costs were $863 million  and $944 million  as of
December 26, 2015  and December 27, 2014 , respectively .
Commitments and Contingencies
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as
commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. W e recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when
a loss is probable and estimable. For additional information on our commitments, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial
statements.
Research and Development
We engag e in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation
globally . Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and
development costs were $754 million , $718 million  and $665 million  in 2015 , 2014  and 2013 , respectively , and are reported within
selling, general and administrative expenses.
See “Research and Development” in “Item 1. Business” for additional unaudited information about our research and development
activities.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually , using either a
qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter . Where we use the qualitative
assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered
include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and
significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an
impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
In the quantitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, if the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset
exceeds its estimated fair value, as determined by its discounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
that excess. Quantitative assessment of goodwill is performed using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level. A
reporting unit can be a division or business within a division. The first step compares the carrying value of a reporting unit,
including goodwill, with its estimated fair value, as determined by its discounted cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit
exceeds its estimated fair value, we complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should
record, if any. In the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the estimated fair
value of the reportin g unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). The
amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.
The quantitative assessment, described above requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash
86
Table of Contents
flows or income consistent with management’ s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions
and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) based on market data available at the
time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other
factors to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for
nonamortizable intangible assets, such as forecasted growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best
available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans.
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated
fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.

•Translation of Financial Statements of For eign Subsidiaries  – Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into
U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and
expenses. Adjustme nts resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity as currency translation adjustment.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted
In 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance which requires that debt issuance costs related to a
recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability . We
adopted the provisio ns of this guidance as of the beginning of our second quarte r of 2015, and that adoption did not have a material
impact on our financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Y et Adopted
In 2016, the FASB  issued guidance that generally requires companies to measure investments in other entities, except those
accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The standard is effective
in 2018 and early adoption is not permitted. W e are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.
87
Table of Contents
In 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the
balance sheet. The standard is effective in 2017 with early adoption permitted.  The guidance is not expected to have a material
impact on our balance sheet. W e are evaluating the timing for adoption of this guidance.
In 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The
guidance is effective in 2017 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial
statements. W e are evaluating the timing for adoption of this guidance.
In 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition, which provides for a single five-step model to be applied to all revenue
contracts with customers. The new standard also requires additional financial statement disclosures that will enable users to
understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. We have an option
to use either a retrospective approach or a cumulative effect adjustment appro ach to implement the guidance. In 2015, the FASB
issued a deferral of the effective date of the guidance to 2018, with early adoption permitted in 2017. We are currently evaluating the

Total restructuring and impairment charges and other productivity initiatives$ 320 $ 485 $ 163
2014 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan
The 2014 Productivity Plan includes the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believe will strengthen our food, snack
and beverage businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing
footprint, including  closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets;
expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency . The 2014 Productivity Plan is in
addition to the 2012 Productivity Plan and is expected to continue the benefits of that plan.
In 2015 , 2014  and 2013, we incurred restructuring charges of $169 million  ($134 million  after-tax or $0.09 per share) , $357 million
($262 million  after-tax or $0.17 per share) and $53 million  ($39 million  or $0.02  per share ), respectively , in conjunction  with our
2014 Prod uctivity Plan. All of these charges were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and primarily relate to
severance and other employee-related costs, asset impairments (all non-cash), and other costs associated with the implementation of
our initiatives, including contract termination costs. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 26, 2015  is expected to
be paid by the end of 2016 .

2012 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan
The 2012 Productivity Plan included actions in every aspect of our business that we believe would strengthen our complementary
food, snack and beverage businesses by: leveraging new technologies and processes across PepsiCo’ s operations, go-to-market and
information systems; heightening the focus on best practice sharing across the globe; consolidating manufacturing, warehouse and
sales facilities; and implementing simplified organization structures, with wider spans of control and fewer layers of management.
The 2012 Productivity Plan has enhanced PepsiCo’ s cost-competitiveness and provided a source of funding for future brand-
building and innovation initiatives.
In 2015 , 2014  and 2013 , we incur red restru cturing charges of $61 million  ($50 million  after-tax or $0.03 per share), $61 million
($54 million  after-tax or $0.04 per share) and $110 million  ($90 million  after-tax or $0.06 per share ), respecti vely, in conjunction
with our 2012 Produ ctivity Plan. All of these charges were recorded in selling , general and administrative expenses and primarily
relate to severance and other employee -related costs, asset impairments (all non-cash), and contract termination costs. We do not
expect any further charges associated with our 2012 Productivity Plan. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 26,
2015  is expected to be paid by the end of 2016 .

efficiency initiatives  outside the scope of the 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans, including $48 million  in Latin America, $5 million
in ESSA, $20 million  in AMENA and $17 million  in Corpor ate. In 2014, we incurred pre-tax charges of $67 million  ($54 million
after-tax or $0.04  per share) related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives, including $11 million  in Latin America, $26
million  in ESSA and $30 million  in AMEN A. Non-c ash charges in 2015 and 2014 were $10 million  and $13 million , respectively .
Cash payments in 2015 and 2014 were  $57 million  and $3 million , respectively . All of these charges were recorded in selling,
general and administrative expenses and primarily reflect severance and other  employee-related costs and asset impairments (all
non-cash). These initiatives were not included in items affecting comparability . Substantially all of the restructuring accrual of $74
million  at December 26, 2015  is expected to be paid by the end of 2016 . See additional unaudited information  in “Results of

Depreciable and amortizable assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down
to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine
whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision. For additional unaudited information on our
policies for amortizable brands, see “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

Nonamortizable Intangible Assets
We did not recogniz e any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the fiscal years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014
and December 28, 2013. In 2015, we performed the impairment analysis for goodwill for all of our reporting units using the
qualitative approach  and concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were greater
than their carrying amounts. After reaching this conclusion, no further testing was performed.
We recogn ized no material impairment charges for nonamortizable intangible assets in each of the fiscal years ended December 26,
2015, December 27, 2014 and Decembe r 28, 2013. In 2014, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges in ESSA for nonamortizable
intangible assets of $23 million . Based on our year-end assessment, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and
acquired franchise rights recorded at NAB exceed their carrying values. However , there could be an impairment of the carrying
value of NAB’ s reacquired and acquired  franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of NAB’ s
CSD business do not achieve our estimated future cash flows or if macroeco nomic conditions result in a future increase in the
weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the recent economic and political
developments in Russia on the estimate d fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia and have concluded that there
is no impairment as of December 26, 2015. However , a further deterioration in these conditions in Russia could potentially require
us to record an impairment charge for these assets in the future. For additional information on our policies for nonamortizable
intangible assets, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.

Reserves
A number of years may elapse before a particular matter , for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved.
The numb er of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related
open tax audits are as follows:
Jurisdiction  Years Open to Audit Years Currently
Under Audit
United States  2010-2014  None
Mexico  2010-2014  None
United Kingdom  2013-2014  None
Canada (Domestic)  2011-2014  2011-2013
Canada (International)  2008-2014  2008-2013
Russia  2012-2014  2012-2014
While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter , we believe that our
reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of
changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution
would be recognized  as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resoluti on. For further unaudited information on the impact
of the resolution of open tax issues, see “Other Consolidated Results” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reache d an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all open matters related to the audits of
taxable years 2010 and 2011 (two imma terial matters were still open as of December 26, 2015). The agreement resulted in a fourth
quarter non-cash tax benefit totaling $230 million .
In 2013, we reached  an agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters relate d to the audits for taxable years 2003 through 2009.
As a resul t, we made U.S. Federal net cash tax payments of $758 million , including interest. The settlement reduced our 2013 net
cash provided by operating activities and our reserves for uncertain tax positions for the tax years 2003 through 2012 and resulted in
a non-cash tax benefit of $209 million  in 2013. In addition, payments for other U.S. Federal, state and local tax matters related to
open tax years totaling $226 million  were made in 2013. See additional unaudited information in “Items Af fecting Comparability” in
Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
As of December 26, 2015 , the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilitie s, was $1,547 million . We
accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for incom e taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $144 million  as
of December 26, 2015 , of which  $14 million  of expens e was recognized in 2015 . The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in
other liabilities, was $141 million  as of December 27, 2014 , of which $31 million  of expense was recognized in 2014 .

jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior perio ds to reduce future taxable income. These operating
losses will expire as follows: $0.2 billion  in 2016 , $9.8 billion  between 2017  and 2035 and $0.9 billion  may be carried forward
indefinitely . We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Undistributed International Earnings
As of December 26, 2015 , we had approximately $40.2 billion  of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to
reinvest earnings outside the U.S. for the foreseeable future and, therefore, have not recognized any U.S. tax expense on these
earnings. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized U.S. tax expense on these reinvested international
earnings.
Note 6 — Shar e-Based Compensation
Our share- based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with the
interests of our shareholders. Stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs) and PepsiCo equity
performance units (PEPunits) are grant ed to employees under the shareholder -approved 2007 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP).
Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of
the service period. PSUs are awards where the number of shares delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period
depends on PepsiCo’ s performance against specified targets. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents
that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable. PEPunits provide an
opportunity to earn shares of PepsiCo common stock with a value that adjusts based upon changes in PepsiCo’ s absolute stock price
as well as PepsiCo’ s Total Shareholder Return relative to the S&P 500 over a three -year performance period.
The Comp any may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and
the vesting of RSUs and PSUs as well as PEPunits.
As of December 26, 2015 , 91 million  shares were available for future share-based compensation grants.

As of December 26, 2015 , there was $335 million  of total unrecogni zed compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two
years.
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions
We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to
measure stock optio n expense at the date of grant. The fair value of RSUs is measured at the market price of the Company’ s stock on
the date of grant. The fair value of PSUs is measured at the market price of the Company’ s stock on the date of grant with the
exception of market-based awards, for which we use the Monte-Carlo simulation option-pricing model to determine the fair value.
The Monte-Carlo simulation option-pricing model uses the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes model; however , it also
further incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Compensation
costs related to these awards are recognized regardless of whether the marke t condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite
service has been provided.
All stock option grants have an exercise  price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally
have a 10-year term. We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively . Repricing of awards
would require shareholder approval under the L TIP.
The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three  years. Awards to
employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date
that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. Executives who are
awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or
RSUs, or a combin ation thereof. Executives who elect RSUs receive one RSU for every four stock options that would have
otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and, through 2015, were granted
a combination of 60% PEPunits  measurin g both absolute and relative stock price performance and 40% long-term cash based on
achievement of specific performance operating metrics. Beginning in 2016, certain executive officers and other senior executives
will be granted 66% performance stock units and 34% long-term  cash, each of which will be subject to pre-established performance
targets. Certain executives are granted performance-based stock units which require the achievement of specified financial and/or
operational perform ance metrics. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold
based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award.
Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:
2015 2014 2013
Expected life 7 years 6 years 6 years
Risk-free interest rate 1.8% 1.9% 1.1%
Expected volatility 15% 16% 17%
Expected dividend yield 2.7% 2.9% 2.7%

Table of Contents
The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected  to hold their options. It is based on our historical
experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life.
Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield
is estimate d over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock
price.

Note 7 — Pension, Retir ee Medical and Savings Plans
In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company offered certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit
pension plans the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’ s pension benefit
(payable in cash or rolled over into a qualified retirement plan or IRA). In the fourth quarter of 2014, we made a discretionary
contribution of $388 million  to fund substantial ly all of these payments. The Company recorded a pre-ta x non-cash settlement
charge of $141 million  ($88 million  after-tax or $0.06  per share) in 2014 as a result of this transaction. See additional unaudited
information in “Items Affecting Compa rability” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.
During 2014, we revised our mortality assumptions to include the impact of the new set of mortality tables issued by the Society of
Actuaries, adjusted to reflect our experience and future expectations. This resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligation
of our U.S. pension  and retiree medical programs. We also reviewed and revised other demographic assumptions to reflect recent
experience. The net effect of these chang es and certain plan design changes resulted in an increase of approximately $150 million  in
the projected benefit obligation at December 27, 2014.
The provisions of both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act are
reflected in our retiree medical expenses and liabilities and were not material to our financial statements.
Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual return
on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets, and from changes in our assumptions are determined at each measurement
date. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities, a
portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year based upon the average remaining service period of
active plan participants, which is approximately 11 years for pension expense and approximately 8 years for retiree medical expense.
The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is
included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants.

Of the total projected pension benefit liability at year-end 2015 , $780 million  relates to plans that we do not fund because the
funding of such plans does not receive favorable tax treatment.
Future Benefit Payments and Funding
Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021-25
Pension $ 755 $ 780 $ 835 $ 880 $ 930 $ 5,335

(a) Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies are
expected to be approximately $2 to $3 million  for each of the years from 2016  through 2020  and approximately $9 million  in total for 2021 through 2025.
104
Table of Contents
These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans.
In 2016 , we expect to make pension and retiree medical contributions of approximately $215 million , with approximately $65
million  for retiree medical benefits.
Plan Assets
Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction
with plan liabilities,  an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy
is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to
meet the plans’ benefit obligations when  they become due. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-
diversified portfolio  of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our
investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments which are primarily used to reduce risk.
For 2016  and 2015 , our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.5% . Our target investment allocations for U.S. plan
assets are as follows:
 2016 2015
Fixed income 40% 40%
U.S. equity 33% 33%
International equity 22% 22%
Real estate 5% 5%
Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly
review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments to our tar get allocations.
The expec ted return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset
class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels
of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions
annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for
fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the
difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the
effect of reducing year -to-year volatility .

Year of ultimate projected increase (a)2039 2025
(a)During 2015, we revised our retiree trend assumption to reflect our experience and future expectations for changes in the cost of medical coverage, including a longer grade down period to the
ultimate rate.
These assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense and liability , however the cap on our
share of retiree medical costs limits the impact. A 1-percentage-point change in the assumed health care trend rate would have the
following ef fects:
 1%
Increase  1%
Decrease
2015 service and interest cost components $ 4 $ (3)
2015 benefit liability $ 40 $ (36)
Savings Plan
Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans, which are voluntary defined contribution plans. The plans
are designed to help employees accumulate additional savings for retirement, and we make Company matching contributions for
certain employees on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service.
Certain U.S. salaried  employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined  benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an
employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.
In 2015 , 2014  and 2013 , our total Company contributions were $148 million , $130 million  and $122 million , respectively .

Note 8 — Related Party T ransactions
Our related party transactions in 2015 , 2014  and 2013  were not material.
We coordinate, on an aggregate basis, the contract negotiations of raw material requirements, including sweeteners, aluminum cans
and plastic  bottles and closures for us and certain of our independent bottlers. Once we have negotiated the contracts, the bottlers
order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly . Consequently , these transactions are not reflected in
our consolidated financial statements. As the contracting party , we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment
by our bottlers, but we consider this exposure to be remote.
In addition, our joint ventures with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name) and Starbucks sell finished goods (ready-to-drink teas
and coffees, respectively) and concentrate to us and our noncontrolled bottling affiliates. Consistent with accounting for equity
method investments, our joint venture revenue is not included in our consolidated net revenue.
Certain members of our Board of Direct ors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not
participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and
customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In
addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo
and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.

The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for gene ral corporate purposes, including the repayment of
commercial paper .
In 2015 , we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Y ear Credit Agreement) which expires on June
8, 2020. The Five-Y ear Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.7225 billion , subject to
customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion .
Additionally , we may , once a year , request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period.
Also, in 2015 , we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on
June 6, 2016. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.7225 billion , subject to
customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion . We may
request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of
up to one year, which would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The Five-Y ear Credit
Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement together replaced our $3.7725  billion five-year credit agreement dated as of June 9,
2014 and our $3.7725  billion 364-day credit agreement dated as of June 9, 2014. Funds borrowed under the Five-Y ear Credit
Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may
borrow , prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 26, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings
under the Five-Y ear Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.
In addition, as of December 26, 2015 , our international debt of $193 million  was related to borrowings from external parties
including various lines of credit. These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at
least to the extent of our borrowings.

(d) Primarily reflects non-cancelable commitments as of December 26, 2015 .
Most long-term contractual commitments, except for our long-term debt obligations, are not recorded on our balance sheet.
Operating leases primarily represent building leases. Non-cancelable purchasing  commitments are primarily for oranges and orange
juice. Non-cancelable marketing comm itments are primarily for sports marke ting. Bottler funding to independent bottlers is not
reflected in our long-term contractual commitments as it is negotiated on an annual basis. Accrued liabilities for pension and retiree
medical plans are not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments. See Note 7 for additional information regarding our
pension and retiree medical obligations.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements, other than in the normal course of business. See Note 8
regarding contracts related to certain of our bottlers.
See “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for further unaudited information on our borrowings.
Note 10 — Financial Instruments
Derivatives
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of
strategies, including  productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the
identification and effective implementat ion of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives.
Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.
Our hedgi ng strategies include the use of derivatives. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and
qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. Cash flows from
derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange
110
Table of Contents
or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We classify both the earnings
and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item. See “Our Business Risks” in Management’ s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on our business risks.
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in fair value is deferre d in accumulated other comprehensive loss within
common shareholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is recognized in net income. For fair value hedges, changes in fair
value are recognized immediately in earnings, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Hedging transactions are limited to an
underlying exposure. As a result, any change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite
change in the value of the underlying hedged items. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We
perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly , including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit
ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counter party . Based on our most recent assessment of our
counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial
institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.
Commodity Prices
We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased  costs through higher pricing may be limited in the
competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders,
pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw
materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppli ers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than
three  years, to economic ally hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for
agricultural products, metals and energy. Ineffectiveness for those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment was not
material for all periods presented. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment
are marke d to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded  in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of
sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are
subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.
Our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of $1.0 billion  as of December 26, 2015  and $1.2 billion  as of
December 27, 2014 .
Foreign Exchange
Our opera tions outside of the U.S. generated 44% of our net revenue in 2015, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdo m
and Brazil comprising approximately 20% of our net revenue in 2015 . As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the
international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold.
Additionally , we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities
created in the normal course of business . We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts
in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than
two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our
income statement as incurred.
111
Table of Contents
Our foreig n currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.1 billion  as of December 26, 2015  and $2.7 billion  as of
December 27, 2014 . Ineffectiveness for derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment was not material for all periods
presented. For foreign currency derivati ves that do not qualify for hedge accou nting treatment, all losses and gains were offset by
changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings.
Inter est Rates
We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investm ent opportunities and risks, tax consequences and
overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps,
cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.
These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness
has been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency
interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our T reasury locks and swap locks are
entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.
The notional values of the interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 26, 2015  and December 27, 2014  were
$12.5 billion  and $9.3 billion , respectively . Ineffectiveness for derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment was
not material for all periods presented.
As of December 26, 2015 , approximately 33% of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments , was
exposed to variable rates, compared to approximately 25% as of December 27, 2014 .
Available-for-Sale Securities
Investments in debt and marketable equity securities, other than investments accounted for under the equity method, are classified as
available-for -sale. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
Our invest ments in available-for -sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair
value of available-fo r-sale securities are recognized in accumulated other comp rehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity .
Unrealized gains and losses on our inves tments in debt securities as of December 26, 2015  were  not material. The pre-tax unrealized
gains on our investments in marketab le equity securities were $115 million  and $111 million  as of December 26, 2015  and
December 27, 2014 , respectively .
Changes in the fair value of available-for -sale securities impact net income only when such securities are sold or an other -than-
temporary impairment is recognized. We regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any security is other -than-
temporarily impaired. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a
security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any chang es thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will
more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a
security is other -than-temporarily impair ed could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to
any partic ular security . We recorded no other -than-temporary impairment charges for the years ended December 26, 2015  and
December 27, 2014 .

Tingyi-Asahi Beverages Holding Co. Ltd. Call Option
In connection with our transaction with Tingyi in the second quarter of 2012, we received a call option to increase our holding in
TAB to 20% that expired in the fourth quarter of 2015. During the third quarter of 2015 , we concluded that the probability of
exercising the option prior to its expiration was remote and, accordingly , we recorded a pre- and after-tax charge of $73 million
($0.05  per share ) to write off the value of this call option. See “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’ s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The write-of f of this call option did not impact the value of our 5%
indirect equity interest in TAB, which was $538 million  as of December 26, 2015 . We continue to monitor the impact of economic
and other developments on our investment in T AB.

Note 1 1 — Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Shar e
Basic net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share is net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders divided by
the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common
share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect that would occur if in-
the-money employee stock options were exercised and RSUs, PSUs, PEPunits and preferred shares were converted into common
shares. Options to purchase 1.5 million  shares in 2015 and 0.6 million  shares in 2013 were not included in the calculation of diluted
earnings per common share because these options were out-of-the-money . Out-of-the-money options during 2014 were nominal.
These out-of-the-money options had average exercise prices of $99.25  in 2015, $82.25  in 2014 and $75.69  in 2013 .

Management’ s Responsibility for Financial Reporting
To Our Shareholders:
At PepsiCo, our actions – the actions of all our associates – are governed by our Global Code of Conduct. This Code is clearly
aligned with our stated values – a commitment to deliver sustained growth through empowered people acting with responsibility and
building trust. Both the Code and our core values enable us to operate with integ rity – both within the letter and the spirit of the law.
Our Code of Conduct is reinforced consistently at all levels and in all countries. We have maintained strong governance policies and
practices for many years.
The mana gement of PepsiCo is responsible for the objectivity and integrity of our consolidated financial statements. The Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors has engaged independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, to audit our
consolidated financial statements, and they have expressed an unqualified opinion.
We are committed to providing timely , accurate and understandable informati on to investors. Our commitment encompasses the
following:
Maintaining strong contr ols over financial reporting.  Our system of internal control is based on the control criteria framework of
the Committee of Sponsoring Organiz ations of the Treadway Commission published in their report titled Internal Contr ol –
Integrated Framework (2013). The system is designed to provi de reasonable assurance that transactions are executed as authorized
and accurately recorded; that assets are safeguarded; and that accounting records are sufficiently reliable to permit the preparation of
financial statements that conform in all material respects with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. We maintain
disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods. We monitor these internal
controls through self-assessments and an ongoing program of internal audits. Our internal controls are reinforced through our Global
Code of Conduct, which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity , and within both the letter and the spirit of the
law.
Exerting rigor ous oversight of the business.  We continuously review our business results and strategies. This encompasses
financial discipline in our strategic and daily business decisions. Our Executive Committee is actively involved – from
understanding strategies and alternative s to reviewing key initiatives and financial performance. The intent is to ensure we remain
objective in our assessments, construct ively challenge our approach to poten tial business opportunities and issues, and monitor
results and controls.
Engaging strong and effective Corporate Governance from our Board of Directors.  We have an active, capable and dilige nt
Board that meets the required standar ds for independence, and we welcome the Board’ s oversight as a representative of our
shareholders. Our Audit Committee is comprised of independent directors with the financial literacy , knowledge and experience to
provide appropriate oversight. We review our critical accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control matters with them
and encourage their direct communication with KPMG LLP, with our Internal Auditor , and with our General Counsel. We also have
a Compliance & Ethics Department, led by our Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, to coordinate our compliance policies and
practices.
Providing investors with financial results that are complete, transpar ent and understandable.  The consolidated financial
statements and financial information included in this report are the responsibility of management. This includes preparing the
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require estimates based on
management’ s best judgment.

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
PepsiCo, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries (“PepsiCo, Inc.” or “the
Company”) as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive
Income, Cash Flows and Equity for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2015. We also have audited
PepsiCo, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).
PepsiCo, Inc.’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assess ment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’ s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonab le assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material  misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an unders tanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.
A company’ s internal control over finan cial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accord ance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention  or timely detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a
material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financia l statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the financial position of

fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Also in our opinion , PepsiCo, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 26, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control − Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

we continue to enha nce the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective
controls over our financial reporting.

AMENDMENT T O THE
PEPSICO INTERNA TIONAL RETIREMENT PLAN
(As Amended and Restated Effective as of January 1, 2010)
The PepsiCo International Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) is hereby amended as follows, ef fective as of January 1, 2016:
I.
Section 2.01(aa) of the Defined Benefit Program and Section 2.01(z) of the Defined Contribution Program components of the Plan
are amended to read as follows:
“Vice President ” means the V ice President, Global Benefits & W ellness of PepsiCo, Inc.
II.
The Defined Contribution Program component of the Plan is amended as follows:
1.A new sentence is added to the fifth paragraph of Article I – History and General Information to read as follows:
Effective January 1, 2016, the Corporation modified the DC Program to also benefit selected employees: (i) who are
localized to a country outside of their home country , (ii) were participating in a defined benefit or defined contribution
retirement program sponsored immediately prior to their localization and (iii) for whom no company-provided retirement
program is available.
2.Section 2.01(i) is deleted and amended in its entirety to read as follows:
(i) “Eligible Employee ” means an individual who the V ice President has determined (i) is employed exclusively
outside of the United States on the regular staf f of an Approved Employer on a full-time salaried basis, (ii) is neither actively
accruing benefits that are derived from service under the DB Program nor is designated as being eligible to accrue such
benefits, and (iii) is described in at least one of the following paragraphs:
(1) The individual is on an assignment outside of his home country and it is judged to be impractical to have
him participate in the retirement plan(s) sponsored by the Corporation or an af filiated company in his home country;
(2) The individual is on his second (or more) consecutive assignment outside of his home country , and the
retirement plan(s) available to the individual in his home country do not include a retirement plan that is sponsored by
the Corporation or an af filiated company ( e.g., a case where only a statutory plan is available to the individual);
(3) The individual is among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages
whose positions and employment terms are among those that the V ice President has determined make them eligible to
be considered for membership in the DC Program; or
(4) The individual is localized to a country outside of his home country , was actively participating in a
retirement program sponsored by a member of the PepsiCo Or ganization immediately prior to his localization that
will not provide for his continued active participation after his localization, and the local country employer does not
sponsor a retirement plan.
The V ice President shall have the discretion to designate as an Eligible Employee any individual employed by an Approved
Employer on a part-time basis who, but for his
part-time status, otherwise satisfies the requirements of this subsection.
III.
Corrections to the Plan document to carry forth the above amendments, including corrections to cross-references af fected by the
amendment, shall be made as necessary .
