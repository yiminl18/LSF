Reportable
Segments
 
We
 have two reportable segments based on the similar characteristics of the operating segments: domestic resorts and MGM China. We currently own and operate14
 resorts in the United States. MGM China’s operations consist of the MGM Macau resort and casino (“MGM Macau”) and the development of an integrated casino,hotel,
 and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip in Macau (“MGM Cotai”). We have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates,and
 certain other corporate and management operations. CityCenter Holdings, LLC (“CityCenter”) is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also managefor
 a fee. See “Resort Operations” below, as well as “Executive Overview” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsand Note 18 in the accompanying not
es to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information related to our segments. 
Formation
and
Initial
Public
Offering
o
f
MGPOn April
 25, 2016, MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 57,500,000of
 its Class A shares representing limited liability company interests (inclusive of the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 7,500,000 Class Ashares)
 at an initial offering price of $21 per share. MGP used the proceeds from the IPO to purchase operating partnership units in MGM Growth Properties OperatingPartnership
 LP (the “Operating Partnership”), to which we contributed the real estate assets associated with The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York,Monte
 Carlo, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit and Beau Rivage in exchange for Operating Partnership units in the Operating Partnership inconnection with
 the IPO. A wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the “landlord”) subsequently leased the properties to a subsidiary of ours (the “tenant”)pursuant to a long-term
 triple-net master lease agreement (the “master lease”).MGP
 is organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an “UPREIT”) structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by, andsubstantially
 all of its businesses are conducted through the Operating  Partnership. MGP  contributed the proceeds from the IPO to the Operating Partnership in exchangefor
 26.7% of the units in the Operating Partnership. The  sole general partner of the Operating Partnership is also a subsidiary of MGP. MGP has  two classes of authorizedand
 outstanding voting common shares (collectively, the “shares”): Class A shares and a single Class B share. We own MGP’s Class B share, which does not provide itsholder any rights to profits o
r losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or1

 winding
 up of MGP. MGP’s Class A shareholders are entitled to one vote per share, while we, as the owner of the Class B share, are entitled to an amount of votesrepresenting
 a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares so long  as our and our controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP’s) aggregate beneficial ownership of thecombined economic
 interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below 30%. Subsequent to our acquisition of Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa (“Bor gata”) on August 1, 2016 and sub
sequent contribution of Borgata’s real estate assets to MGP, as discussed below, our ownership in the Operating Partnership, which is controlledand
 consolidated by MGP, increased from 73.3% to 76.3%. As a result of the Borg ata  transaction, MGP’s ownership in the Operating Partnership was correspondinglyreduced from 26.7% to 23.7%. The operating partnership units held by us are exchangeable into Class A shares of MGP on a one-to-one basis, or
 cash at the fair value of aClas 
s A share. The determination o f settlement method is at the option of MGP’s independent conflicts committee. 
In
 connection  with  the  formation  of  MGP,  we  borrowed  $4.0  billion  under  certain  bridge  facilities,  the  proceeds  of  which  were  used  to  repay  outstandingobligations under our prior senior credit facility and
 to redeem our 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and our 10% senior notes due 2016. The bridge facilities were subsequentlyassumed
 by the Operating Partnership pursuant to a master contribution agreement by and between MGM, MGP and the Operating Partnership (the “master contributionagreement”). 
The Operating Partnership rep aid the bridge facilities with a combination of proceeds from certain financing transactions and the proceeds from the IPO. 
Acquisition
of
Borgata
Hotel
Casino
&
Spa
 
On August 1, 2016, we completed the acquisiti
on of Boyd Gaming Corporation’s (“Boyd Gaming”) ownership interest in Borgata, at which time Borgata became aconsolidated
 subsidiary of ours. Accordingly, we recorded a gain of approximately $430 million as a result of the acquisition of Borgata and resulting consolidation ofBorgata,
 which  we  previously  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method.  See  Note  4  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional  information.Following
 completion of the acquisition, MGP subsequently acquired Borgata’s real property from a subsidiary of ours in exchange for the assumption by the landlord, asubsidiary of
 MGP, of $545 million of indebtedness from our subsidiary and the issuance of 27.4 million Operating Partnership units to our subsidiary. In connection withthe
 Borgata  transaction,  we  borrowed  $545  million  under  certain  bridge  facilities,  which  were  subsequently  contributed  to  the  Operating  Partnership.  The  OperatingPartnership repaid the br
idge facilities with a combination of cash on hand and a draw down on its revolving credit facility, which it subsequently refinanced with proceedsfrom
 the offering of its 4.5% senior notes due 2026. Pursuant to an amendment to the master lease, MGP, through the landlord, leased back the real property of Borgata tothe
 tenant  and  as  a  result,  initial  rent  payments  to  MGP  increased  by  $100  million,  prorated  for  the  remainder  of  the  first  lease  year  after  the  Borgata  transaction.Consistent with the master l
ease terms, 90% of this rent is fixed and will contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022. 
Resort
Operations
 
General
 
Our
 casino resorts offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. We believe we own or invest in several of the finestcasino resorts in
 the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. We make significant investments in our resorts through newlyremodeled
 hotel  rooms,  restaurants,  entertainment  and  nightlife  offerings,  as  well  as  other  new  features  and  amenities.  Most  of  our  revenue  is  cash-based,  throughcustomers
 wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow tofund capital expenditur
es, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments and repay debt financings. 
We
 believe  we operate  the highest  quality resorts  in each  of the markets  in which we operate.  Ensuring our resorts are  the premier  resorts in their respectivemarkets
 requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests. The quality of our resorts and amenities can be measured by our success inwinning
 numerous awards, both domestic and globally, including several Four and Five Diamond designations from the American Automobile Association as well asmultiple Four and Five Star design
ations from Forbes Travel Guide. 
Our results
 of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of majorconventions,
 the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Yearand
 Chinese New Year. While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant portion of our operating income is generated from high-end gamingcustomers,
 which can cause variability in our results. In addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health ofcustomer segments such as busin
ess travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results. 
2

 Al 
l of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Grand Victoria which operates 22 hours a day, every day of the year.At our domestic resorts, our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. 
Other resort amenities may be owned  and operated by us, owned by us butmanaged by
 third parties for a fee, or leased to third parties. We utilize third-party management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs. We leasespace to 
retail and food and bever age operators, particularly for branding opportunities and when capital investment by us is not desirable or feasible.

 Domestic

resorts.
Over  half  of  the  net  revenue  from  our  domestic  resorts  is derived  from  non-gaming  operations,  including  hotel,  food  and  beverage,entertainment
 and other non-gaming amenities. We market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximizehotel
 occupancy an d  customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts,which in turn affects the p
rice we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities. 
Our
 casino operations feature a variety of slots, table games, and race and sports book wagering. In addition, we offer our premium players access to high-limitrooms and lounge experiences whe
re players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere. 
MGM
China.
We acquired  an additional 4.95% interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (“MGM China”) on September 1, 2016, which increased our ownershipto
 approximately 56%. We have a controlling interest in MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”), the Macau company that ownsand
 operates the MGM Macau resort and casino and the related gaming subconcession and land concession. We believe our ownership interest in MGM China plays animportant
 role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Macau is the world’s largest gaming destination in terms of revenueand we expect future growth in th
e Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and our future property on the Cotai Strip. 
Our current
 MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and the development of MGM Cotai, discussed further below. Revenues at MGM Macau are generatedprimarily
 from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by MGM Grand Paradise. The Macau government has granted three gamingconcessions
 and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was granted by Sociedade de Jogos deMacau,
 S.A., and expires in 2020. The Macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions, but does not place a limit on the number ofcasinos or gaming areas ope
rated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires, though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations. 
In October
 2012, MGM Grand Paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of Macau to develop MGMCotai
 on an approximately 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip. The land concession contract became effective when the Macau government published the agreement in theOfficial
 Gazette of Macau on January 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years. Under the terms of the land concession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is required tobuild and open MGM Cotai by January 2018.
 
Construction of MGM Cotai commenced 
in 2013 and it is expected to open in the second half of 2017. China State Construction Engineering Corporation serves asthe
 sole general contractor for the project. MGM Cotai will be an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort with capacity for up to 500 gaming tables and up to1,500
 slots, and featuring approximately 1,500 hotel rooms. The actual number of gaming tables allocated to MGM Cotai will be determined by the Macau governmentprior
 to opening, and such allocation is expected to be less than our 500 gaming table capacity. The total estimated project budget is $3.3 billion, excluding developmentfees eliminated in consolidati
on, capitalized interest and land related costs. 
Customers
and
Competition
 
Our
 casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets weoperate
 in, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete to a lesserextent with state-sponsored 
lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States and internationally. 
Our primary methods of success
ful competition include: 
 
• Locating our resorts in desi rable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets; 
• Constructing  and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention facilities and premier dining,entertainment, retail and other ame
nities; 
• Recruiting, training and r etaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service; 
• Providing unique, “must-see” en tertainment attractions; and 
• Developing distinctive and m emorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs. 
Domestic

resorts.
Our  customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, includingconventions,
 trade associations, and small meetings. We have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater toleisure
 and value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resortsduring mid-week and off-peak p
eriods.4

  
Our Las
 Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or near theLas
 Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewhere inthe
 Las  Vegas  area.  Our  Las  Vegas  Strip  resorts  also  compete,  in  part,  with  each  other.  According  to  the  Las  Vegas  Convention  and  Visitors  Authority,  there  wereapproximately
 149,300 and 149,200 guestrooms in Las Vegas at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we operated approximately 27% ofthe
 guestrooms in Las Vegas. Las Vegas visitor volume was 42.9 million in 2016, a 1.5% increase from the 42.3 million reported for 2015. Major competitors, includingnew
 entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth ofgaming in areas outside Las Veg
as has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas. 
Outside Nevada,
 our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where locationis
 a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region. For example, inDetroit,
 Michigan we compete with a casino in nearby Windsor, Canada and with Native American casinos in Michigan. In Atlantic City, New Jersey we compete withother
 Atlantic  City  casinos  as  well  as  casinos  in  Pennsylvania  and  Maryland.  In  Washington,  D.C.  we  compete  with  other  Maryland  casinos  as  well  as  casinos  inPennsylvania
 and New Jersey. In Biloxi and Tunica, Mississippi we compete with regional riverboat and land-based casinos in Louisiana, Native American casinos incentral Mississippi and with 
casinos in Florida and the Bahamas. 
MGM

China.
The  three  primary  customer  segments  in  the  Macau  gaming  market  are  VIP  casino  gaming  operations,  main  floor  gaming  operations  and  slotmachine
 operations. VIP gaming play is sourced both internally and externally. Externally sourced VIP gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters whooffer
 VIP players various services, such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel, food and beverage services. Gaming promoters operate VIP gaming roomswithin
 the property. In exchange for their services, gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover basedcommissions.
 In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. These clientele are acquired through our directmarketing
 efforts.  Unlike  gaming  promoters  and  in-house  VIP  players,  main  floor  players  do  not  receive  commissions.  The  profit  contribution  from  the  main  floorsegment
 exceeds the VIP segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. Gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recentyears
 and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future. To target premium main floor players in order to grow revenue andimprove
 yield, we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which include both table games and slots, to the mainfloor gaming area. The a
menities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players.   
Our key competitors in Macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconce
ssionaires. If the Macau government were to grant additional concessions orsubconcessions,
 we  would  face  additional  competition  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  or  cash  flows.Additionally,
 we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations, primarily on the Cotai Strip, with severalopenings having occurred during 2016 and 
additional openings expected during 2017. 
We
 encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world, including Singapore, Korea, Australia, New Zealand,Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, 
the Philippines, Russia, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region. 
Corporate

and
other.
Much  like our domestic resorts, our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities, the value of the experience offeredto guests and the location of 
their resorts. Aria, which we manage and own 50% through CityCenter, appeals to the upper end of each segment in the Las Vegas market andcompetes
 with our domestic casino resorts and other resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. Grand Victoria, our other unconsolidated affiliate, mainly competes for customersagainst casino resorts in 
the Chicago metropolitan market. 
Marketing
 
Our
 marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs as discussed further below. We advertise on radio, television, internetand
 billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the use of socialmedia.
 We also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities. A key element of marketing to premium gaming customers ispersonal

MGM
China.
In  January 2017, MGM Macau launched M life Rewards with a focus on non-gaming rewards to cater to an increasing number of resort and leisurecustomers
 expected with the opening of the MGM Cotai property. For customers who are primarily focused on gaming, the Golden Lion Club will continue to providebenefits
 to a range of members from lower spending through the highest level VIP cash players. The structured rewards systems based on member value and tier levelensures
 that customers can progressively access the full range of services that the resort provides. Both programs, M life Rewards and Golden Lion Club, which was usedprior
 to the launch of M life Rewards, are aspirational by design and uniquely focus on building a rewarding relationship with our customers, encouraging members toincrease
 both visitation and spend. Information from the Golden Lion Club is used to analyze customer usage by segment and individual player profile. MGM Macau hasinvested in the leading
 mobile, customer relationship management and call center technologies to ensure that all customers get great experiences and rewards. 
In addition to the
 M life program, MGM Macau has also created and continues to expand several luxurious private gaming salons that provide distinctive, high-endenvironments
 for the VIP players brought to the resort through gaming promoters and the in-house VIP marketing team. MGM Macau has created a variety of incentiveprograms to reward gaming pro
moters for increased business and efficiency.

We utilize various typ
es of technology to maximize revenue, drive efficiency in our operations, and serve our customers more effectively. We continue to automateour IT operations
 to shift costs related to operation to spend on innovation. We also are implementing leading technology solutions for all MGM major lines of businesses.We
 utilize data and analytics to help us make timely and accurate business decisions. We have adopted cloud first strategy to use the cloud when possible to increase ouragility and speed to mark
et. 
We

 Employees
and
Man
agement  
We
 believe  that  knowledgeable,  friendly  and  dedicated  employees  are  a  primary  success  factor  in  the  hospitality  industry.  Therefore,  we  invest  heavily  inrecruiting,
 training,  motivating  and  retaining  exceptional  employees,  and  we  seek  to  hire  and  promote  the  strongest  management  team  possible.  We  have  numerousprograms,
 both at the corporate and business unit level, designed to achieve these objectives. We believe our internal development programs, such as the MGM ResortsUniversity and various leade
rship and management training programs, are best in class among our industry peers. 
Corporate
Social
Responsibility
 
We
 seek to conduct our business in an effective, socially responsible way which we regard as essential to maximizing shareholder value. Our corporate socialresponsibility efforts 
are overseen by the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors.   
Diversity

and
inclusion.
Diversity  and  inclusion  are  fundamental  to  our  Company’s  value  system,  our  people  philosophy,  our  cultural  life  and  therefore,  ourcompetitive
 advantage  as  an  employer  and  destination  of  choice  for  our  global  customer  base.  Our  diversity  initiative  at  our  resorts  fosters  employee  engagement,individual responsibility, team collaboration, leadership competency, high
 performance and innovation. Our diversity initiative has been widely recognized for many yearsthrough numerous awards and accol
ades. 
Philanthropy
and

community
engagement.
Our  host community and social investments are prioritized to strengthen the communities where our employees live,work
 and care for their families. Our community platform features three main programs: our Corporate Giving Program, our employee-funded MGM Resorts Foundationand
 our Employee Volunteer Program. Through these channels, we make financial and in-kind donations, contribute volunteer service and participate in civic and non-profit
 organizations and issues that advance the quality of life in our communities. Key investment areas include hunger relief, diversity, public education, health andwellness and environmental sus
tainability. 
Environmental

sustainability.
We  continue to gain recognition for our comprehensive environmental responsibility initiatives in energy and water conservation,recycling
 and waste management, sustainable supply chain and green building. Certain of our casino resorts in Nevada and our casino resort in Michigan were the first ineach
 state  to  earn  certification  from  Green  Key,  the  largest  international  program  evaluating  sustainable  hotel  operations.  We  received  certifications  at  most  of  ourdomestic
 resorts and Aria and Vdara at CityCenter. Aria, Vdara, Bellagio and Mandalay Bay have all received “Five Green Key,” the highest possible rating. Many majortravel service provid
ers recognize the Green Key designation and identify our resorts for their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations.  
In
 addition,  we  believe  that  incorporating  the  tenets  of  sustainability  in  our  business  decisions  advances  a  platform  for  innovation  and  operational  efficiency.CityCenter
 (Aria, Vdara, Veer and Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas) is one of the world’s largest private sustainable developments. With six LEED ® Gold certificationsfrom
 the U.S. Green Building Council (the “Council”), CityCenter serves as the standard for combining luxury and environmental responsibility within the large-scalehospitality industry. Also, MGM National Ha
rbor, The Park, and T-Mobile Arena have all been awarded LEED ® Gold certification by the Council. 
At
 MGM  China,  we  incorporate  the  same  commitment  to  environmental  preservation.  Our  efforts  to  improve  energy  efficiency,  indoor  air  quality,  andenvironmental
 stewardship have resulted in MGM China being included in the Hang Seng Sustainability Index on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and MGM Cotai, ournew
 integrated resort scheduled to open in the second half of 2017 achieving the China Green Building (Macau) Design label from the China Green Building and EnergySaving (Macau) Association.
 
The
 construction of MGM Springfield will further position MGM Resorts as a leader in sustainable resort operations, and by adopting innovative technologies inthe design and operating pra
ctices of this resort, we are advancing our commitment to protecting our planet in new regions. 
Development
and
Leveraging
Our
Brand
and
Management
Assets
 
In allocating resourc
es, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts, spending on new resorts and other developmentsor
 initiatives  and  repaying  long-term  debt.  We  believe  there  are  reasonable  investments  for  us  to  make  in  new  initiatives  and  at  our  current  resorts  that  will  provideprofitable returns.
 
We
 regularly  evaluate  possible  expansion  and  acquisition  opportunities  in  domestic  and  international  markets.  Opportunities  we  evaluate  may  include  theownership, management
 and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada, or in states other than Nevada, or outside of the United States. We leverageour management expert
ise and well-recognized brands through7

 strategic
 partnerships  and  international  expansion  opportunities.  We  feel  that  several  of  our  brands  are  well-suited  to  new  projects  in  both  gaming  and  non-gamingdevelopments. We may under
take these opportunities either alone o r in cooperation with one or mo re third parties. 
MGM
Springfield
 
A
 subsidiary of ours was awarded a casino license to build and operate MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts. MGM Springfield will be developed onapproximately
 14 acres of land in downtown Springfield. Plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 3,000 slots and 100 table games includingpoker;
 a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 3,375-space parking garage, with anexpected
 development and construction cost of approximately $865 million, excluding capitalized interest and land related costs. Construction of MGM Springfield isexpected to be complet
ed in late 2018. 
Intellectual
Property
 
Our
 principal  intellectual  property  consists  of  trademarks  for,  among  others,  Bellagio,  The  Mirage,  Borgata  (following  the  acquisition  of  Boyd  Gaming’sownership
 interest  in  Borgata),  Mandalay  Bay,  MGM,  MGM  Grand,  MGM  Resorts  International,  Luxor,  Excalibur,  New  York-New  York,  Circus  Circus  and  BeauRivage,
 all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes in the United States. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous othertrademarks
 in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks arebrand
 names under which we market our properties and services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developingbrand
 identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademarkregistrations
 are of perpetual duration so long as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent withour goals for brand developmen
t and identification, and enforcement of our trademark rights.
Employees
and
Labor
Relations
 
As
 of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 52,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time employees domestically, of which 6,000 and 2,000, respectively, supportthe
 Company’s management agreements with CityCenter. In addition, we had approximately 6,000 employees at MGM Macau. We had collective bargaining agreementswith
 unions covering approximately 34,000 of our employees as of December 31, 2016. No collective bargaining agreements covering sizable numbers of our employeesare
 scheduled to expire in 2017. In 2016 and early 2017, we entered into initial collective bargaining agreements for certain employee groups at The Mirage, Bellagio,Aria, Vdara,
 Monte Carlo and Gold Strike Tunica. Beau Rivage is currently engaged in negotiations for an initial collective bargaining agreement with a council of unionsrepresenting
 various hotel and food and beverage constituencies. Mandalay Bay is currently engaged in negotiations for an initial collective bargaining agreement for twoemployee
 groups. MGM National Harbor will begin negotiating in 2017 for initial bargaining agreements with several employee groups. As of December 31, 2016, noneof
 the employees of MGM Macau are part of a labor union and the resort is not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to begood.
 
Regulation

The
 gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations.  Each of our casinos is subject toextensive
 regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located.  These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility,financial stability and
 character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result indisciplinary action in o
ther jurisdictions.   
A
 more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which Exhibit isincorporated herein by r
eference.

 Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations to  meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by personswith
 disabilities) ,  construction,  land  use  and  marketing  and  advertising.  We  also  deal  with  significant  amounts  of  cash  in  our  operations  and  are  subject  to  variousreporting
 and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulationscould
 be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect ouroperating results.

 lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position orresults of operations;

ant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession, which is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2020; 
• our ability to build and open our d evelopment in Cotai by January 2018; 
• the dependence of MGM Macau upon gam ing promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in Macau;

f damages, lawsuits or other restrictions on our use or transfer of data; 
• increases in gaming tax es and fees in the jurisdictions in which we operate; and 
• the  potential for conflicts of interest to arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of MGM China, which is now a publicly tradedcompany listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

 ITEM
1A.
RISK
FACTORS  
You should be aware that
 the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the SEC couldhave a material
 adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among other things,the risks described below.

Risks
Relating
to
Our
Substantial
Indebtedness

 
• Our
substantial
indebtedness
and
significant
financial
commitments,
including
the
fixed
component
of
our
rent
payments
to
MGP,
could
adversely
affect
ouroperations

and
financial
results
and
impact
our
ability
to
satisfy
our
obligations
.  Our  substantial  indebtedness  and  significant  financial  commitments,including
 the fixed component of our rent payments to MGP, could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy ourobligations.
 As  of  December  31,  2016,  we  had  approximately  $13.1  billion  principal  amount  of  indebtedness  outstanding,  including  $250  million  ofborrowings
 outstanding  and  $1.2  billion  of  available  borrowing  capacity  under  our  senior  secured  credit  facility,  and  $1.9  billion,  $2.1  billion  and  $450million
 of  debt  outstanding  under  the  MGM  China,  Operating  Partnership,  and  MGM  National  Harbor  credit  facilities,  respectively.  In  addition,  theOperating
 Partnership has $1.55 billion of senior notes outstanding. Any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings wouldincrease
 the  cost  of  our  indebtedness  and  reduce  the  cash  flow  available  to  fund  our  other  liquidity  needs.  We  do  not  guarantee  MGM  China’s,  MGMNational
 Harbor’s or the Operating Partnership’s obligations under their respective debt agreements and, to the extent MGM Macau, MGM National Harboror
 the Operating Partnership were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service their indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into suchentities is limit
ed by the covenants in our existing senior secured credit facility. 
In addition, our substantial 
indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including: 
 
• increasing our exposure to gen eral adverse economic and industry conditions; 
• limiting our flexibi lity to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; 
• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; 
• making it more diffi cult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or 
• placing us at a competitive  disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors. 
Moreover,
 our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned, leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically investsignificant
 capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished (and, under the master lease we are required to spend an aggregateamount
 of at least 1% of actual adjusted net revenues from the properties included under the master lease on capital expenditures at those properties). Suchinvestment
 requires  an  ongoing  supply  of  cash  and,  to  the  extent  that  we  cannot  fund  expenditures  from  cash  generated  by  operations,  funds  must  beborrowed
 or  otherwise  obtained.  Similarly,  development  projects,  including  our  development  project  in  Massachusetts,  and  acquisitions  could  requiresignificant
 capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt, or the incurrence of contingent liabilities, any or all ofwhich could have an adverse ef
fect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

conditions
could
adversely
affect
our

.  Our  ability  to  make  payments  on,  and  to  refinance,  our  indebtedness  and  to  fund  planned  or  committed  capital  expenditures  andinvestments
 depends  on  our  ability  to  generate  cash  flow  in  the  future,  receive  distributions  from  our  unconsolidated  affiliates  or  subsidiaries,  includingMGM
 China and the Operating Partnership, borrow under our senior secured credit facility or incur new indebtedness. If regional and national economicconditions
 deteriorate we could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and could fail togenerate
 sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments. We cannot assureyou
 that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, continue to receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries,including
 MGM China and the Operating Partnership, that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amountsufficient to
 enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrowadditional indebtedness on t
erms that are favorable to us. 
We have a
 significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2018, and thereafter. Our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in the future willdepend
 upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis, we might beforced to seek altern
ate forms of financing, dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments. There is no assurance that any ofthese alternatives

 would be
 available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or on terms that would not require us to breach theterms and conditions of 
our existing or future debt agreements.

• pay dividends or distributions, r epurchase or issue equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments; 
• incur additional debt;  
• incur liens on assets;  
• sell assets or consolidat e with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets; 
• enter into transact ions with affiliates; 
• allow certain subsidiaries  to transfer assets; and 
• enter into sale and le ase-back transactions. 
Our
 ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. The breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwisewaived
 or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could triggercross-defaults
 under  other  agreements  governing  our  long-term  indebtedness.  In  addition,  our  senior  secured  credit  facility  requires  us  to  satisfy  certainfinancial
 covenants, including  a  maximum  total net leverage  ratio, a maximum first lien net leverage  ratio and a minimum interest  coverage ratio. Any default
 under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, ourresults of operations and our 
ability to make payments on our debt. 
In
 addition, MGM Grand Paradise and MGM China are co-borrowers under an amended and restated credit facility and the Operating Partnership and MGMNational
 Harbor, LLC are each borrowers under their respective senior secured credit facilities, all of which contain covenants that restrict the respectiveborrower’s ability to engage
 in certain transactions. In particular, these credit agreements require MGM China, the Operating Partnership and MGM NationalHarbor,
 LLC to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certain operating and financial restrictions on MGM China, the Operating Partnership andMGM
 National Harbor, LLC, and each of their subsidiaries (including, with respect to MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise), respectively. These restrictionsinclude,
 among other things, limitations on their ability to pay dividends or distributions to us, incur additional debt, make investments or engage in otherbusinesses, merge or consolida

. We  are required to pay annualrent
 of $650 million, which increased from $550 million as a result of the Borgata transaction on August 1, 2016 (with annual escalators of 2% in the secondthrough
 sixth years of the master lease and the possibility for additional 2% increases thereafter, as well as potential increases in percentage rent every fiveyears), to
 MGP pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the master lease. As a result, our ability to fund our own operations, raise capital, makeacquisitions,
 make investments, service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. For example, ourobligations under the mast
er lease may: 
 
• make it more diffi cult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;  
• increase our vulnerabi lity to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business; 
• require  us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making rent payments, thereby reducing the availability ofour cash flow to fund working capita
l, capital expenditures, development projects and other general corporate purposes; 
• limit our flexibil ity in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;  
• restrict our ability to make ac quisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and 
• cause  us to lose our rights with respect to all of the properties leased under the master lease if we fail to pay rent or other amounts orotherwise
 default on the master lease, given that all of the properties we lease from MGP under the master lease are effectively cross-collateralized as a result of the
 master lease being a single unitary lease.

 Any of the above factors could hav

Business
 
 
• We
face
significant
competition
with
respect

destination
travel
locations
generally
and
with
respect
to
our
peers
in
the
industries
in
which

compete,
andfailure

to
compete
effectively
could
materially
adversely
affect
our
business,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations
and
cash
flow
.  The hotel, resort andcasino
 industries  are  highly  competitive.  We  do not  believe  that  our competition  is limited  to a  particular  geographic  area,  and  hotel,  resort  and gamingoperations
 in other states or countries could attract our customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded byothers
 in  major  destination  locations,  competition  will  increase.  Major  competitors,  including  potential  new  entrants,  may  also  expand  their  hotel  roomcapacity, expand
 their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas, Macau or in the domestic regional markets inwhich
 we operate, all of which could attract our customers. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas, including California, has increased thecompetition faced by our op
erations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. 
In
 addition,  competition  could  increase  if  changes  in  gaming  restrictions  in  the  United  States  and  elsewhere  result  in  the  addition  of  new  gamingestablishments
 located closer to our customers than our casinos, such as has happened in California. For example, while our Macau operations compete tosome
 extent  with  casinos  located  elsewhere  in  or  near  Asia  (including  Singapore,  Korea,  Australia,  New  Zealand,  Malaysia,  Vietnam,  Cambodia,  thePhilippines,
 Russia, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and unlicensed gaming operations), certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming(including
 Japan)  and others  (such  as  Taiwan  and Thailand)  may  legalize  casino  gaming  (or online  gaming)  in  the  future.  Furthermore,  currently  MGMGrand
 Paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the Macau government to operate casinos in Macau. If the Macau government wereto
 allow additional competitors to operate in Macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires openadditional facilities (for example, the facilities currently being developed in Cotai, Macau are expected to increase total hotel room inventory by 10% through
2018 and significantly incr
ease other gaming and non-gaming offerings in Macau), we would face increased competition.   
Most
 jurisdictions  where  casino  gaming  is  currently  permitted  place  numerical  and/or  geographical  limitations  on  the  issuance  of  new  gaming  licenses.Although
 a number of jurisdictions in the United States and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some cases newgaming
 operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities (whichmay include
 acquisitions of existing properties) that do arise. Furthermore, certain jurisdictions, including Nevada and New Jersey, have also legalized formsof
 online  gaming  and  other  jurisdictions,  including  Illinois,  have  legalized  video  gaming  terminals.  The  expansion  of  online  gaming  and  other  types  ofgaming in these and other ju
risdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts. 
In
 addition to competition with other hotels, resorts and casinos, we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate.Our
 failure  to  compete  successfully  in  our  various  markets  and  to  continue  to  attract  customers  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,results of operations and c
ash flow. 
 
• Our
businesses
are
subject
to
extensive
regulation
and
the
cost
of
compliance
or
failure
to
comply
with
such
regulations
may
adversely
affect
our
businessand

results
of
operations
.  Our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries, states and provinces in whichwe
 operate.  These  laws,  regulations  and  ordinances  vary  from  jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction,  but  generally  concern  the  responsibility,  financial  stability  andcharacter
 of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. As such, our gamingregulators
 can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or, alternatively, cease operations inthat
 jurisdiction.  In  addition,  unsuitable  activity  on  our  part  or  on  the  part  of  our  domestic  or  foreign  unconsolidated  affiliates  or  subsidiaries  in  anyjurisdiction
 could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. The regulatory environment in any particular jurisdictionmay change
 in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to various gamingtaxes,
 which are subject to possible increase at any time by various federal, state, local and foreign legislatures and officials. Increases in gaming taxationcould
 also  adversely  affect  our  results.  For  a  summary  of  gaming  and  other  regulations  that  affect  our  business,  see  “Regulation  and  Licensing”  andExhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Further, our directors, off
icers, key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities.If state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuita
ble, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investormay be required to dispose of h
is, her or its interest in14

 the
 property. State regulatory a gencies  may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors, officers, key employees or investors toensure
 compliance with applicable standards. Certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions also requir e  the approval of certainregulatory authorities.
 
In
 Macau, current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are, for the most part, fairly recent and there is little precedent on theinterpretation
 of these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the futurerender an interpretation of
 these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from MGM China’s interpretation, which could have amaterial
 adverse  effect  on  its  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  In  addition,  MGM  China’s  activities  in  Macau  are  subject  toadministrative
 review and approval by various government agencies. We cannot assure you that MGM China will be able to obtain all necessary approvals,and
 any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations. Macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect toadministrative ac
tions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues. 
In
 addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. Theselaws
 and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking, employees,currency
 transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. For instance, we are subject to certain federal, state and localenvironmental
 laws,  regulations  and  ordinances,  including  the  Clean  Air  Act,  the  Clean  Water  Act,  the  Resource  Conservation  Recovery  Act,  theComprehensive
 Environmental  Response,  Compensation  and  Liability  Act  and  the  Oil  Pollution  Act  of  1990.  Under  various  federal,  state  and  localenvironmental
 laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous ortoxic
 substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence ofsuch
 substances or wastes. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could beenacted.
 For  example,  Illinois  has  enacted  a  ban  on  smoking  in  nearly  all  public  places,  including  bars,  restaurants,  work  places,  schools  and  casinos.Similarly,
 in October 2014, casinos in Macau, including MGM China, implemented a smoking ban which prohibits smoking on all mass market gamingfloors and, in 2015, the Macau Health Bureau
 announced that they will promote the submission of a bill proposing a full smoking ban in casinos, including inVIP rooms. The likelihood or outcome
 of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking banwould be expected to negative
ly impact our financial performance. 
We
 also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various anti-moneylaundering
 laws and regulations. For instance, we are subject to regulation under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, commonlyknown
 as the “Bank Secrecy Act"”, which, among other things, requires us to report to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) any currency transactions inexcess
 of $10,000 that occur within a 24-hour gaming day, including identification of the individual(s) involved in the currency transaction. We are alsorequired
 to report certain suspicious activity where we know, suspect or have reason to suspect transactions, among other things, involve funds from illegalactivity
 or are intended to evade  federal  regulations  or avoid reporting  requirements  or have no business or lawful  purpose. In addition, under the BankSecrecy
 Act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention. Our compliance with the Bank SecrecyAct
 is subject to periodic examinations by the IRS. Any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new lawsand
 regulations could be enacted. Any violations of the anti-money laundering laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, or regulations by any of our propertiescould have an adverse eff
ect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
• Our
business
is
affected
by
economic
and
market
conditions
in
the
markets
in
which
we
operate
and
in
the
locations
in
which
our
customers
reside
.  Ourbusiness
 is  particularly  sensitive  to  reductions  in  discretionary  consumer  spending  and  corporate  spending  on  conventions,  trade  shows  and  businessdevelopment.
 Economic  contraction,  economic  uncertainty  or  the  perception  by  our  customers  of  weak  or  weakening  economic  conditions  may  cause  adecline
 in demand for hotels, casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities we offer. In addition, changes in discretionaryconsumer
 spending  or  consumer  preferences  could  be  driven  by  factors  such  as  the  increased  cost  of  travel,  an  unstable  job  market,  perceived  or  actualdisposable consumer income 
and wealth, outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and future acts of terrorism. Consumer preferences also evolve overtime
 due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes, which, for instance, have resulted in recent growth in consumer demand for non-gamingofferings.
 Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and timely react to these trends, and any failure to do so maynegatively
 impact our results of operations. Aria, Bellagio and MGM Grand Las Vegas in particular may be affected by economic conditions in the Far East,and
 all of our Nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the United States, and California in particular. A recession, economic slowdown or anyother significant econo
mic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts,15

  
w hich  would  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  For  example,  the  prior  recession  and  downturn  in  consumer  and  corporate  spending  had  a  negativeimpact on our results of ope
rations. 
In
 addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to MGM Macau from mainland China, general economic and market conditions inChina
 could impact our financial prospects. Any slowdown in economic growth or changes to China’s current restrictions on travel and currency conversionor
 movements, including market impacts resulting from China’s recent anti-corruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by non-banklending entities and cross-border currency
 monitoring (including increased restrictions on Union Pay withdrawals and other ATM limits on the withdrawal ofpatacas imposed by the government), could disrupt
 the number of visitors from mainland China to MGM Macau and/or the amounts they are willing to spendin
 the casino. For example, from 2008 through 2010, China readjusted its visa policy toward Macau and limited the number of visits that some mainlandChinese
 citizens may make to Macau in a given time period. In addition, effective October 2013, China banned “zero‑ fare” tour groups involving no or lowup-front
 payments  and  compulsory  shopping,  which  were  popular  among  visitors  to  Macau  from  mainland  China,  and  in  December  2014  the  Chinesegovernment
 tightened the enforcement of visa transit rules for those seeking to enter Macau at the Gongbei border (including requirements to present anairplane ticket to 
a destination country, a visa issued by such destination country and a valid Chinese passport). It is unclear whether these and other measureswill
 continue to be in effect, become more restrictive, or be readopted in the future. These developments have had, and any future policy developments thatmay
 be implemented may have, the effect of reducing the number of visitors to Macau from mainland China, which could adversely impact tourism and thegaming industry in Macau.
Furthermore,
 our operations in Macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources. Our success in Macau will be impacted by our ability toretain and
 hire employees. We compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition willgrow
 in light of new developments in Macau. While we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resorts, certain Macau governmentpolicies
 limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications (for instance, the Macau government requires that we only hire Macau residents asdealers
 in our casinos) and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase. In addition,limitations
 on the number of gaming tables permitted by the Macau government could impact our current expectation on the number of table games we willbe
 able  to  utilize  at  our  Cotai  project.  Such  limitations  or  reduction  in  table  game  availability  may  impact  MGM  China’s  results  of  operations.  Finally,because additional cas
ino projects are under construction and are to be developed in the future, existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expandedto
 accommodate increased visitation to Macau. If transportation facilities to and from Macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume ofgaming customers
 visiting Macau, the desirability of Macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results of operations at our development in Cotai, Macau,could be negatively impa
cted.

In  2015, we commenced an initiative for sustained growth andmargin
 enhancement, focused on improving our business processes to optimize scale for greater efficiency and lower costs throughout our business. While we
 believe these initiatives will continue to result in Adjusted EBITDA benefit, our optimization efforts may fail to achieve expected results or we may notbe
 able to sustain our historic efforts to produce continuous improvements. In addition, while we expect to continue to explore additional opportunities todrive further improvement
 to our business processes, we may not be able to achieve the historic Adjusted EBITDA benefits at the same rate (or at all) and wemay not be able to institu
tionalize the continuous improvement business practices that developed in connection with implementing the Profit Growth Plan.

 are a holding company with no material direct operations, we are dependent on receiving cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds fromoperations necessary to
 pay dividends on our common stock. We expect our subsidiaries will continue to generate significant cash flow necessary to maintainquarterly
 dividend payments on our common stock, however, their ability to generate funds will be subject to their operating results, cash requirements andfinancial
 condition, any applicable provisions of state law that may limit the amount of funds available to us, and compliance with covenants and financialratios
 related to existing or future agreements governing any indebtedness at such subsidiaries and any limitations in other agreements such subsidiaries mayhave with
 third parties. In addition, each of the companies in our corporate chain must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all oftheir respective cash obligations. As
 a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, future dividend payments may be reduced or eliminated. Anychange in the level of our d
ividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

 We  lease ten of our destination resorts and The Park from a subsidiary of MGP pursuant to the master lease. The master lease has aterm of ten years with up to 
four additional five year extensions, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The master lease is commonly known as a triple-net lease. Accordingly, in addition
 to rent, we are required to pay the following, among other things: (1) all facility maintena nce, (2) all insurance required inconnection
 with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (otherthan
 taxes on the income of the lessor), (4) all capital expen ditures,  and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased propertiesand
 the business conducted on the leased properties. We are responsible for paying for these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange
 for such costs shall accrue in part to MGP as owner of the associated facilities. In addition, if some of our leased facilities should prove tobe
 unprofitable or experience other issues that would warrant ceasing operations or if we sho uld  otherwise decide to exit a particular property, we wouldremain
 obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the master lease even if we decided to cease operations at those locations unless we are ableto
 transfer the rights with respect t o  a particular property in accordance with the requirements of the master lease. Our ability to transfer our obligationsunder
 the master lease to a third-party with respect to individual properties, should we decide to withdraw from a particular location,  is  limited to non-LasVegas
 properties and no more than two Las Vegas gaming properties and is subject to identifying a willing third-party who meets the requirements for atransferee
 set forth in the master lease. We may be unable to find an appropriate  transferee  willing   to assume the obligations under the master lease withrespect
 to  any  such  property.  In  addition,  we  could  incur  special  charges  relating  to  the  closing  of  such  facilities  including  sublease  termination  costs,impairment
 charges and other special  charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionand
 results  of  operations.  Furthermore,  our  obligation  to  pay  rent  as  well  as  the  other  costs  described  above  is  absolute  in  vir tually  all circumstances,regardless of the performance of the

 any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP and which represents a majority of the votingpower

 and its subsidiaries ),  on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action by MGP’s board ofdirectors in respect
 of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to MGP if it is (i) app roved by a majority of a con flictscommittee which consists solely
 of “independent” directors (which MGP refers to as “Special Approval”) (such independence determined in accordance withthe
 NYSE’s listing standards, the standards established by the Exchan ge  Act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additionalindependence
 requirements in our operating agreement), (ii) determined by MGP’s board of directors to be fair and reasonable to MGP or (iii) approved bythe
 affirmative vo te  of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by us andour
 affiliates). Furthermore, that MGP’s operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value, individually o r  in the aggregate, over $25 millionbetween
 us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand (any suchtransaction
 (other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our  affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries) under any of the material agreements enteredinto
 on the closing day of MGP’s formation transactions), a “Threshold Transaction”), shall be permitted only if (i) Special Approval is obtained or (ii) suchtransaction is approved by the affirmative
 vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excluding votingshares owned by us and our affilia

As
 a result, certain transactions, including any Threshold Transactions that we may want to pursue with MGP and that could have significant benefit to usmay require
 Special Approval. There can be no assurance that the required approval will be obtained with respect to these transactions either from a conflictscommittee
 comprised of independent MGP directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates. The failure to obtainsuch requisite consent
 could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives.

.  The Macau government hasthe
 right to unilaterally terminate the subconcession in the event of fundamental non-compliance by MGM Grand Paradise with applicable Macau laws orMGM
 Grand Paradise’s basic obligations under the subconcession contract. MGM Grand Paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such non-compliancewith
 its fundamental obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the Macau government. Upon such termination, all ofMGM
 Grand  Paradise’s  casino  area  premises  and  gaming-related  equipment  would  be  transferred  automatically  to  the  Macau  government  withoutcompensation
 to  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  and  we  would  cease  to  generate  any  revenues  from  these  operations.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  MGM  GrandParadise will perform a
ll of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the Macau government. 
Furthermore,
 under  the  subconcession  contract,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  obligated  to  comply  with  any  laws  and  regulations  that  the  Macau  governmentmight
 promulgate in the future. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these lawsand
 regulations  would  not  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  construct  or  operate  our  Macau  businesses.  If  any  disagreement  arises  between  MGM  GrandParadise
 and the Macau government regarding the interpretation of, or MGM Grand Paradise’s compliance with, a provision of the subconcession contract,MGM
 Grand Paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the Macau government. During any consultation or negotiation, MGMGrand
 Paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the Macau government. Currently, there is noprecedent
 concerning  how  the  Macau  government  will  treat  the  termination  of  a  concession  or  subconcession  upon  the  occurrence  of  any  of  thecircumstances
 mentioned  above.  The  loss  of  the  subconcession  would  require  us  to  cease  conducting  gaming  operations  in  Macau,  which  would  have  amaterial adverse 
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 In
 addition, the subconcession contract expires on March 31, 2020. Unless the subconcession is extended, or legislation with regard to reversion of casinopremises
 is  amended,  all  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s casino  premises  and  gaming-related  equipment  will  automatically  be  transferred  to  the  Macaugovernment on
 that date without compensation to us, and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. Beginning on April 20, 2017,the Macau g 
overnment may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice. In the event the Macau government exercises this
 redemption  right,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  entitled  to  fair  compensation  or  indemnity.  The  amount  of  such  compen sation  or  indemnity  will  bedetermined
 based on the amount of gaming and non-gaming revenue generated by MGM Grand Paradise, excluding the convention and exhibition facilities,during the taxable year
 prior to the redemption, before deducting interest, dep reciation and amortization, multiplied  by the number of remaining years beforeexpiration
 of  the  subconcession.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  be  able  to  renew  or  extend  the  subconcession  contract  on  termsfavorable to MGM Grand Paradise 
or at all. We also canno t assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed, the compensation paid to MGM Grand Paradisewill be adequate to compens

• MGM
Grand
Paradise
is
dependent
upon
gaming
promoters
for
a
significant
portion
of
gaming
revenues
in
Macau
.  Gaming  promoters,  who  promotegaming and draw high-end customers to casinos
, are responsible for a significant portion of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming revenues in Macau. With the risein
 gaming in Macau and the recent reduction in the number of licensed gaming promoters in Macau and in the number of VIP rooms operated by licensedgaming
 promoters,  the  competition  for  relationships  with  gaming  promoters  has  increased.  While  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  undertaking  initiatives  tostrengthen
 relationships with gaming promoters, there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain, or grow, relationships with gaming promoters. Inaddition,
 continued reductions in, and new regulations governing, the gaming promoter segment may result in the closure of additional VIP rooms in Macau,including
 VIP rooms at MGM Macau. If MGM Grand Paradise is unable to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters, or if gaming promotersare
 unable  to  develop  or  maintain  relationships  with  our  high-end  customers  (or  if,  as  a  result  of  recent  market  conditions  in  Macau,  gaming  promotersencounter
 difficulties attracting patrons to come to Macau or experience decreased liquidity limiting their ability to grant credit to patrons), MGM GrandParadise’s
 ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered. Furthermore, if existing VIP rooms at MGM Macau are closed there can be no assurance thatMGM Grand Paradise will be able to lo
cate acceptable gaming promoters to run such VIP rooms in the future in a timely manner, or at all. 
In
 addition, the quality of gaming promoters is important to MGM Grand Paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance withgaming
 licenses. While MGM Grand Paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters, we cannot assure you that the gaming promoterswith
 whom  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  or  becomes  associated  will  meet  the  high  standards  insisted  upon.  If  a  gaming  promoter  falls  below  MGM  GrandParadise’s
 standards,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  or  we  may  suffer  reputational  harm  or  possibly  sanctions  from  gaming  regulators  with  authority  over  ouroperations.
 
We
 also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance  of those gaming promoters may impact therecoverability of th
ese loans. 
 
• The
future
recognition
of
our
foreign
tax
credit
deferred
tax
asset
is
uncertain,
and
the
amount
of
valuation
allowance
we
may
apply
against
such
deferredtax

asset
may
change
materially
in
future
periods.
We  currently have significant foreign tax credit deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwardsthat are
 available to reduce potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods. We evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverabilityand
 record a valuation allowance to the extent that we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered. This evaluation is based on allavailable
 evidence,  including  assumptions  about  operating  profits  in  the  U.S.  and  abroad.  As  a  result,  significant  judgment  is  required  in  assessing  thepossible
 need  for  a  deferred  tax  asset  valuation  allowance  and  changes  to  our  assumptions  may  have  a  material  impact  on  the  amount  of  the  valuationallowance.
 For example, a change to our forecasts of future profitability of and distributions from MGM China or a change in our assumptions concerningfuture
 U.S. operating profits could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes insuch period. In addition, a renewal in
 a future period of the exemption from Macau’s 12% complementary tax on gaming profits could have a material impacton the provision for income t
axes in such period.19

  
Finally,  changes in U.S. tax law under consideration as part of broader corporate tax reform, namely a change from a worldwide to a territo rial  tax system,could
 eliminate our ability to utilize some portion or all of our foreign tax credits in future periods and such change could result in a material change in thevaluation
 allowance, or elimination of the foreign tax credit deferred tax ass et  in its entirety, with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxesin the period of such change.
 
 
• Extreme
weather
conditions
or
climate
change
may
cause
property
damage
or
interrupt
business,
which
could
harm
our
business
and
results
of
operations
. Certain
 of our casino properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in the UnitedStates
 and  severe  typhoons  in  Macau.  Such  extreme  weather  conditions  may  interrupt  our  operations,  damage  our  properties,  and  reduce  the  number  ofcustomers
 who visit our facilities in such areas. In addition, our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage. Asevere
 drought of extensive duration experienced in Las Vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely affect our business and results ofoperations.
 Although  we  maintain  both  property  and  business  interruption  insurance  coverage  for  certain  extreme  weather  conditions,  such  coverage  issubject
 to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption, and we cannot assure you thatwe
 will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, such extremeweather
 conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefiniteperiod, which would have a mater
ial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
• Because
a
majority
of
our
major
gaming
resorts
are
concentrated
on
the
Las
Vegas
Strip,
we
are
subject
to
greater
risks
than
a
gaming
company
that
is
moregeographically
diversifi
ed
.  Given that a majority of our major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, our business may be significantly affected byrisks
 common to the Las Vegas tourism industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel toand
 from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las Vegas, but we rely on air trafficfor
 a significant portion of our visitors. Reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact the number ofvisitors
 to  our  resorts.  Additionally,  there  is  one  principal  interstate  highway  between  Las  Vegas  and  Southern  California,  where  a  large  number  of  ourcustomers reside. Capaci
ty constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities. 
 
• We
extend
credit
to
a
large
portion
of
our
customers
and
we
may
not
be
able
to
collect
gaming
receivables
. We conduct a portion of our ga ming activities ona
 credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. Table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players, andhigh-end
 players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms ofgaming,
 and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in aparticular
 quarter. Furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-end customers could have an adverse effect on ourbusiness,
 financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant,in
 the opinion of management, an extension of credit. In addition, MGM Grand Paradise extends credit to certain gaming promoters and those promoters canextend
 credit to their customers. Uncollectible receivables from high-end customers and gaming promoters could have a significant impact on our results ofoperations.
 
While
 gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and Nevada judgments ongaming debts
 are enforceable in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcementof
 gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreigndebtors may be reached to s
atisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations. 
Furthermore,
 we expect that MGM Macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To the extentMGM Macau
 gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions, MGM Macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able tocollect
 all  of  its  gaming  receivables  because,  among  other  reasons,  courts  of  many  jurisdictions  do  not  enforce  gaming  debts  and  MGM  Macau  mayencounter
 forums  that  will  refuse  to  enforce  such  debts.  Moreover,  under  applicable  law,  MGM  Macau  remains  obligated  to  pay  taxes  on  uncollectiblewinnings from customers.
 
Even
 where gaming debts are enforceable, they may not be collectible. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on ouroperating results.

 negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in write-downs
 and impairment charges in t he  past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges or write-downs may berequired
 in  future  periods.  For  instance,  in  2015,  we  recorded  a  non-cash  impairment  charge  of  $1.5  billion  to  reduce  the  historical  carryi ng  value  ofgoodwill
 related to the MGM China reporting unit. If we are required to record additional impairment charges or write-downs, this could have a materialadverse impact on our consol

 any terrorist act, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air could adversely affectour
 financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain typesof terrorist acts, insu

• Co-investing
in
our
properties,
including
our
investment
in
CityCenter,
decreases
our
ability
to
manage
risk
.  In addition to acquiring or developing hotelsand
 resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest, as a co-investor.
 Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property. Therefore, the operation of such properties is subject to inherent risk dueto
 the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters. In addition, investments with other investors may involve riskssuch
 as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or businessinterests or goals
 that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contraryto
 our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject hotels and resorts owned by such entities to additional risk. Further, wemay
 be unable to take action without the approval of our co-investors. Alternatively, our co-investors could take actions binding on the property without ourconsent. Additionally, should a co-
investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabilities. 
For instance, CityCenter, which is 50% owned and managed
 by us, has a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business and itsability
 to meet its obligations. If CityCenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our co-investor are unable to support future fundingrequirements,
 as necessary, such event could have adverse financial consequences to us. In addition, the agreements governing CityCenter’s indebtednesssubject
 CityCenter  and  its  subsidiaries  to  significant  financial  and  other  restrictive  covenants,  including  restrictions  on  its  ability  to  incur  additionalindebtedness,
 place  liens  upon  assets,  make  distributions  to  us,  make  certain  investments,  consummate  certain  asset  sales,  enter  into  transactions  withaffiliates
 (including us) and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially allof
 its  assets.  The  CityCenter  third  amended  and  restated  credit  facility  also  includes  certain  financial  covenants  that  require  CityCenter  to  maintain  amaximum
 total leverage ratio (as defined in CityCenter’s third amended and restated credit facility) for each quarter. We cannot be sure that CityCenter willbe able to meet this test i
n the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test.

• changes to plans and specifi cations; 
• engineering problems, inc luding defective plans and specifications; 
• shortages of, and price inc reases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor, and inflation in key supply markets; 
• delays in obtaining or inabi lity to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals; 
• changes  in  laws  and  regulations,  or  in  the  interpretation  and  enforcement  of  laws  and  regulations,  applicable  to  gaming,  leisure,residential, real

• weather interferen ces or delays; 
• fires, typhoons and other natur al disasters; 
• geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and 
• other unanticipated circumstance s or cost increases. 
The
 occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs, delay or prevent the construction, development, expansionor
 opening  or  otherwise  affect  the  design  and  features  of  any  future  projects  which  we  might  undertake.  For  instance,  we  currently  expect  the  totaldevelopment
 costs of our Cotai project to be approximately $3.3 billion, excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest andland-related
 costs, and we currently expect total development costs of our Massachusetts project to be approximately $865 million, excluding capitalizedinterest
 and land-related costs. While we believe that the overall budgets for these developments are reasonable, these development costs are estimates andthe actual development costs may be higher than expected. We cannot guarantee that our construction costs or total project cost
s for future projects, includingour
 developments in Cotai and Massachusetts, will not increase beyond amounts initially budgeted or that the expected design and features of current orfuture projects will not change. In addition, the regulatory approvals as
sociated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts bya
 certain  specified  time  and  to  the  extent  we  are  unable  to  meet  those  deadlines,  and  any  such  deadlines  are  not  extended,  we  may  lose  our  regulatoryapproval
 to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect onour results of operations and 
financial condition.

. Although  we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating properties,which
 covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism), each policy has certain exclusions. In addition, ourproperty
 insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a totalloss. Our level of insurance coverage also may not be adeq

 strikes; nuclear events; acts of war; loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism; loss of electricalpower due to
 catastrophic events, rolling blackouts or otherwise; deterioration or corrosion; insect or animal damage; and pollution, may not be covered at allunder our policies. Therefo

In
 addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims bythird

 to the currencies of other countries, our United States dollar reported income from sources where revenue is dominated in the currencies of othersuch countries will decre
ase. 
 
• Any
violation
of
the
Foreign
Corrupt
Practices
Act
or
any
other
similar
anti-corruption
laws
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
us
. A significant portion of our revenue
 is  derived  from  operations  outside  the  United  States,  which  exposes  us  to  complex  foreign  and  U.S.  regulations  inherent  in  doing  cross-borderbusiness
 and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act(“FCPA”)
 and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreigngovernment officials 
for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot besure
 that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporateethics. Violations of these 
laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties against us, andthe
 SEC and U.S. Department of Justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks mayadversely affect our bus
iness, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
• We
face
risks
related
to
pending
claims
that
have
been
, or
future
claims
that
may
be
, brought
against
us
.  Claims have been brought against us and oursubsidiaries in
 various legal proceedings, and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecutionof
 our current or future legal proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition andresults of operations. Pleas
e see the further discussion in “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.   
 
• A
significant
portion
of
our
labor
force
is
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
. Work stoppages and other labor p roblems could negatively affect ourbusiness
 and results of operations. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 34,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Aprolonged dispute with the cover
ed employees or any labor unrest, strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others couldhave
 an adverse impact on our operations. Further, adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation andreduce customer demand for our services. Also, wage and/or benefit increase
s resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have anadverse
 impact on our results of operations. In addition, to the extent that our non-union employees join unions, we would have greater exposure to risksassociated with labor probl
ems.23

  
Furthermore, we may have,  or acquire in the future, multi-employer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered,” or “critical” status. For instance,
 Borgata’s  most  significant  plan  is  the  Legacy  Plan  of  the  National  Retirement  Fund,  Former  HEREIU  and  Local  54,  which  has  been  listed  in“critical
 status” and is subject to a rehabilitation plan. Plans in these classifications must a dopt  measures to improve their funded status through a fundingimprovement
 or  rehabilitation  plan,  which  may  require  additional  contributions  from  employers  (which  may  take  the  form  of  a  surcharge  on  benefitcontributions)
 and/or modifications to retiree b enefits.  In addition, while Borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans, a withdrawal in thefuture
 could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time (or over a period of time) th at would vary based on a number of factors 
at the time of (and after) withdrawal. Any such additional costs may be significant. 
 
• Our
business
is
particularly
sensitive
to
energy
prices
and
a
rise
in
energy
prices
could
harm
our
operating
results
.  We are a large consumer of electricityand
 other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs mayhave
 a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitationto our resorts and a reduct
ion in our revenues. 
 
• The
failure
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
our
computer
systems
and
internal
customer
information
could
result
in
damage
of
reputation
and/or
subject
us
tofines
, payment
of
damages
, lawsuits
or
restrictions
on
our
use
or
transfer
of
data
. We collect  and store information relating to our employees and guests forvarious
 business  purposes,  including  marketing  and  promotional  purposes.  The  collection  and  use  of  personal  data  are  governed  by  privacy  laws  andregulations enacted
 in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistentfrom one jurisdiction to 
another. 
Compliance
 with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties andservices
 to our guests. In addition, non-compliance  with applicable privacy regulations  by us (or in some circumstances  non-compliance  by third partiesengaged
 by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result indamage
 of reputation  and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions  on our use or transfer of data. We rely on proprietary  andcommercially
 available  systems,  software,  tools  and  monitoring  to  provide  security  for  processing,  transmission  and  storage  of  customer  and  employeeinformation,
 such  as  payment  card  and  other  confidential  or  proprietary  information.  Our  data  security  measures  are  reviewed  and  evaluated  regularly;however,
 they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats. In addition, while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist inthe cost of recovery fro
m a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient .  
We also rely
 extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. Disruptions in the availability of ourcomputer
 systems, through cyber attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results ofoperations.
 For instance, there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has beencompromised
 and  company  data  has  been  destroyed.  Our  information  systems  and  records,  including  those  we  maintain  with  our  third-party  serviceproviders,
 may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future. In addition, our third-party information system service providers face risks relating tocyber security similar to ours,
 and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use ofcustomer or company
 data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material disruption toour
 operations  and  management  team,  and  result  in  remediation  expenses,  regulatory  penalties  and  litigation  by  customers  and  other  parties  whoseinformation was subject to su
ch attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
• We
may
seek
to
expand
through
investments
in
other
businesses
and
properties
or
through
alliances
or
acquisitions,
and
we
may
also
seek
to
divest
some
ofour
properties

and
other
assets,
any
of
which
may
be
unsuccessful
. We  intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions and investments in otherbusinesses,
 properties or other assets. Furthermore, we may pursue any of these opportunities in alliance with third parties, including MGP. Acquisitions andinvestments in businesses, prope
rties or assets, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to: 
 
• spending cash and incurring debt;  
• assuming contingent liabi lities; 
• unanticipated issues in in tegrating information, communications and other systems; 
• unanticipated incompa tibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods; 
• retaining key employees ; and24

  
• consolidating corporate a nd administrative infras tructures.  
We
 cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we willactually realiz
e any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances. 
In addition,
 we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non-core, no longer complement our business,are
 in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums. From time to time, we may attempt to sell theseidentified properti
es and assets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 
• If
the
jurisdictions
in
which
we
operate
increase
gaming
taxes
and
fees
, our
results
could
be
adversely
affected
. State and local authorities raise a significantamount of revenue through taxes and
 fees on gaming activities. From time to time, legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws, orin the
 administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such effortsto
 raise  revenues  through  increases  in  gaming  taxes.  If  the  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate  were  to  increase  gaming  taxes  or  fees,  depending  on  themagnitude
 of the increase and any offsetting factors, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. For instance,income
 generated from gaming operations of MGM Grand Paradise currently has the benefit of a corporate tax exemption in Macau, which exempts us frompaying
 the 12% complementary tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games. This exemption is effective through March 31, 2020, which alsoruns
 concurrent with the end of the term of the current gaming subconcession. Due to the uncertainty concerning taxation after the subconcession renewalprocess, we cannot assure you that 
any extensions of the tax exemption will be granted beyond March 31, 2020.

 conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of MGM China. Decisions that could have different implicationsfor
 us and MGM China, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with MGM China, may give rise to theappearance of a potential co

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS  
Securities

and
derivative
litigation.
  In 2009 various shareholders filed six lawsuits in Nevada federal and state court against the Company and various of itsformer
 and current directors and officers alleging federal securities laws violations and/or related breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with statements allegedlymade
 by the defendants during the period August 2007 through the date of such lawsuit filings in 2009 (the “class period”). In general, the lawsuits asserted the same orsimilar
 allegations, including that during the relevant period defendants artificially inflated the Company’s common stock price by knowingly making materially false andmisleading statements
 and omissions to the investing public about the Company’s financial statements and condition, operations, CityCenter, and the intrinsic value of theCompany’s
 common stock; that these alleged misstatements and omissions thereby enabled certain Company insiders to derive personal profit from the sale of Companycommon stock to the public; 
that defendants caused plaintiffs and other shareholders to purchase Company common stock at artificially inflated prices; and that defendantsimprudently
 implemented  a  share  repurchase  program  to  the  detriment  of  the  Company.  The  lawsuits  sought  unspecified  compensatory  damages,  restitution  anddisgorgement of alleged p
rofits and/or attorneys’ fees and costs in amounts to be proven at trial, as well as injunctive relief related to corporate governance.   
The
 state and federal court derivative actions were dismissed pursuant to defendants’ motions. In November 2009, the U.S. District Court for Nevada consolidatedthe remaining cases

No.
2:09-cv-01558-GMN-LRL.
 The  consolidated case names the Company and certain former andcurrent
 directors and officers as def endants  and alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. In January2011,
 lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, alleging that between August 2, 2007 and March 5, 2009, the Compa ny,  its directors and certain of itsofficers violated Sec
tions 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   
In
 July 2015, the lead plaintiffs and defendants agreed in principle to settle the securities class actions. In August 2015, the lead plaintiffs and defendants enteredinto
 a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the “Settlement Agreement”). Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the claims against the Company and thenamed former and
 current directors and officers will be dismissed with prejudice and released in exchange for a $75 million cash payment by the Company’s directors andofficers liability insurers.
 
On
 March 1, 2016, the court entered a Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal with Prejudice (the “Final Judgment”) of the two cases consolidated under In 
reMGM

MIRAGE
Securities
Litigation
.   Of the thousands of putative class members, only one objected to the adequacy of the settlement. The court entered the FinalJudgment
 over his objection, finding that the settlement was fair, reasonable and adequate to the settlement class in all respects, and dismissed the actions and all releasedclaims
 with  prejudice  as  to  all  defendants,  and  expressly  provided  that  neither  the  settlement  nor  associated  negotiations  and  proceedings  constitute  an  admission  orevidence of liabili
ty, fault or omission by the defendants.   
On
 March 25, 2016, the sole objector to the adequacy of the settlement filed a Notice of Appeal as to the Final Judgment and related orders entered by the courtconcerning the plan of set
tlement distribution and award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the lead plaintiffs’ counsel. The appeal has been fully briefed and is awaiting anorder from the court of 
appeals. 
If
 the Final Judgment is reversed on appeal, the case would be remanded and the Company and all other defendants plan to continue to vigorously defend againstthe claims asserted in these
 securities cases. 
Other.


We and our subsidiaries are also defendants in various other lawsuit s, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to our business. We do not believethat the outcome of such pend
ing litigation, considered in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company.

 and the contractual limitations described below who will evaluate our dividend policy from time to time based on factors it deems relevant. In addition, as aholding
 company with no independent operations, our ability to pay dividends will depend upon the receipt of cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the fundsfrom
 operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, our senior credit facility contains financial covenants and restrictive covenants that couldrestrict
 our ability to pay dividends, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the MGM National Harbor, Operating Partnership, and MGM China credit facilities eachcontain

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSI ON
AND
ANALYSIS
OF
FINANCIAL
C
ONDITION
AND
RESULTS
OF 
OPERATIONSExecutive
Overview
Our
 primary  business  is  the  ownership  and  operation  of  casino  resorts,  which  offer  gaming,  hotel,  convention,  dining,  entertainment,  retail  and  other  resortamenities.
 We own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. Most ofour revenue
 is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the ability of our resortsto generate
 operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings. We make significant investmentsin our resorts through newly remod
eled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities.During
 the year ended December 31, 2016, Las Vegas visitor volume increased 1%, Las Vegas Strip REVPAR increased 6% and Las Vegas Strip gaming revenueincreased by less than 1% co
mpared to the prior year period according to information published by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Results of operationsfor
 our domestic resorts during 2016 benefited from an increase in operating margins resulting from increases in gaming revenue and REVPAR, and the results of ourProfit
 Growth Plan, discussed below. Our rooms revenue benefited from increased visitation to the Las Vegas market and robust convention business at our Las VegasStrip resorts, which allowed us to yi
eld higher room rates across our portfolio of resorts.Gross gaming
 revenues in the Macau market decreased 3% in 2016 compared to 2015, and gross gaming revenues decreased 34% in 2015 compared to 2014. As asignificant
 number of MGM Macau’s customers are from mainland China, we believe operating results were negatively affected by economic conditions in mainlandChina
 as well as certain policy initiatives in mainland China and Macau. Specifically, a continuing slowdown in China’s economic growth rate, the Chinese government’srestrictions
 on travel and cross-border currency transactions, new compliance regulations for gaming promoters and gaming operators enacted by the Macau governmentand
 implemented in late 2015 and in 2016 and a ban on mobile phone usage at gaming tables in an attempt to eliminate “proxy” bets have all negatively affected MGMMacau’s
 high-end customers and the gaming promoters with which we conduct our VIP casino gaming operations. In addition, the Chinese government’s anti-corruptioncampaign
 has changed consumption patterns and affected the propensity of our clients to spend on certain areas like gaming or luxury items. The Macau government alsoimplemented a full main floor casino smoking ban in October 2014
. These factors led to a continued decrease in gross gaming revenues for the Macau market beginning inthe
 second  half  of  2014  and  lasted  into  2016  primarily  impacting  VIP  casino  gaming  operations  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  main  floor  operations  throughout  the  Macaumarket. 
Despite  concerns over the recent events and the sustainability of economic growth in China, we expect the Macau market to grow on a long-term basis due tofurther development, penetration of the mainland China market and infrastructure improvement
s expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within Macau, and webelieve
 recent trends reflect stabilization within the Macau market. According  to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of the Macau Government, afterseveral
 quarters  of  declines  in  visitation  throughout  2015,  visitor  arrivals  increased  slightly  by  1%  and  overnight  visitors  increased  10%  in 2016  compared  to  2015.Additionally, gross gaming revenu
e increased year over year in each of the months from August 2016 through December 2016.Our
 results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. While we continue to befocused
 on improving our financial position, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities. In Macau, we estimate costs to develop MGM Cotai willbe
 approximately  $3.3 billion, excluding development  fees eliminated  in consolidation,  capitalized  interest and land related  costs. MGM Cotai is a casino resort withcapacity
 for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1,500 slots, and featuring approximately 1,500 hotel rooms, built on an approximately 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip inMacau.
 The actual number of gaming tables allocated to MGM Cotai will be determined by the Macau government prior to opening, and such allocation is expected to beless than our 500 gaming table 
capacity. MGM Cotai is expected to open in the second half of 2017.We
 were awarded a casino license to build and operate MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts. MGM Springfield will be developed on approximately 14acres
 of land in downtown Springfield. MGM’s plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 3,000 slots and 100 table games including poker; a 250-room
 hotel;  100,000  square  feet  of  retail  and  restaurant  space;  44,000  square  feet  of  meeting  and  event  space;  and  a  3,375-space  parking  garage;  with  an  expecteddevelopment
 and construction cost of approximately $865 million, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs. Construction of MGM Springfield is expected tobe completed in late 2018.
In
 August 2015, we announced the implementation of a Profit Growth Plan for sustained growth and margin enhancement. The Profit Growth Plan’s initiativesfocused
 on improving business processes to leverage our scale for greater efficiency and lower costs, and to identify areas of opportunity to organically drive incrementalrevenue
 growth. The Profit Growth Plan included a large number of initiatives to optimize operations and we continue to explore additional opportunities to drive furtherimprovement. In June 2016,
32

 we
 announced that we expect to achieve approximately $400 million of annualized Adjusted EBITDA benefit compared to our baseline, which we expect to be fully realized by the end of 2017.
Formation
and
Initial
Public
Offering
o
f
MGPOn
 April 25, 2016, MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”) completed its IPO of 57,500,000 of its Class A shares representing limited liability company interests(inclusive of the full exercise by the underwriters of
 their option to purchase 7,500,000 Class A shares) at an initial offering price of $21 per share. MGP used the proceedsfrom
 the IPO to purchase Operating Partnership units in MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”), to which we contributed thereal
 estate assets associated with The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroitand Beau Rivage in exchange for Oper
ating Partnership units in the Operating Partnership in connection with the IPO.MGP
 is organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an “UPREIT”) structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by, andsubstantially
 all of its businesses are conducted through the Operating Partnership. MGP contributed the proceeds from the IPO to the Operating Partnership in exchangefor 26.7% of the units in the Operating Partnershi
p. The general partner of the Operating Partnership is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of MGP. As a result, MGP controlsand
 consolidates the Operating Partnership. MGP has two classes of authorized and outstanding voting common shares (collectively, the “shares”): Class A shares and asingle
 Class B share. We own MGP’s Class B share, which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operationsof
 MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP. MGP’s Class A shareholders are entitled to one vote per share, while we, as the owner of the Class B share, areentitled
 to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares so long as our and our controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregatebeneficial
 ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below 30%. As such, we control MGP through our majorityvoting rights
 and consolidate MGP in our financial results. Subsequent to our acquisition of Borgata and subsequent contribution of Borgata’s real estate assets to MGP asdiscussed
 below, our ownership in the Operating Partnership, increased from 73.3% to 76.3%. As a result of the Borgata transaction, MGP’s ownership in the OperatingPartnership was correspondingly r
educed from 26.7% to 23.7%.In
 connection  with  the  formation  of  MGP,  we  borrowed  $4.0  billion  under  certain  bridge  facilities,  the  proceeds  of  which  were  used  to  repay  outstandingobligations under our prior senior credit facility and
 to redeem our 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and our 10% senior notes due 2016. The bridge facilities were subsequentlyassumed by the Operating Partne
rship pursuant to the master contribution agreement. The Operating Partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of proceedsfrom certain finan
cing transactions and the proceeds from the IPO.Acquisition
of
Borgata
Hotel
Casino
&
Spa
On August 1, 2016, we completed the acquisiti
on of Boyd Gaming Corporation’s (“Boyd Gaming”) ownership interest in Borgata, at which time Borgata became aconsolidated
 subsidiary of ours. Accordingly, we recorded a gain of approximately $430 million as a result of the acquisition of Borgata and resulting consolidation ofBorgata,
 which  we  previously  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method.  See  Note  4  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional  information.Following completion of the acqu
isition, MGP subsequently acquired Borgata’s real property from a subsidiary of ours in exchange for MGP’s assumption of $545 millionof
 indebtedness  from  our  subsidiary  and  the  issuance  of  $27.4  million  Operating  Partnership  units  to  our  subsidiary.  In  connection  with  the  Borgata  transaction,  weborrowed
 $545 million under certain bridge facilities, which were subsequently contributed to the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership repaid the bridgefacilities
 with a combination of cash on hand and a draw down on their revolving credit facility, which it subsequently refinanced with proceeds from its offering of its4.5% senior notes due 2026. 
Pursuant to an amendment to the master lease, MGP leased back the real property of Borgata to a subsidiary of ours and as a result, initial rentpayments to MGP increased by $100 millio
n, prorated for the remainder of the first lease year after the Borgata transaction. Consistent with the master lease terms, 90% ofthis rent is fixed and will 
contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022.Reportable
Segments
We
 have two reportable segments: domestic resorts and MGM China. We currently own and operate 14 resorts in the United States. MGM China’s operationsconsist
 of  MGM  Macau  resort  and  the  development  of  MGM  Cotai  on  the  Cotai  Strip  in  Macau.  We  have  additional  business  activities  including  investments  inunconsolidated
 affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. CityCenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for afee.
 Our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as “corporate and other” operations in our reconciliations of segment results toconsolidated results.

 Domestic
resorts.
At December 31, 2016, our domestic r esorts consisted of the following casino resorts: 
Las Vegas, Nevada:
  
Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), TheMirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Excalibur, Monte Car
lo and Circus Circus Las Vegas.Other:
  
MGM  Grand  Detroit  in  Detroit,  Michigan;  Beau  Rivage  in  Biloxi,  Mississippi;  Gold  Strike  Tunica  in  Tunica,Mississippi; Borgata in Atlant
ic City, New Jersey; and MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland.Over
 half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming
 amenities.  We  market  to  different  customer  groups  and  utilize  our  significant  convention  and  meeting  facilities  to  maximize  hotel  occupancy  and  customervolumes
 which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on demand for our services, and the volume of customers at our resorts,which
 in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities. Also, we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our domestic resorts inLas
 Vegas, Nevada, which exposes us to certain risks, such as increased competition from new or expanded Las Vegas resorts, and from the expansion of gaming in theUnited States generally.
Key performance indica
tors related to gaming and hotel revenue at our domestic resorts are: 
• Gaming  revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Ournormal table
 games hold percentage is in the range of 19% to 23% of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of 8.5% to 9% ofslots handle; and
 
• Hotel  revenue indicators: hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate (“ADR,” a price indicator); and revenue per available room (“REVPAR,”a
 summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day,includes
 the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or “cash” rates for each customersegment
 and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates. Complimentary rates are reviewed at leastannually
 and  on  an  interim  basis  if  there  are  significant  changes  in  market  conditions.  Because  the  mix  of  rooms  provided  on  a  complimentary  basis,particularly
 to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than theADR for cash rooms, reflecting th
e higher retail value of suites.MGM
China.
Subsequent  to the acquisition of an additional 4.95% of the outstanding common shares of our MGM China subsidiary in September 2016, we ownan
 approximate 56% controlling interest in MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, the Macau company that owns and operates MGM Macau and the relatedgaming
 subconcession  and  land  concessions,  and  is  in  the  process  of  developing  MGM Cotai.  We  believe  our  investment  in  MGM  China  plays  an  important  role  inextending our reach inte
rnationally and will foster future growth and profitability.Revenues
 at MGM Macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the Macau gaming market: VIP casino gaming operations, main floor gamingoperations, and slot machine operations. VI
P players play mostly in dedicated VIP rooms or designated gaming areas. VIP customers can be further divided into customerssourced
 by  in-house  VIP  programs  and  those  sourced  through  gaming  promoters.  A  significant  portion  of  our  VIP  volume  is  generated  through  the  use  of  gamingpromoters.
 Gaming promoters introduce VIP gaming players to MGM Macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gaming credit to these players.In
 exchange for their services, gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover based commissions. In-house
 VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. MGM Macau main floor operations primarily consist of walk-inand
 day trip visitors. Unlike gaming promoters and in-house VIP players, main floor players do not receive commissions. The profit contribution from the main floorsegment
 exceeds  the  VIP  segment  due  to  commission  costs  paid  to  gaming  promoters. Gaming  revenues  from  the  main  floor  segment  have  become  an  increasinglysignificant portion of to
tal gaming revenues in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future.VIP
 gaming at MGM Macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips fromMGM
 Macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow MGM Macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gamingpromoters’
 clients in order to determine VIP gaming play. Gaming promoter commissions are based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of thetable games
 turnover they generate . They also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate, which can be appliedto
 hotel rooms, food and beverage and other discretionary customers-related expenses. The estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amountspassed
 through to VIP customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue, and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recordedas casino expense. In-house VIP comm
issions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue.34

 In
 addition to the key performance ind icators  used by our domestic resorts, MGM Macau utilizes “turnover,” which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers wonby
 MGM  Macau  calculated  as  nonnegotiable  chips  purchased  plus  nonnegotiable  chips  exchanged  less  nonnegotiable  chips  returned.  Turnover  p rovides  a  basis  formeasuring VIP casino win percent
age. Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM Macau is typically in the range of 2.7% to 3.0% of turnover.Corporate

and
other.
Corporate  and other includes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain management and other operations. See  Note 1 andNote 7 to the accompanying consol
idated financial statements for discussion of the Company’s unconsolidated affiliates.

  2,079,787    (156,232 )   1,323,538  
 
Consolidated
 net revenues for 2016 increased 3% compared to 2015 due primarily to  the Borgata transaction on August 1, 2016, the opening of MGM NationalHarbor
 in December 2016 and an increase in casino revenue, rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and other revenue including parking fee revenue at our domesticresorts, partially offset by a
 decrease in casino revenue at MGM China. Consolidated net revenues  for 2015 decreased 9% compared to 2014 due primarily to a decrease incasino
 revenue at MGM China, offset by increases in casino and non-casino revenue at our domestic resorts. See “Operating Results – Detailed Segment Information”below for additional infor
mation related to segment revenues. 
Consolidated
 operating  income  of $2.1 billion  in 2016 compared  to an operating  loss of $156 million  in 2015. Operating  income in 2016 benefited  from $39 million
 of  operating  income  from  Borgata  subsequent  to  the  acquisition, a  $430  million  gain  recognized  on  the  Borgata  transaction,  and  an  increase  in  income  fromunconsolidated
 affiliates primarily due to a $401 million gain related to the sale of Crystals at CityCenter (see “Operating Results – Income (Loss) from UnconsolidatedAffiliates”
 for further discussion). Operating income in 2016 was also negatively affected by charges of $152 million of NV Energy exit expense associated with theCompany’s
 strategic decision to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy, which includes expense at our domestic resorts as well as our 50% share of expenserecognized
 at  CityCenter,  an  increase  in  preopening  expense,  and  an  increase  in  corporate  expense.  See  “Operating  Results  –  Details  of  Certain  Charges”  below  foradditional
 detail on our preopening expense. Corporate expense increased to $313 million in 2016, due primarily to costs  incurred to implement initiatives related to theProfit
 Growth Plan of $23 million, costs associated with  the initial  public  offering  of MGP of $25 million,  transaction  costs incurred  in connection  with the Borgatatransaction, increm
ental performance-based compensation expense, and costs associated with a litigation settlement. 
Consolidated operating loss of $156 million in
 2015 was negatively affected by an operating loss for MGM China that included a $1.5 billion non-cash impairmentcharge
 to goodwill recognized in the acquisition of a controlling interest in MGM China in 2011. In connection with that acquisition, we recorded a $3.5 billion non-cashgain. The 2015 impairment charge, which represents
 approximately 42% of the amount of the previously recognized gain, resulted from our annual review of our goodwillcarrying values and was incurred as a
 result of reduced cash flow forecasts for MGM China’s resorts based on market conditions at that time and lower valuation multiplesfor
 gaming assets in the Macau market. In addition, the operating loss was affected by a decrease in operating results at MGM Macau. The operating loss for MGM Chinawas
 partially offset by an increase in operating income at our domestic resorts and an increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates, primarily from CityCenter, whichincluded
 $80 million related to our share of the gain recognized by CityCenter as a result of the final resolution of its construction litigation and related settlements. Inaddition,
 corporate expense increased 15% to $275 million in 2015, due primarily to costs  incurred to implement initiatives in relation to the Profit Growth Plan of $24million
 and $20 million in costs associated with the MGP transaction. Preopening  expense, primarily related to our MGM Cotai, MGM Springfield and MGM NationalHarbor
 development projects, increased to $71 million in 2015 compared to $39 million in 2014. Consolidated operating loss in 2015 was also negatively affected byimpairment
 charges and losses on disposal of certain assets recorded in “Property transactions, net.” See “Operating Results – Details of Certain Changes” below foradditional detail related to pr
operty transactions.

management services and was $397 million, $399 million and $383 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Adjusted
 EBITDA related to corporate and other in 2016 increased due to our gain recognized from the sale of Crystals at CityCenter. See “Operating Results –Income

We
 completed  our  acquisition  of  Borgata  on  August  1,  2016,  at  which  time  the  subsidiary  operating  Borgata  became  a  consolidated  subsidiary.  Prior  to  theacquisition, we held a 50% int
erest in Borgata, which was accounted for under the equity method. 
In
 2016, our share of CityCenter’s operating results, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $445 million, which included $13 million related to ourshare
 of NV Energy exit expense representing CityCenter’s share of a charge associated with our strategic decision to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy,$41
 million related to our share of accelerated depreciation related to the April 2016 closure of the Zarkana theatre, as well as $401 million related to our share of a gainrecognized
 by CityCenter on the sale of Crystals and the reversal of certain basis differences. At Aria, casino revenues decreased 2% in 2016 compared to 2015, due to a7%
 decrease in table games volume partially offset by an increase in hold percentage to 24.6% in 2016 compared to 23.8% in 2015. The decrease in table games revenuewas
 partially offset by a 2% increase in slots revenue. REVPAR increased by 4% and 8% at Aria and Vdara, respectively, which led to a 7% increase in CityCenter’srooms revenue in 2016 compared 
to 2015. 
In
 2015, our share of CityCenter’s operating results, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $159 million and included $80 million related to our shareof
 a gain recognized by CityCenter as a result of the final resolution of its construction litigation and related settlements, compared to an operating loss of $12 million in2014.
 Casino revenue at Aria increased 6% in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to an increase in table games volume and slots volume of 2% and 3%, respectively.CityCenter’s
 rooms  revenue  increased  5%  in  2015  compared  to  2014,  due  to  increases  in  REVPAR  of  6%  and  8%  at  Aria  and  Vdara,  respectively.  The  increase  inrevenues
 from resort operations was partially offset by a decrease in residential revenues. CityCenter’s operating income in 2015 benefited from a $99 million decrease indepreciation
 expense as a result of certain furniture and equipment becoming fully depreciated in December 2014 offset in part by $20 million in accelerated depreciationfor
 certain assets associated with the Zarkana theatre, which was closed in April 2016. CityCenter’s operating income also benefited from a $26 million decrease in legaland
 professional  fees  as  a  result  of  the  final  resolution  of  construction  litigation  and  related  settlements.  Our  share  of  Borgata’s  operating  income  increased  in  2015compared to 2014 due to an incr

In
 2016, interest cost related to MGM Resorts, excluding MGM China, decreased compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in the average long-termdebt
 outstanding, and also due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate, partially offset by an increase in amortization of debt issuance cost associated with theMGP
 related financing transactions in April 2016. Interest cost related to MGM China increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increase in the average outstandingamounts
 borrowed  under  the  MGM  China  credit  facility  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  amortization  of  debt  issuance  costs.  In  2015,  interest  cost  related  to  MGMResorts,
 excluding China, decreased compared to 2014 as a result of a decrease in the average long-term debt outstanding during the year related to our senior notes.Interest
 cost related to MGM China increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to an increase in the average outstanding amounts borrowed under the MGM China creditfacility
 and an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from costs incurred associated with the refinancing of the MGM China credit facility in June2015.

 Non-operating  expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $23 million in 2016 compared to 2015,due
 primarily to the acquisition of Borgata on August 1, 2016, at which time the subsidiary operating Borgata became a consolidated subsidiary of our company. Prior tothe
 acquisition, we held a 50% ownership interest in Borgata, which was accounted for under the equity method. Non-operating expense from unconsolidated affiliatesdecreased $11 million in 2015 
compared to 2014, due primarily to a decrease in interest expense at CityCenter. 
Other,

net.
Other  expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to a $16 million loss on the early retirement of debt related to the $743 million7.625%

Our
 effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by income tax benefits attributable to a decrease in valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryovers andpermanent
 exclusion of a portion of the gain on the Borgata transaction, partially offset by income tax expense attributable to the remeasurement of Macau deferred taxliabilities
 resulting from a change in assumption concerning renewal of the exemption from the Macau complementary tax on gaming profits. Our effective tax rate in2015
 was unfavorably impacted by the non-cash impairment  charge on MGM China goodwill for which we did not record income tax benefit. Our effective tax ratedecreased
 in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of providing greater tax benefit in 2015 than in 2014 for foreign tax credits, net of valuation allowance, partiallyoffset by tax benefit r
esulting from audit settlements in 2014.41

  
Cash
 taxes paid increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in federal income taxes paid due to increased U.S. taxable income. Cashtaxes
 paid decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of a $16 million refund of taxes and associated interest received in 2015 on the closure of the IRSexamination of CityCenter, which is treated as
 a partnership for income tax purposes which partially offset federal income tax estimated tax payments of $23 million madeduring the year. The rema
ining $5 million of cash taxes paid in 2015 consist of state and foreign income taxes. 
Non-GAAP
Measures
 
“Adjusted EBITDA” is
 earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses,NV
 Energy exit expense, gain on Borgata transaction, goodwill impairment charges, and property transactions, net. “Adjusted Property EBITDA” is Adjusted EBITDAbefore
 corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to both the MGM Resorts and MGP stock-based compensation plans, which are not allocated to eachreportable
 segment  or  operating  segment,  as  applicable.  MGM  China  recognizes  stock  compensation  expense  related  to  its  stock-based  compensation  plan  which  isincluded in
 the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for MGM China. “Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA” is Adjusted Property EBITDA related to the operating resortswhich
 were consolidated by the Company for both the entire current and prior year periods presented. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Property EBITDA information ispresented
 solely  as  a  supplemental  disclosure  to  reported  GAAP  measures  because  management  believes  these  measures  are  1)  widely  used  measures  of  operatingperformance in the gaming
 and hospitality industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies. We present Adjusted Property EBITDA ona
 “same-store” basis as supplemental information for investors because management believes that providing performance measures on a “same-store” basis is useful forevaluating the period-to-peri
od performance of our domestic casino resorts. 
We
 believe  that  while  items  excluded  from  Adjusted  EBITDA,  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  and  Same-Store  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  may  be  recurring  innature
 and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared toother
 periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods beingpresented.
 Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-upexpenses
 will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lieswithin
 the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales ofassets
 related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges onentire asset groups or investments in unconsolidate
d affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, capital allocation, tax planning, financing andstock
 compensation  awards  are  all  managed  at  the  corporate  level.  Therefore,  we  use  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  and  Same-store  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  as  theprimary measure of domestic re
sorts operating performance. 
Adjusted
 EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or netincome,
 as an indicator of our performance; or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity; or as any other measure determined inaccordance
 with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  We  have  significant  uses  of  cash  flows,  including  capital  expenditures,  interest  payments,  taxes  and  debtprincipal
 repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA, or Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA. Also, other companies in thegaming
 and  hospitality  industries  that  report  Adjusted  EBITDA,  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  or  Same-store  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  information  may  calculateAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Same-store Adjusted Prop
erty EBITDA in a different manner.

Summary
 
We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts. In addition to required cash on hand for operatio
ns, we utilize company-wide cash managementprocedures
 to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from accounts at our resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds areinvested
 overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstandingdebt
 securities subject to limitations in our senior credit facility. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we held cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion,respectively.
 Cash  and  cash  equivalents  related  to  MGM  China  at  December  31,  2016  and  2015  was  $454  million  and  $700  million,  respectively.  Cash  and  cashequivalents related

Cash
Flows
 
Operating
activities.
Trends in  our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes inworking
 capital, cash paid for interest, the timing of significant tax payments or refunds, and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. Cash provided by operatingactivities
 was $1.5 billion in 2016 compared to $1.0 billion in 2015. Operating cash flows increased in the current period due to an increase in operating income at ourdomestic
 resorts and a decrease in cash paid for interest, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes. Cash provided by operating activities in the prior year wasnegatively affected by chan
ges in working capital primarily related to short-term gaming liabilities. 
Cash
 provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased due to a decrease in operating cash flows at MGM China which were $383 million in 2015 compared to$642 million in 2014, partial
ly offset by an increase in operating cash flows at our domestic resorts.45

 In 2015, 
cash  provided by operating activities at MGM China was negatively affected by changes in working capital related to short-term gaming liabilities but to a lesserextent than in 2014.
 
We paid net taxes of $68 mi
llion, $12 million and $42 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Investing
activities.
Our investing  cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investmentsin
 new  or  existing  resorts,  business  acquisitions  or  dispositions,  and  the  timing  of  more  regular  capital  investments  to  maintain  the  quality  of  our  resorts.  Capitalexpenditures related
 to more regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotelrooms. Most of such costs relat
e to construction materials, furniture and fixtures, and external labor costs.

 costs related to the refinancing of the MGM China credit facility. In 2014, we had net borrowings of $714 million, including the repayment of $28 million underour
 senior credit facility. During  the year we repaid  our $509 million  5.875% senior notes at maturity and  issued $1.25 billion of 6% senior notes, due 2023 for netproceeds of $1.24 billion.
During
 the year ended 2016, MGP received proceeds of $1.2 billion in connection with the MGP IPO in April 2016 and paid $75 million of issuance costs relatedto the
 IPO, and we paid $100 million as part of the consideration for the purchase of an additional 188.1 million common shares of our MGM China subsidiary. MGP paida
 $15 million dividend and a $22 million dividend to its Class A shareholders in July 2016 and October 2016, respectively. In August 2016, MGM China paid an interimdividend
 of $58 million, of which $29 million was distributed to noncontrolling interests. In June 2016, MGM China paid a final dividend of $46 million of which $23million was distributed to non
controlling interests. 
MGM China paid a $400 million specia
l dividend in March 2015, a $120 million final dividend in June 2015 and a $76 million interim dividend in August 2015, ofwhich $196
 million, $59 million and $37 million was distributed to noncontrolling interests, respectively. Additionally, we received $6 million in 2015 related to proceedsfrom
 the issuance of non-voting membership interests in MGM National Harbor. MGM  China paid a $499 million special dividend in March 2014, a $127 million finaldividend
 in June 2014, and a $137 million interim dividend in September 2014, of which $245 million, $62 million and $67 million was distributed to noncontrollinginterests, respectively.

 We have significant outs tanding debt and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures. At December 31, 2016, wehad
 $13.1  billion  in  principal  amount  of  indebtedness,  including  $250  million  of  borrowings  outstanding  under  our  $1.5  billion  senior  credit  facility,  $2.1  billionoutstanding
 under  the  $2.73  billion  Operating  Partnership  credit  facility,  $1.9  billion  outstanding  under  the  $3.0  billion  MGM  China  credit  facility  and  $450  millionoutstanding
 under the $525 million MGM National Harbor credit facility. We have an estimated $751 million of cash interest payments based on current outstanding debtand
 applicable interest rates within the next twelve months including the estimated impact of changes in our interest rates on the MGP term loan B and new interest rateswap
 agreements entered into subsequent to year end. We believe we have the ability to meet known obligations, including principal and interest obligations as well asplanned
 capital expenditures over the next twelve months from the balance sheet date with existing cash and cash deposits, cash flows from operations, dividends anddistributions
 from MGM China and the Operating Partnership, and availability under our senior credit facility, the MGM China credit facility, the Operating Partnershipcredit facility 
and the MGM National Harbor credit facility.

 In
 addition, we have made significant investments through December 31, 2016 and we expect to make capital investments as described below during 2017. See“Executive Overview” for fu
r ther information reg arding the scope and timing of our significant development projects. 
 
• Approximately $530 million in capital expenditures at our domestic resorts and corporate entities, excluding MGM National Harbor and MGM Springfield; 
• Approximately $270 million in capital expenditures related to the MGM Springfield project; and 
• Approximately $150 million in capital expenditures related to MGM National Harbor. 
During
 2017, MGM China expects to spend approximately $100 million in maintenance capital improvements at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai once opened, and$990 million on the MGM Cotai projec
t, excluding capitalized interest, development fees and land related costs. 
Our
 capital expenditures fluctuate depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts and the timing of capitalinvestments
 to maintain the quality of our resorts, the amounts of which can vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotelrooms.
 Future capital expenditures could vary from our current expectations depending on the progress of our development efforts and the structure of our ownershipinterests in future dev
elopments.

dividend.

On  February 16, 2017, as part of its regular dividend policy, the Board of Directors of MGM China announced it will recommend a finaldividend for 2016 of $78 million to MGM China sh
areholders subject to approval at the MGM China 2017 annual shareholders meeting to be held in May. If approved, wewill
 receive our 56% share or $44 million, of which $4 million will be paid to Grand Paradise Macau under the $50 million deferred cash payment arrangement related toour
 acquisition  of  the  additional  4.95%  of  MGM  China  shares  in  August  of  2016.  See  Note  13  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additionalinformation regarding the 
deferred cash payment. 
Principal
Debt
Arrangements
 
As
 discussed in “Executive Overview” in connection with the formation and IPO of MGP, we and MGP entered into several financing transactions including newprincipal debt agree
ments. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding those agreements. 
In
 April 2016, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement comprised of a $1.25 billion revolving facility and a $250 million term loan A facility.The
 revolving facility and the term loan A facility bear interest determined by reference to a total net leverage ratio pricing grid which results in an interest rate of LIBORplus 1.75%
 to 2.75%. Both the term loan A facility and the  revolving  facility  will mature in April 2021. The term loan A facility is subject to amortization of principal inequal
 quarterly installments (commencing with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017), with 5.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the term loan A facility tobe payable each year. No amoun
ts have been drawn on the revolving credit facility.The
 amended and restated credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants,including
 that we maintain compliance with a maximum total net leverage ratio, a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. We werein compliance with our am
ended and restated credit agreement covenants at December 31, 2016.48

 The
 amended and restated credit agreement is secured by (i)  a mortgage on the real properties comprising the MGM Grand Las Vegas and the Bellagio, (ii) apledge of
 substantially all existing and future personal property of our subsidiaries that own  the  MGM Grand Las Vegas and the Bellagio; and (iii) a pledge of the equity or limited liabil
ity company interests of the entities that own MGM Grand Las Vegas and the Bellagio.Mandatory
  prepayments  of  the credit facilities will be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets, casualty events and theincurrence of certain additional
 indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights. 
In
 April 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into a credit agreement comprised of a $300 million senior secured term loan A facility, a $1.85 billion seniorsecured
 term loan B facility, and a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The term loan B facility was originally issued at 99.75% to initial leaders. Therevolving
 credit facility and term loan A facility bear interest determined by reference to a total net leverage ratio pricing grid which results in an interest rate of LIBORplus
 2.25% to 2.75%. On October 26, 2016 the term loan B facility was re-priced at par and bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%, whichrepresented a
 50 basis point reduction compared to the prior rate. In addition, the Operating Partnership received a further reduction in pricing to LIBOR plus 2.50%, witha
 LIBOR floor of 0.75%, as a result of it achieving a minimum corporate family rating of Ba3/BB- in February 2017. The revolving credit facility and the term loan Afacility will matu
re in 2021 and the term loan B facility will mature in 2023. The term loan facilities are su bject to amortization of principal in equal quarterly installments,with
 5.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the term loan A facility and 1.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the term loan B facility to be payableeach year.
 
The
 Operating Partnership credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants,including
 that the Operating Partnership maintain compliance with a maximum senior secured net debt to adjusted total assets ratio, maximum total net debt to adjustedassets ratio and a mini
mum interest coverage ratio. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with its credit agreement covenants at December 31, 2016.  
MGM
 China and MGM Grand Paradise, as co-borrowers, are parties to a fourth amended and restated credit facility which consists of $1.55 billion of term loansand
 a $1.45 billion revolving credit facility. The interest rate on the facility fluctuates annually based on HIBOR plus a margin that ranges between 1.375% and 2.5%based
 on MGM China’s leverage ratio. The credit facility matures in April 2019, with scheduled amortization payments of the term loans beginning in October 2017. TheMGM
 China  credit  facility  is  secured  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  interest  in  the  Cotai  land  use  right,  and  MGM  China,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  and  their  guarantorsubsidiaries have grante
d a security interest in substantially all of their assets to secure the facility. 
The
 MGM China credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants, including thatMGM
 China  maintains  compliance  with  a  maximum  leverage  ratio  and  a  minimum  interest  coverage  ratio.  MGM  China  was  in  compliance  with  its  credit  facilitycovenants
 at December 31, 2016. In February 2017, the MGM China credit facility was amended to increase the maximum total leverage ratio to 6.00 to 1.00 throughDecember 31, 2017, declining to 5.50 to 1.00 
at March 31, 2018, 5.00 to 1.00 at June 30, 2018 and 4.50 to 1.00 at September 30, 2018 and thereafter. 
In
 January 2016, MGM National Harbor, LLC entered into a credit agreement consisting of a $100 million revolving credit facility and a $425 million term loanfacility.
 The revolving and term loan facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable rate determined by MGM National Harbor, LLC’s total leverage ratio (2.25% asof
 December  31,  2016).  The  term  loan  and  revolving  facilities  are  scheduled  to  mature  in  January  2021  and  the  term  loan  facilities  are  subject  to  scheduledamortization
 payments on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning the fourth full fiscal quarter following the opening date of MGM National Harbor, initially in anamount
 equal  to  1.25%  of  the  aggregate  principal  balance  and  increasing  to  1.875%  and  2.50%  of  the  aggregate  principal  balance  on  the  last  day  of  the  twelfth  andsixteenth full fiscal quarters
, respectively.  
The MGM
 National Harbor credit agreement is secured by a leasehold mortgage on MGM National Harbor and substantially all of the existing and future propertyof
 MGM  National  Harbor.  Mandatory  prepayments  will  be  required  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events,  including  sales  of  certain  assets,  casualty  events  and  theincurrence of
 certain additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights. In addition, to the extent MGM National Harbor generates excess cashflow
 (as defined in the MGM National Harbor credit agreement), a percentage of such excess cash flow (ranging from 0% to 50% based on a total leverage ratio) will berequired to be used to prepay 
the term loan facilities commencing with the fiscal year ending 2017.   
The
 MGM National Harbor credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants,including that MGM National Harbor, LLC and 
its restricted subsidiaries maintain compliance with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.MGM National Harbor, LLC was in compliance wi
th its credit agreement covenants at December 31, 2016.

 Off
Balance
Sheet
Arrangements
 
Our
 off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which consist primarily of our investments in CityCenter, GrandVictoria,
 and  Las  Vegas  Arena  Company,  LLC.  We  have  not  entered  into  any  transactions  with  special  purpose  entities,  nor  have  we  engaged  in  any  derivativetransactions,
 other than our MGP cash flow hedges. See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. Our unconsolidatedaffiliate
 investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a full-scale resort or other entertainment properties in a manner that minimizes our initialinvestment.
 We guarantee the T-Mobile Arena credit facility as described below. In addition, there are no other provisions in the agreements with our investees which webelieve are unusual or subj
ect us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort. 
In
 conjunction with the Las Vegas Arena Company, LLC entering into a senior secured credit facility in September 2014, we and AEG each entered into joint andseveral
 completion guarantees for the project (which were subsequently terminated in February 2017), as well as a repayment guarantee for the term loan B (which issubject
 to  increases  and  decreases  in  the  event  of  a  rebalancing  of  the  principal  amount  of  indebtedness  between  the  term  loan  A  and  term  loan  B  facilities).  As  ofDecember 31, 2016, term loan A was $150 mi
llion and term loan B was $50 million.

Estimated  interest  payments  are  based  on  principal  amounts  and  expected  maturities  of  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2016  and  management’s  forecastedLIBOR
 rates for our senior credit facility and HIBOR rates for the MGM China credit facility. In December 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into interestrate
 swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan B facility. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flowhedges
 and  have  a  notional  value  of  $500  million  and  mature  on  November  30,  2021.  The  weighted  average  fixed  rate  paid  is  1.825%,  and  the  variable  ratereceived resets month
ly to the one-month LIBOR subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%.(2)
The  amount for 2017 includes $471 million related to MGM Cotai and $39 million and $76 million related to MGM National Harbor and MGM Springfield,respectively.
(3)
The  table above excludes our future lease obligations to a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership pursuant to the master lease agreement discussed in Note 19 tothe accompanying consolidated financial statements. We own 76
.3% of the Operating Partnership units as of December 31, 2016. MGM National Harbor is locatedon land subject to a long-te
rm ground lease. See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.(4)
Approximately  $12 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and other tax liabilities are excluded from the table as we cannot reasonably estimatewhen examination and other a
ctivity related to these amounts will conclude or when these amounts will be paid, if ever.(5)
The  amount for 2017 includes $124 million related to employment agreements, $129 million for entertainment agreements and $120 million of open purchaseorders.
 Other commitments include various contracted amounts, including information technology, advertising, maintenance and other service agreements. Ourlargest
 entertainment commitments consist of minimum contractual payments to Cirque du Soleil, which performs shows at several of our resorts. Our contractualcommitments
 for these shows generally do not exceed 12 months and are based on our ability to exercise certain termination rights; however, we expect theseshows to continue for longer periods.
 
While
 we  have  significant  indebtedness  and  other  obligations,  we  believe  we  have  the  ability  to  meet  known  obligations,  including  principal  and  interestobligations
 as  well  as  planned  capital  expenditures  over  the  next  twelve  months  from  the  balance  sheet  date  with  existing  cash  and  cash  deposits,  cash  flows  fromoperations, dividends and distr
ibutions from MGM China and the50

 Operating
 Partnership, and availability under our senior credit facility, the MGM China credit facility, the Operating Partnership credit facility and the MGM NationalHarbor
 c redit  facility. We have $138 million of maturities of long-term debt in 2017. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Other Factors Affecting Liquidity” forfurther discussion of anti
cipated uses of cash. 
Critical
Accounting
Policies
and
Estimates
 
Management’s
 discussion  and  analysis  of  our  results  of  operations  and  liquidity  and  capital  resources  are  based  on  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  Toprepare
 our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates andassumptions
 that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas weconsider
 to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position orcash
 flows. Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates,and
 have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actualresults can differ f
rom our estimates. 
Allowance

ivable 
Marker
 play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our Las Vegas resorts. Our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to thesame
 extent,  although  we  offer  markers  to  customers  at  those  casinos  as  well.  MGM  China  extends  credit  to  certain  in-house  VIP  gaming  customers  and  gamingpromoters.
 We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely.These
 collection  efforts  are  similar  to  those  used  by  most  large  corporations  when  dealing  with  overdue  customer  accounts,  including  the  mailing  of  statements  anddelinquency notices, persona
l contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United Statesand
 Macau.  At  December  31,  2016  and  2015,  approximately  53%  and  42%,  respectively,  of  our  casino  accounts  receivable  at  our  domestic  resorts  were  owed  bycustomers
 from the United States. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may bereached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. At December 3
1, 2016 and 2015, approximately 35% and 37%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable atour
 domestic resorts were owed by customers from the Far East. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit tocustomers
 at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the United States. MGM China performs background checks and investigates the credit worthiness of gamingpromoters and casino custom
ers prior to issuing credit. 
We
 maintain  an  allowance,  or  reserve,  for  doubtful  casino  accounts  at  all  of  our  operating  casino  resorts.  The  provision  for  doubtful  accounts,  an  operatingexpense,
 increases the allowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts. At domestic resorts where marker play is notsignificant, the allowance is
 generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances. At domestic resorts where marker play is significant,we
 apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balanceover
 the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s financial condition, collection history and any other known information. MGM Chinaspecifically
 analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financial condition and the collectionhistory of the gaming promot
er or casino customer. 
In
 addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors,including changes in curren
cy exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries. Because individual customer account balances can be significant,the
 allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economyoccur.
 
The following table shows key statis
tics related to our casino receivables:

Approximately
 $35 million and $40 million of casino receivables and $8 million and $9 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate toMGM China at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respec
tively. Casino receivables increased in the51

 current
 year as a result of the Borgata transaction and the opening of MGM Nationa l  Harbor. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accountsreceivable has decr
eased in the current year due to a decrease in the age of outstanding account balances. At December 31, 2016, a 100 basis-point change in the allowancefor 
doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by $3 million. 
Fixed
Asset
Capitalization
and
Deprec

Policies 
Property
 and equipment are stated at cost. For the majority of our property and equipment, cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fairvalues
 in connection with the August 2016 Borgata acquisition, the June 2011 MGM China acquisition, the April 2005 Mandalay acquisition and the May 2000 MirageResorts
 acquisition. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred.Depreciation and
 amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of theproject,
 including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries. In addition, interest cost associatedwith major development
 and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project usingthe
 weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantiallycomplete or developmen
t activity is suspended for more than a brief period. 
We
 must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capitalasset
 is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which alsomay
 be  a  matter  of  judgment.  In  addition,  our  depreciation  expense  is  highly  dependent  on  the  assumptions  we  make  about  our  assets’  estimated  useful  lives.  Wedetermine
 the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Whenever events orcircumstances occur whi
ch change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively. 
Impairment
of
Long-lived
Assets,
Goodwill
and
Inde
finite-lived
Intangible
Assets 
We
 evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used. Severalcriteria
 must  be  met  before  an  asset  is  classified  as  held  for  sale,  including  that  management  with  the  appropriate  authority  commits  to  a  plan  to  sell  the  asset  at  areasonable
 price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value orfair
 market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, wereview
 for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carryingvalue
 of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value,then
 an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. For operating assets, fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model wherebyfuture
 cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in ourindustry.
 If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held forsale or assets to be held and us
ed, are recorded as operating expenses. 
There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-li
ved assets. First, management must determine the usage of the asset. Tothe
 extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest level for whichidentifiable cash
 flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash flow estimates are,by their nature, subjecti
ve and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. 
On
 a  quarterly  basis,  we  review  our  major  long-lived  assets  to  determine  if  events  have  occurred  or  circumstances  exist  that  indicate  a  potential  impairment.Potential factors which could
 trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic factors,significant
 changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probabilityweight
 cash  flows  in  certain  circumstances  to  consider  alternative  outcomes  associated  with  recoverability  of  the  asset  group,  including  potential  sale.  Historically,undiscounted cash flows of our signif
icant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. 
We
 review  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  and  goodwill  at  least  annually  and  between  annual  test  dates  in  certain  circumstances.  We  perform  our  annualimpairment test
 for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights, which aretested
 for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks, which are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royalty method. See Note 8 to theaccompanying consolidated 
financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.

 Goodwill
 repre sents  the  excess  of  purchase  price  over  the  fair  market  value  of  net  assets  acquired  in  business  combinations.  We  test  goodwill  for  relevantreporting
 units for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and in interim periods if circumstances exist suc h  that it is more likely than not that the carrying value ofa
 reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Accounting guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill (commonly referred to as “stepzero”)
 in  order  to  determi ne  whether  further  impairment  testing  is  necessary.  In  performing  the  step  zero  analysis  we  take  into  account  macroeconomic  conditions,industry
 and market considerations, current and forecasted financial performance, entity-specific events, and changes in the  composition or carrying amount of net assetsof
 reporting units. In addition, management takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair value over carrying value determined in the last quantitative analysis thatwas performed, as well as the p
e riod of time that has pass ed since the last quantitative analysis. If the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fairvalue of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, further quantitative analysis is not required. If the 
step zero analysis indicates that it  is more likely than not that the fairvalue of a reporting unit 
is less than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to a two-step quantitative analysis. 
Under the two-step quantitat
ive analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgetedfuture
 results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry,and
 market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples inour
 peer group. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an indication of impairment exists and we must proceed to measure an impairment loss, ifany.
 In measuring an impairment loss, the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. The implied fair value ofgoodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting u
nit to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining, if any, is the implied fair value of goodwill. Ifthe implied fair va
lue of goodwill is less than its carrying value then it must be written down to its implied fair value. 
With
 the  exception  of  our  MGM  China  reporting  unit,  discussed  below,  none  of  our  other  reporting  units  incurred  any  goodwill  impairment  chargesin
 2016, 2015 or 2014. For our 2016 annual impairment test, we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our domestic resorts reporting units andconcluded
 it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. The estimated fair values ofreporting
 units for which we elected to forego the step zero analysis and instead utilized the two-step quantitative analysis were substantially in excess of their carryingvalues. As
 discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If future operating results of our reporting units do not meetcurrent expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to excee
d their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. 
During
 the fourth quarter of 2015, we conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of our reporting units, including our MGM Chinareporting
 unit. The step one goodwill analysis of the MGM China reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4%. The decrease in fair valueresulted
 from a decrease in forecasted cash flows based on then current market conditions and a sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples of the MGM Chinareporting
 unit as well as those of the MGM China reporting unit’s peer group. As a result of the indication of impairment from the step one analysis, we proceeded toperform
 a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss. As  such, we determined the fair values of all assets of the MGM China reporting unit, includingits
 separately identifiable intangible assets. The fair values of each of the separately identifiable intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by a significantamount,
 leading to a lower implied fair value of goodwill.  Therefore,  we recorded a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to reduce the historical carrying value ofgoodwill related to the MGM China r
eporting unit to its implied fair value in 2015. 
There
 are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actualresults
 may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests arehighly judgmental and dependen
t in large part on expectations of future market conditions. 
See Note 8 to the accompanying conso
lidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment. 
Impairment
of
Investments
in
Unconsolidat
ed
Affiliates 
We
 evaluate  our  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of  ourinvestment
 may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. If such conditions exist, we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carryingvalue
 to  determine  whether  an  impairment  is  indicated  and  determine  whether  the  impairment  is  other-than-temporary  based  on  our  assessment  of  relevant  factors,including
 consideration of our intent and ability to retain our investment. We estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cashflows
 and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates, as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based ona
 range of multiples in our peer group. See Note 7 and Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of other-than-temporary impairmentcharges.

Income
Taxes
 
We
 recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with afuture tax benefit to 
the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. 
As
 of December 31, 2016, we have a foreign tax credit carryover of $2.8 billion against which we have recorded a valuation allowance of $2.5 billion based uponour
 assessment of future realization. The foreign tax credits are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. BecauseMGM
 Grand  Paradise  is  presently  exempt  from  the  Macau  12%  complementary  tax  on  gaming  profits,  we  believe  that  payment  of  the  Macau  Special  Gaming  Taxqualifies as a tax paid 
in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. taxes. 
On
 September 7, 2016, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an additional extension of the complementary tax exemption through March 31, 2020, concurrent withthe
 end of the term of its current gaming subconcession. A competitor of MGM Grand Paradise subsequently received an additional extension of its exemption throughMarch
 31, 2020, which also runs concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming concession. Based upon these developments and the uncertainty concerningtaxation after
 the concession renewal process, we have concluded that we can no longer assume that MGM Grand Paradise will be entitled to additional exemption periodsbeyond
 the end of the extension recently granted. Thus, for all periods beyond March 31, 2020, we have assumed that MGM Grand Paradise will pay the Macau 12%complementary
 tax  on  gaming  profits  and  will  thus  not  be  able  to  credit  the  Macau  Special  Gaming  Tax  in  such  years,  and  have  factored  that  assumption  into  ourassessment of the realization
 of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset and the measurement of Macau deferred tax liabilities.  
Due to
 improvements in our U.S. operations, we have generated U.S. operating profits for the past eight consecutive quarters and as of June 30, 2016 we no longerhad
 cumulative U.S. losses in recent years. Consequently, during 2016 we began to rely on future U.S. source operating income in assessing future foreign tax creditrealization during th
e 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period.  
Our
 assessment of realization of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability of anddistributions
 from MGM China and assumptions concerning future U.S. operating profits. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for avaluation
 allowance and changes to our assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of the valuation allowance. For example, a change to our forecasts offuture
 profitability of and distributions from MGM China or a change in our assumptions concerning U.S. profitability could result in a material change in the valuationallowance with a
 corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in such period. In addition, should we in a future period actually receive an additional exemptionfrom
 the  complementary  tax,  an  additional  valuation  allowance  would  likely  need  to  be  provided  on  some  portion  or  all  of  the  foreign  tax  credit  deferred  tax  asset,resulting in an increas
e in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material.  
In
 addition, there is a $3 million valuation allowance, after federal effect, provided on certain state deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance of $71 million oncertain Macau defe
rred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $2 million on Hong Kong net operating losses because we believe these assets do not meet the “more likelythan not” criteria 
for recognition. 
We
 file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in foreignjurisdictions
 are not material. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. Positions taken in taxreturns
 are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities. See Note 12 in the accompanyingconsolidated financia
l statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities. 
We
 assess our tax positions using a two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold, and is measured at the largestamount
 of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. Uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date. Liabilities we record as aresult
 of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts, and are classified as current in “Other accrued liabilities” or long-term in“Other
 long-term  liabilities”  based  on  the  time  until  expected  payment.  Additionally,  we  recognize  accrued  interest  and  penalties,  if  any,  related  to  unrecognized  taxbenefits in income tax 
expense.Stock-based
Compensation
 
We
 account for stock options and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) measuring fair value using the Black-Scholes model. For restricted share units (“RSUs”),compensation expense is ca
lculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant.54

 We
 account for performance stock units (“PSUs”) measuring fair  value using the Monte Carlo valuation model. There are several management assumptions required todetermine
 the inputs into the Black-Scholes model and Monte Carlo valuation model. Our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model can significantly
 affect the fair value of stock options and SARs. The Monte Carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions, including volatility, to determine thefair
 value of the award. Changes in the subjective assumptions can material ly  affect the estimate of the fair value of share-based compensation and consequently, therelated amount recogn
ized in the consolidated financial statements. The extent of the impact will depend, in part, on the extent of awards in any given year. 
Market
Risk
 
In
 addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. Market risk is the risk of loss arising fromadverse
 changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associatedwith
 our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-termborrowings
 under  our  bank  credit  facilities.  A  change  in  interest  rates  generally  does  not  have  an  impact  upon  our  future  earnings  and  cash  flow  for  fixed-rate  debtinstruments. As
 fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changesin
 interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for tradingpurposes and do not enter into der
ivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.In
 December 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan Bfacility.
 These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and have a notional value of $500 million and mature on November 30, 2021. The weighted averagefixed
 rate paid is 1.825%, and the variable rate received resets monthly to the one-month LIBOR subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%. In January 2017, the OperatingPartnership
 entered into additional interest rate swap agreements through November 2021 with a total $700 million notional amount to pay a fixed rate of 1.964% andreceive
 the 1-month LIBOR rate in order to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan B facility. The Company does not currently have anymaster netting arrangements related
 to its derivative contracts. See Note 11 for additional information.As of
 December 31, 2016, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 32% of our total borrowings after giving effect to the $500 million notional amountOperating
 Partnership interest rate swaps discussed above. Assuming a 100 basis-point increase in LIBOR (in the case of the MGP term loan B facility, over the 0.75%floor
 specified in the Operating Partnership credit facility and after giving effect to the $500 million notional amount Operating Partnership interest rate swaps discussedabove), our
 annual interest cost would increase by $23 million based on gross amounts outstanding at December 31, 2016. Assuming a 100 basis-point increase in HIBORfor
 the MGM China credit facility, our annual interest cost would increase by $19 million based on amounts outstanding at December 31, 2016. The following tableprovides
 additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding the effect of the Operating Partnership interest rate swapsdiscussed above:

In
 addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, mainlyrelated
 to MGM China and to our operations at MGM Macau and the development of MGM Cotai. While recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant,potential
 changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in these exchangerates.
 We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or the current peg rate for the Hong Kong dollar will remain at thesame
 level. The possible changes to the peg of the Hong Kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. As of December 31, 2016, a 1%increase
 in the Hong Kong dollar (the functional currency of MGM China) to the U.S. dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by $4million and a 1% decre
ase in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by $20 million.

Management’s
Responsibilities
 
Management
 is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Sections 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) ofthe Exchange Act) for MGM Resorts Int
ernational and subsidiaries (the “Company”). 
Objective
of
Internal
Control
o
ver
Financial
Reporting 
In
 establishing adequate internal control over financial reporting, management has developed and maintained a system of internal control, policies and proceduresdesigned
 to provide reasonable assurance that information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this annualreport is
 reliable, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact, and fairly presents in all material respects the financial condition,results of operations and c
ash flows of the Company as of and for the periods presented in this annual report. These include controls and procedures designed to ensure thatthis
 information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriatefor all timely decisions regar
ding required disclosure. Significant elements of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting include, for example: 
 
• Hiring skilled accounting pe rsonnel and training them appropriately; 
• Written accounting policies;  
• Written documentat ion of accounting systems and procedures; 
• Segregation of incompatib le duties; 
• Internal audit funct ion to monitor the effectiveness of the system of internal control; and 
• Oversight by an independent Audit Commi ttee of the Board of Directors. 
Management’s
Evaluation
 
Management, with the participation
 of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the Company’s internal control overfinancial reporting
 using the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the TreadwayCommission.
 In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, the Company has excluded the operations of Marina DistrictDevelopment
 Company, LLC, which owns and operates Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa (“Borgata”) because these operations were acquired in a business combination onAugust
 1, 2016. These operations represent approximately 7% of the Company’s total assets at December 31, 2016 and approximately 4% of the Company’s total netrevenues
 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company intends to disclose any material changes in internal control over financial reporting with respect to theBorgata operations in the year ending December 31,
 2017, the first annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting in which it is required to include Borgata. 
Based
 on its evaluation as of December 31, 2016, management believes that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective in achieving theobjectives described abov
e.

We
 have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016, based oncriteria
 established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As describedin
 Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting atMarina
 District Development Company, LLC (the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa), which was acquired on August 1, 2016, and whose financial statements constitute 7% oftotal
 assets and 4% of total net revenues of the Company’s consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. Accordingly, ouraudit
 did  not  include  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  at  Marina  District  Development  Company,  LLC.  The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  formaintaining
 effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  theaccompanying
 Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial  Reporting.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  theCompany’s internal control ov
er financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that weplan
 and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Ouraudit
 included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the designand
 operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Webelieve that our audit p
rovides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
 company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  by,  or  under  the  supervision  of,  the  company’s  principal  executive  and  principalfinancial
 officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonableassurance regarding the reliability
 of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accountingprinciples.
 A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonabledetail,
 accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  asnecessary to
 permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company arebeing
 made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timelydetection of unauthoriz
ed acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
 of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,material
 misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internalcontrol
 over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree ofcompliance with the poli
cies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
 our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteriaestablished in Interna
l Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
We
 have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statementsand
 financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our report dated March 1, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financialstatements and financial statement
 schedule.

 December 31, 2016. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts included in Item 15(a)(2). These financialstatements
 and  the  financial  statement  schedule  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company’s  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  financialstatements and financ
ial statement schedule based on our audits. 
We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that weplan
 and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a testbasis,
 evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  An  audit  also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significantestimates made by man
agement, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
 our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MGM Resorts International and subsidiariesas
 of  December  31,  2016  and  2015,  and  the  results  of  their  operations  and  their  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2016,  inconformity
 with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered inrelation to the basic con
solidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 
We
 have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control overfinancial
 reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal 
Control—Integrated
Framework
(2013)
 issued  by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations
 of  the  Treadway  Commission  and  our  report  dated  March  1,  2017,  expressed  an  unqualified  opinion  on  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financialreporting.

 the Company owns and operates MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan. The Company owns and operates the following resorts in Mississippi: Beau Rivagein
 Biloxi and Gold Strike in Tunica. Subsequent to its acquisition on August 1, 2016, the Company owns and operates the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa (“Borgata”),located
 on Renaissance Pointe in the Marina area of Atlantic City, New Jersey. See Note 4 for additional information on the Borgata transaction. The Company owns andoperates
 Shadow  Creek,  an  exclusive  world-class  golf  course  located  approximately  ten  miles  north  of  its  Las  Vegas  Strip  resorts,  Primm  Valley  Golf  Club  at  theCalifornia/Nevada state
 line and Fallen Oak golf course in Saucier, Mississippi. Additionally , the  Company owns and operates MGM National Harbor in Prince George’sCounty, Maryland, which opened on December 8, 2016.
 
On April
 25, 2016, MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 57,500,000of
 its Class A shares representing limited liability company interests (inclusive of the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 7,500,000 Class Ashares)
 at an initial offering price of $21 per share. In connection with the IPO, the Company and MGP entered into a series of transactions and several agreements that,among other things, set forth 
the terms and conditions of the IPO and provide a framework for the Company’s relationship with MGP. 
MGP
 is organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an “UPREIT”) structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by, andsubstantially
 all  of  its  businesses  are  conducted  through,  its  Operating  Partnership  subsidiary,  MGM  Growth  Properties  Operating  Partnership  LP  (the  “OperatingPartnership”).
 MGP contributed the proceeds from the IPO to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 26.7% of the Operating Partnership units representing limitedpartner
 interests  in  the Operating  Partnership.  The general  partner  of the Operating  Partnership  is also a subsidiary  of  MGP. MGP has two classes  of authorized  andoutstanding
 voting common shares (collectively, the “shares”): Class A shares and a single Class B share. The Company owns MGP’s Class B share, which does notprovide
 its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP. MGP’s Class Ashareholders
 are entitled to one vote per share, while the Company, as the owner of the Class B share, is entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the totalvoting
 power of MGP’s shares so long as the Company and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interestsin MGP and the Operating Partnership does no
t fall below 30%. 
Pursuant
 to  a  master  contribution  agreement  entered  into  in  connection  with  the  IPO  by  and  between  the  Company,  MGP  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  theCompany
 contributed the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGMGrand
 Detroit and Beau Rivage to newly formed subsidiaries and subsequently transferred 100% ownership interest in such subsidiaries to the Operating Partnership inexchange for 73.3% of the Opera
ting Partnership units in the Operating Partnership on the closing date of the IPO. In addition, on August 1, 2016, the Company completedits
 acquisition of Borgata and subsequently contributed Borgata’s real estate assets to MGP, as discussed in Note 4. As a result of the Borgata transaction, as discussed inNote
 20, the Company’s indirect  ownership in the Operating  Partnership  units increased  to 76.3% and MGP’s Class A shareholders’  ownership interest  in OperatingPartnership
 units was reduced to 23.7%. The Operating Partnership units held by the Company are exchangeable into Class A shares of MGP on a one-to-one basis, orcash
 at the fair value of a Class A share. The determination of settlement method is at the option of MGP’s independent conflicts committee. See Note 10 and Note 19 foradditional informat
ion related to MGP, the IPO and certain other intercompany agreements and debt financing transactions entered into in connection therewith. 
The
 Company acquired an additional 4.95% interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (“MGM China”) on September 1, 2016, which increased its ownership toapproximately
 56%. See Note 14 for additional information. The Company has a controlling interest in MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGMGrand Paradise”), the Macau 
company that owns and operates the MGM Macau resort and casino and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions, and is in theprocess
 of developing an 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip in Macau (“MGM Cotai”). MGM Cotai will be an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort with capacityfor
 up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1,500 slots, and featuring approximately 1,500 hotel rooms. The actual number of gaming tables allocated to MGM Cotai will bedetermined
 by the Macau government  prior to opening, and such allocation  is expected  to be less than MGM Cotai’s 500 gaming table capacity.  The total estimatedproject budget is $3
.3 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest and land related costs.

il, dining and entertainment district. See Note 7 and Note 19 for additional information related to CityCenter. 
The
 Company and a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc. (“AEG”) each own 42.5% of the Las Vegas Arena Company, LLC (“Las Vegas ArenaCompany”),

BASIS
OF

PRESENTATION
AND
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIESPrinciples

of
consolidation.
For  entities not determined to be a variable interest entity (“VIE”), the Company consolidates such entities in which the Companyowns 100%
 of the equity. For entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity if it has the direct or indirectability
 to control the entities’ activities based upon the terms of the respective entities’ ownership agreements. For these entities, the Company records a noncontrollinginterest
 in  the consolidated  balance  sheets.  The Company’s  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  which are  50% or  less owned  are  accounted  for under  the equitymethod
 when the Company can exercise significant influence over or has joint control of the unconsolidated affiliate. All intercompany balances and transactions areeliminated in consolidation.
The
 Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. A VIEis
 an entity  in which either  (i)  the equity investors  as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar  rights to direct  the activities  of such entity that  mostsignificantly
 impact  such  entity’s  economic  performance  or  (ii)  the  equity  investment  at  risk  is  insufficient  to  finance  that  entity’s  activities  without  additionalsubordinated
 financial support. The Company identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: (i) the power todirect
 the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the VIE thatcould
 potentially be significant to the entity. The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary. For these VIEs, theCompany records
 a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets.  The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE upon subsequent events such asthe modification of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity inve
stments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of aninterest held by the pri
mary beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.Management
 has determined that MGP is a VIE because the Class A equity investors as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct theactivities
 of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of MGP andconsolidates MGP because (i) i
ts ownership of MGP’s single74

 Class
 B share entitles it  to a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares, and (ii) the exchangeable nature of the Operating Partnership units owned provide theCompany
 the  right  to  receive  benefits  from  MGP  that  could  potentially  be  significant  to  MGP.  The  Company  has  r ecorded  MGP’s  26.7%  interest  in  the  OperatingPartnership
 prior to the Borgata transaction and 23.7% interest subsequent to the Borgata transaction as noncontrolling interest in the Company’s consolidated financialstatements.
 As of December 31, 2016, on a consolidated  basis MGP had total assets of $9.5 billion, primarily related to its real estate investments, and total liabilities of$3.9 billion, primarily r
elated to its indebtedness.  Management’s

use
of
estimates.
The  consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited States of America. Thes
e principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilitiesand
 disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could 
differ from those estimates. 
Fair

value
measurements.
Fair  value  measurements  affect  the  Company’s  accounting  and  impairment  assessments  of  its  long-lived  assets,  investments  inunconsolidated
 affiliates,  cost  method  investments,  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  an  acquisition,  and  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets.  Fair  valuemeasurements
 also affect the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell anasset
 or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy that includes:Level
 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs.The Company used the following inputs in i
ts fair value measurements: 
 
• Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 10; 
• Level 2 inputs when measuring the fair value of its interest rate swaps. See Note 11; 
• Level 2 and Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the Borgata transaction. See Note 4; 
• Level 2 and Level 3 inputs when measuring the impairment of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit. See Note 8; and 
• Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of its investment in Grand Victoria. See Note 7 
Cash

and
cash
equivalents.
Cash  and cash  equivalents  include  investments  and interest  bearing  instruments  with maturities  of  90 days or less at  the date  ofacquisition. Such investments
 are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Book overdraft balances resulting from the Company’s cash management program arerecorded as accounts payab
le or construction payable as applicable. 
Accounts

receivable
and
credit
risk.
Financial  instruments  that  potentially  subject  the  Company  to  concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist  primarily  of  casinoaccounts receivable.
 The Company issues credit to approved casino customers and gaming promoters following background checks and investigations of creditworthiness.At
 December 31, 2016, 47% of the Company’s casino receivables at its domestic resorts were due from customers residing in foreign countries and 9% of the Company’scasino receivables related to
 MGM China. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables. 
Accounts
 receivable  are  typically  non-interest  bearing  and  are  initially  recorded  at  cost.  Accounts  are  written  off  when  management  deems  the  account  to  beuncollectible.
 Recoveries  of  accounts  previously  written  off  are  recorded  when  received.  An  estimated  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  is  maintained  to  reduce  theCompany’s
 receivables to their net carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on both a specific review of customer accounts aswell
 as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2016, no significant concentrationsof credit risk existed 
for which an allowance had not already been recorded. 
Inventories.
Inventories  consist primarily of food and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizablevalue.
 Cost is determined primarily using the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined using the costmethod.
 
Property

and
equipment.
Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost.  A  significant  amount  of  the  Company’s  property  and  equipment  was  acquired  throughbusiness
 combinations  and  therefore  recognized  at  fair  value  at  the  acquisition  date.  Gains  or  losses  on  dispositions  of  property  and  equipment  are  included  in  thedetermination
 of income or loss. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had accrued $36 million and $17 millionfor property and equipment wi
thin accounts payable and $32 million and $44 million related to construction retention accrued in other long-term liabilities, respectively.75

  
Property and equipment are g
enerally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis: 
Buildings and improvements
 20 to 40 years Land improvements
 10 to 20 years Furniture and fixtures
 3 to 20 years Equipment
 3 to 15 years  
The
 Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held and used.Several
 criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at areasonable price
 in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the lower of carrying value or fairmarket value less costs 
to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, the Companyreviews
 for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, tothe
 carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed thecarrying
 value, then an impairment charge is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still underdevelopment,
 future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets held for sale or assets to be held and used, arerecorded as operating exp
enses. 
Capitalized
interest.
The interest  cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project. When nodebt
 is  incurred  specifically  for  a  project,  interest  is  capitalized  on  amounts  expended  on  the  project  using  the  weighted-average  cost  of  the  Company’s  outstandingborrowings. Capitalization of 
interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period. 
Investments

in
and
advances
to
unconsolidated
affiliates.
The  Company has investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method.Under
 the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the Company’s share of the investees’ earnings and losses, amortization of certain basis differences, as well ascapital contributions
 to and distributions from these companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a return of investment and recorded asinvesting
 cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies operating income and losses as well as gains and impairmentsrelated
 to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of operating income or loss, as the Company’s investments in such unconsolidated affiliates are anextension of the Company’s core bus
iness operations. 
The Company evaluates its investments in unconsoli
dated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value ofits
 investment  may  have  experienced  an  “other-than-temporary”  decline  in  value.  If  such  conditions  exist,  the  Company  compares  the  estimated  fair  value  of  theinvestment to its
 carrying value to determine if an impairment is indicated and determines whether the impairment is “other-than-temporary” based on its assessment of allrelevant
 factors, including consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment. The Company estimates fair value using a discounted cash flowanalysis based
 on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach that utilizes business enterprisevalue
 multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. See Note 7 and Note 17 for results of the Company’s review of its investment in certain ofits unconsolidated affiliates.
 
Goodwill

and
other
intangible
assets.
Goodwill  represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations.Goodwill
 and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Companyperforms
 its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. No impairments  were indicated or recorded as a result of the annual impairment review forgoodwill
 and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2016  and 2014. An impairment of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit was recorded as a result of theannual impairment r
eview in 2015. See Note 8. 
Accounting
 guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill (commonly referred to as “step zero”) in order to determinewhether
 further  impairment  testing  is  necessary.  In  performing  the  step  zero  analysis  the  Company  considers  macroeconomic  conditions,  industry  and  marketconsiderations,
 current and forecasted financial performance, entity-specific events, and changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets of reporting units. Inaddition,
 the Company takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair value over carrying value determined in the last quantitative analysis that was performed, aswell
 as the period of time that has passed since the last quantitative analysis. If the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of areporting unit is less than 
its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to a two-step quantitative analysis. 
76

 Under the two-step quantitat
ive analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimatedfuture
 results of the Company’s reporting units discounted using market  discount rates and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approachthat
 utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. If the carrying value of the reporting u nit  exceeds its fairvalue, an indication of impairment exists and the
 Company must proceed to measure an impairment loss, if any. To measure an impairment loss, the implied fair value of areporting
 unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of tha t  goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reportingunit
 to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining, if any, is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less  than its carrying valuethen
 it must be written down to its implied  fair value. License rights are tested for impairment  using a discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks are tested forimpairment
 using the relief-from-royalty method. If the fair value  of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognizedequal to the difference.
 
Revenue

recognition
and
promotional
allowances.
Casino  revenue is the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognizedfor
 funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and for chips in the customers’ possession (“outstanding chip liability”). Hotel, foodand
 beverage,  entertainment,  retail  and  other  operating  revenues  are  recognized  as  services  are  performed  and  goods  are  provided.  Advance  deposits  on  rooms  andadvance ticket sales are recorde
d as accrued liabilities until services are provided to the customer. 
Gaming
 revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives, including discounts and points earned in point-loyalty programs. The retail value of hotel rooms,food
 and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances. The estimated cost ofproviding promotional allowan
ces is primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Gaming
promoters.
A  significant portion of the high-end (“VIP”) gaming volume at MGM Macau is generated through the use of gaming promoters, also knownas
 junket operators. These operators introduce VIP gaming players to MGM Macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gaming credit to theseplayers. VIP
 gaming at MGM Macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips fromMGM
 Macau  and  in  turn  sell  these  chips  to  their  players.  The  nonnegotiable  chips  allow  MGM  Macau  to  track  the  amount  of  wagering  conducted  by  each  gamingpromoter’s
 clients in order to determine VIP gaming play volume, or rolling chip turnover, which is the amount of nonnegotiable chips wagered and lost. In exchange forthe
 gaming promoters’ services, MGM Macau compensates the gaming promoters through revenue-sharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover-based commissions.The
 estimated portion of the gaming promoter commissions that represent amounts passed through to VIP customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue, and theestimated portion re
tained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense. 
Reimbursed

costs.
The  Company recognizes costs reimbursed pursuant to management services as revenue in the period it incurs the costs. Reimbursed costsrelated primari
ly to the Company’s management of CityCenter. 
Loyalty

programs.
The  Company’s primary  loyalty program is “M life Rewards” and is available  to patrons at most of the Company’s domestic  resorts andCityCenter.
 Members may earn points and/or Express Comps for their gaming play which can be redeemed at restaurants, box offices or the M life Rewards front desk atparticipating
 properties. Points may also be redeemed for free slot play on participating machines. The Company records a liability based on the points earned multipliedby

Redeemable

noncontrolling 
interest.
In  2015,  MGM  National  Harbor  issued  non-voting  economic  interests  in  MGM  National  Harbor  (“Interests”)  tononcontrolling
 interest parties, for a total purchase price of $6 million.  In 2016, MGM National Harbor issued Interests to noncontrolling interest parties for a purchaseprice
 of $47 million. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests includes $0.5 million relating to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended December31, 2016.  
 
The
 Interests provide for annual preferred distributions by MGM National Harbor to the noncontrolling interest parties based on a percentage of its annual netgaming
 revenue (as defined in the MGM National Harbor operating agreement). Such distributions will begin within ninety days after the end of the fiscal year in whichthe opening
 date of MGM National Harbor occurs, and after the end of each subsequent fiscal year. Also, beginning on the third anniversary of the last day of the calendarquarter
 in which the opening date of MGM National Harbor occurs (and on each subsequent anniversary thereof) the noncontrolling interest parties will each have theability
 to  require  MGM  National  Harbor  to  purchase  all  or  a  portion  of  their  Interests  for  a  purchase  price  based  on  a  contractually  agreed  upon  formula.  Certainnoncontrolling interest
 parties each have the right to sell back all or a portion of their Interests prior to such date if MGM National Harbor were to guarantee or grant liensto secure any indebtedness of 
the Company or its affiliates other than the indebtedness of MGM National Harbor. 
The
 Company has recorded the Interests as “Redeemable noncontrolling interests” in the mezzanine section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets andnot
 stockholders’  equity  because  their  redemption  is  not  exclusively  in  the  Company’s  control.  Interests  are  initially  accounted  for  at  fair  value.  Subsequently,  theCompany
 will recognize changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests to equal the maximumredemption
 value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The Company records any changes caused bysuch
 an  adjustment  in  retained  earnings  or  accumulated  deficit.  Additionally  the  carrying  amount  of  the  redeemable  noncontrolling  interests  is  adjusted  for  annualpreferred distribut
ions, with changes caused by such adjustments recorded within net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Currency

translation.
The  Company translates the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries that are not denominated in U.S. dollars. Balance sheet accountsare
 translated at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during theperiod. Translation adjust
ments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). 
Derivative

financial
instruments.
The  Company reflects all derivative instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities. For derivative instruments that aredesignated
 and qualify as hedging instruments, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow hedge instruments is recorded as a component of accumulatedother
 comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized within net income. As of December 31, 2016, all ofthe Company’s derivative f
inancial instruments are interest rate swap agreements which have been designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting.

Recently

issued
accounting
standards.
In  August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.2014-15,
 “Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40).” The guidance is intended to define management’s responsibility to evaluate whetherthere
 is substantial doubt about an organization’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to anorganization’s
 management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided byorganizations today
 in the financial statement footnotes. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016. The adoption ofthis guidance did not have an e
ffect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures. 
In
 2015 and 2016, the FASB issued the following ASUs related to revenue recognition, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, pursuant toASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date”:   
 
• ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from  Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting forrevenue
 arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU2014-09
 provides  for  a  new  revenue  recognition  model  which  includes  a  five-step  analysis  in  determining  when  and  how  revenue  is  recognized,including
 identification  of  separate  performance  obligations  for  each  contract  with  a  customer.  Additionally,  the  new  model  will  require  revenuerecognition
 to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receivein exchange for those goods or serv
ices; 
• ASU  2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),”clarifies
 the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations as it relates to ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-08 provides guidance related tothe
 assessment an entity is required to perform to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is,the
 entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good or service to be provided by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent) when another party isinvolved in providing goods or servic
es to a customer;80

  
• ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identi fying Performance Obligations and Licensing,” clarifies guidance related toidentifying
 performance  obligations  and  licensing  implementation  guidance  as  it  relates  to  ASU  2014-09.  ASU  2016-10  includes  targetedimprovements
 base d  on input the FASB received from the Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognition and other stakeholders. It seeks toproactively
 address areas in which diversity in practice potentially could arise, as well as to reduce the cost and complexity of ap plying certain aspects of the guidance both at imp
lementation and on an ongoing basis; and 
• ASU 2016-12, “Revenue from  Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,” addresses narrow-scopeimprovements to the guidance on collectability, noncash consideratio
n and completed contracts at transition as it relates to ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-12provides for
 a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes andother similar taxes collected from
 customers. 
The
 Company  is  currently  assessing  the  impact  that  the  adoption  of  the  above  ASUs  related  to  revenue  recognition  will  have  on  its  consolidated  financialstatements
 and footnote disclosures. However, the Company has identified a few significant impacts. Under the new guidance the Company expects it will no longer bepermitted
 to  recognize  revenues  for  goods  and  services  provided  to  customers  for  free  as  an  inducement  to  gamble  as  gross  revenue  with  a  corresponding  offset  topromotional
 allowances  to  arrive  at  net  revenues  as  discussed  above.  The  Company  expects  the  majority  of  such  amounts  will  offset  casino  revenues.  In  addition,accounting
 for Express Comps granted under the Company’s M life Rewards program as outlined above will also change. Under the new guidance Express Comps earnedby
 customers through past revenue transactions will be identified as separate performance obligations and recorded as a reduction in gaming revenues when earned at theretail
 value of such benefits owed to the customer (less estimated breakage). When customers redeem such benefits and the performance obligation is fulfilled by theCompany,
 revenue will be recognized in the department that provides the goods or services (i.e. hotel, food and beverage, entertainment). In addition, given that M lifeRewards
 is an aspirational loyalty program with multiple customer tiers which provide certain benefits to tier members, the Company will need to assess if such benefitsare deemed to be separ
ate performance obligations under the new guidance. 
In
 February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” (“ASU 2016-02”), which replaces the existing guidance in Accounting StandardsCodification (“ASC”)
 840, “Leases.” ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee wo
uld account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leaseswill
 result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense andamortization
 of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The Company is currently assessing the impact thatadoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolida
ted financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
In
 August  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2016-15,  “Statement  of  Cash  Flows  (Topic  230):  Classification  of  Certain  Cash  Receipts  and  Cash  Payments  (aconsensus
 of the Emerging Issues Task Force),” (“ASU 2016-15”), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2016-15 amends the guidance ofASC
 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The primary purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity inpractice
 that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles, specifically clarifying the guidance on eight cash flow issues. The Company does not expect the adoptionof ASU 2016-15 to have a material e
ffect on its consolidated financial statements. 
In
 January 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718),” (“ASU 2016-09”). ASU 2016-09 simplifies theaccounting
 for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, accounting for forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,and
 classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 has separate transition guidance for each element of the new standard. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 willnot have a material effect on t
he Company’s consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
In
 January 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-17, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held Through Related Parties that are Under Common Control,”(“ASU
 2016-17”). The amendments affect the evaluation of whether to consolidate a VIE in certain situations involving entities under common control. Specifically, theamendments
 change the evaluation of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE for an entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest by changinghow
 an entity treats indirect interests in the VIE held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The guidance in ASU 2016-17 mustbe
 applied retrospectively to all relevant periods. The adoption of ASU 2016-17 will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements andfootnote disclosures. 
 
In January 2017, the
 FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” The amendedguidance
 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under the amended guidance, the Company willperform its annual or interim
 goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and an impairment charge will be recognizedfor the amount by
81

 which
 the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit .  This guidance is effective forannual
 or  any  interim  goodwill  impairment  tests  in  fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,  2021,  with  early  adoption  permitted  for  interim  or  annual  goodwillimpairment
 tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 20 17.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact and timing of adopting this guidance, but anticipatesearly adoption in 2017.

BORGATA
TRANSACTION  
On
 August  1,  2016,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  Boyd  Gaming  Corporation’s  (“Boyd  Gaming”)  ownership  interest  in  Borgata.  Following  thecompletion of the
 acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s interest, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from the Company and leased back the real property to a subsidiary of theCompany. See Note 19 for additional in
formation.   
As
 part of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company agreed to pay Boyd Gaming half of any net amount received or utilized by the Company as it relates tothe
 Atlantic City property tax refund owed to Borgata at the time of the transaction. Pursuant to tax court judgments, The City of Atlantic City, New Jersey (“AtlanticCity”)
 owes Borgata property tax refunds of approximately $106 million, plus interest, related to the over-assessment of property values for the 2009-2012 tax years. As aresult
 of funding shortfalls, the City of Atlantic City has not paid the refunds due to Borgata and therefore, Borgata has withheld its current property tax obligations insatisfaction of the t
ax court judgment. Borgata applied $33 million of such credits as of December 31, 2016. After taking into account contingent consideration paid relatedto property tax refunds re
alized by Borgata, cash paid to Boyd Gaming for its interest in Borgata was $604 million. 
Through
 the acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s interest in Borgata, the Company obtained 100% of the equity interests in Borgata and therefore consolidated Borgataas
 of  August  1, 2016.  The  Company  recognized  100%  of  the assets  and  liabilities  of  Borgata  at  fair  value  at  the  date  of  the  acquisition.  Prior to  the  acquisition,  theCompany held a 50% ownership interest in Borgata, which was accounted for under
 the equity method. The fair value of the equity interests of Borgata was determined bythe
 transaction price and equaled approximately $1.2 billion. The carrying value of the Company’s equity method investment was significantly less than its share of thefair
 value of Borgata at the acquisition date, resulting in a $430 million gain on the acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the fair value was allocated to the assetsacquired and liabili
ties assumed in the transaction. The allocation of fair value has been finalized as of December 31, 2016. 
The following table sets for
th the finalized allocation at December 31, 2016 (in thousands):

 As discussed
 above, the Company recognized the identifiable intangible assets of Borgata at fair value. The trade name and customer relationship intangible assetsdid not
 have historical cost bases at Borgata. The estimated fair values of the intangible as sets were  determined using methodologies under the income approach based onsignificant inputs that we
re not observable. 
Unfavorable
lease
liability.
The Company has  assumed the liability of a series of ground leases for a total of approximately 11 acres of land on which the Borgataemployee
 parking garage, public space expansion, rooms expansion, and modified surface parking lot. The Company recorded an unfavorable lease liability of $1 millionin
 “Current liabilities” and $47 million in “Other long-term obligations” for the excess contractual lease obligations over the market value of the leases, which will beamortized
 on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease contracts through December 2070. Both a market and income approach using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs wereutilized to determine the fair val
ue of these leases.     
Deferred

taxes.
The  Company recorded an additional net deferred tax liability of $89 million, of which $82 million and $7 million was recorded to income taxexpense
 and goodwill, respectively. The net deferred tax liability represents the excess of the financial reporting amounts of the net assets of Borgata over their respectivebasis under U.S. and New Jersey tax law expect
ed to be applied to taxable income in the periods such differences are expected to be realized. 
Consolidated
results.
Borgata’s  net revenue for the period from August 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 was $348 million, operating  income was $39 million and net income was 
$8 million .

 a gain on the sale of Crystals of $400 million and the Company recognized a $401 million gain, which included $200 million representing its 50% share of thegain
 recorded  by  CityCenter  and  $201  million  representing  the  reversal  of  certain  basis  differences.  The  basis  differences  primarily  related  to  other-than-temporaryimpairment charges p
reviously recorded on the Company’s investment in CityCenter that were allocated to Crystals’ building assets.

credit
facility.
CityCenter’s  senior secured credit facility consisted of a $75 million revolving credit facility, maturing in October 2018 and a $1.2billion
 term  loan B facility  maturing  in October  2020. CityCenter  used cash on hand to permanently  repay  $266 million  of the term  loan B facility  during 2016. On January
 27, 2017, CityCenter completed an amendment to re-price its $1.2 billion term loan B senior credit facility and re-price and extend its $75 million revolvingfacility.
 The term loan B facility was re-priced at par and will now bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75% which  represents a 50 basis pointreduction
 compared to the prior rate and a 25 basis point reduction compared to the prior LIBOR floor . The  revolving facility was re-priced at LIBOR plus 2.00%, which represents
 a 175 basis point reduction compared to the prior rate .  The revolving facility was also extended to July 2020. All other principal provisions of the existingcredit facility remain unchanged.
 
Borgata

As
 discussed  in Note  4, the  Company acquired  Boyd Gaming’s  ownership interest  in Borgata  on August  1, 2016,  and therefore  began to  consolidate  Borgatabeginning on that date. Prior th
ereto, the Company’s investment in Borgata was accounted for under the equity method. 
Grand
Victoria
 
At
 December 31, 2015, the Company reviewed the carrying value of its Grand Victoria investment for impairment due to a greater than anticipated decline inoperating
 results due in part to a continued loss of market share to video gaming terminals, as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows compared to the prior forecast.The
 Company  used  a  blended  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  and  guideline  public  company  method  to  determine  the  estimated  fair  value  from  a  market  participant’sviewpoint.
 Key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures, a long-termgrowth
 rate of 2% and a discount rate of 10.5%. Key assumptions in the guideline public company method included business enterprise value multiples selected based onthe
 range  of  multiples  in  Grand  Victoria’s  peer  group.  As  a  result  of  the  analysis,  the  Company  determined  that  it  was  necessary  to  record  an  other-than-temporaryimpairment
 charge of $17 million at December 31, 2015, based on an estimated fair value of $123 million for the Company’s 50% interest. The Company performed asensitivity analysis
 surrounding its long-term growth rate assumption and noted that if a long-term growth rate of 1.5% had been used, the resulting estimated fair value ofthe Company’s
 50% interest in Grand Victoria would have been approximately $120 million. The Company intends to, and believes it will be able to, retain its investmentin
 Grand  Victoria;  however,  due  to  the  extent  of  the  shortfall  and  the  Company’s  assessment  of  the  uncertainty  of  fully  recovering  its  investment,  the  Company  hasdetermined that the 
impairment was other-than-temporary.     
At
 June 30, 2014, the Company reviewed the carrying value of its Grand Victoria investment for impairment due to a greater than anticipated decline in operatingresults
 and loss of market share due to the proliferation of video gaming terminals in the Illinois market, as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows compared to theprior
 forecast. The Company used a blended discounted cash flow analysis and guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value from a marketparticipant’s
 viewpoint. Key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures, along-term growth
 rate of 2% and a discount rate of 10.5%. Key assumptions in the guideline public company method included business enterprise value multiples selectedbased
 on  the  range  of  multiples  in  Grand  Victoria’s  peer  group.  As  a  result  of  the  analysis,  the  Company  determined  that  it  was  necessary  to  record  an  other-than-temporary impairm
ent charge of $29 million at June 30, 2014, based on an estimated fair value of $140 million for the Company’s 50% interest.

 and recorded a gain of $20 million. The Company’s investment in Silver Legacy was not classified as discontinued operations because the Company concludedthat the sale would not have a 
major effect on the Company’s operations or its financial results and it did not represent a disposal of a major geographic segment or productline.

Goodwill
 concerning domestic resorts relates to the acquisition of Mirage Resorts in 2001, the acquisition of Mandalay Resort Group in 2005, and the acquisitionof
 Borgata  in  August  2016.  See  Note  4  for  goodwill  recognized  in  connection  with  the  Borgata  transaction. The  Company  recognized  goodwill  resulting  from  itsacquisition of a control
ling interest in MGM China in 2011.During
 the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company conducted its annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of its reporting units, including its MGMChina
 reporting unit. The step one goodwill analysis of the MGM China reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4%. The decrease in fairvalue
 resulted from a decrease in forecasted cash flows based on then current market conditions and a sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples of the MGMChina reporting unit as well as 
the multiples of the reporting unit’s peer group.As
 a result of the indication of impairment from its step one analysis, the Company performed a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss. Assuch,
 the Company determined the fair values of all assets of the MGM China reporting unit, including its separately identifiable intangible assets. The fair values of eachof
 the  separately  identifiable  intangible  assets  exceeded  their  respective  carrying  values  by  a  significant  amount,  leading  to  a  lower  implied  fair  value  of  goodwill.Therefore, the Company reco
rded a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to reduce the historical carrying value of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit toits implied fair value. The
 carrying value of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit as of December 31, 2015 following the impairment charge was $1.4 billion.Indefinite-lived

intangible
assets.
The  Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of development rights in Detroit, trademarks and licenserights, of which $210 million consis
ts of trademarks and trade names related to the Mandalay Resort Group acquisition and $83 million related to the Borgata trade name.MGM
Grand
Paradise
gaming
subconcession.
Pursuant to the agreement dated June 19, 2004 between MGM Grand Paradise and Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A.,
 a gaming subconcession was acquired by MGM Grand Paradise for the right to operate casino games of chance and other casino games for a period of 15 yearscommencing
 on April 20, 2005. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the gaming subconcession will be extended beyond the original terms of the agreement;however, management believes that the
 gaming subconcession will be extended, given that the Cotai land concession agreement with the government extends significantlybeyond
 the gaming subconcession. As such, the Company is amortizing the gaming subconcession intangible asset on a straight-line basis over the term of the Cotai landconcession, ending in January 2038.  
MGM

Macau
land
concession.
MGM  Grand Paradise entered into a contract with the Macau government to use the land under MGM Macau commencing fromApril 6, 2006. The
 land use right has an initial term through April 6, 2031, subject to renewal for additional periods. The land concession intangible asset is amortized on astraight-line basis over t
he remaining initial contractual term.Customer

lists.
The  Company  recognized  an  intangible  asset  related  to  MGM  China’s  customer  lists,  which  was  amortized  on  an  accelerated  basis  over  itsestimated useful life of five 
years. The MGM China customer list intangible asset became fully amortized89

 in
 2016. The Company recognized an intangible asset related to the Borgata customer list, which is  amortized on an accelerated basis over its estimated useful life of twoyears and five months.
Gaming
licenses.
The  Company was granted a license to operate a casino in Maryland. The consideration paid to the State of Maryland for the license fee of $22million
 is considered a finite-lived intangible asset that is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years, beginning in December 2016, when the casinostarted operations. The Company was g
ranted a license to operate a casino in Massachusetts. The consideration paid to the State of Massachusetts for the license fee of $85million is considered a 
finite-lived intangible asset that will be amortized over a period of 15 years beginning upon the opening of the casino resort.Other.
The  Company’s other finite–lived intangible assets consist primarily of lease acquisition costs amortized over the life of the related leases, and certainlicense rights amortized over
 their contractual life.  Total
 amortization expense related to intangible assets was $180 million, $199 million and $232 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Estimated futureamortization is as fo

 in an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.75%. Both the term loan A facility and the  revolving  facility  will mature in April 2021. The term loan A facility issubject to amortization of
 principal in equal quarterly installments (commencing with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017), with 5.0% of the initial aggregate principalamount of the term loan A f
acility to be payable each year. No amounts have been drawn on the revolving credit91

 facility. The Company incurred
 a loss on early retirement of its prior credit facility of approximately $28 million recorded in “Other, net” in the consolidated statements ofoperations. At December 
31, 2016, the interest rate on the term loan A facility was 3.02%. 
The
 amended and restated credit agreement contains representations and warranties, customary events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants,including
 that the Company maintain compliance with a maximum total net leverage ratio, a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.The Company was in compliance with i
ts credit agreement covenants at December 31, 2016.

 amended and restated credit agreement is secured by (i) a mortgage on the real properties comprising the MGM Grand Las Vegas and the Bellagio, (ii) apledge
 of substantially all existing and future personal property of the subsidiaries of the Company that own the MGM Grand Las Vegas and the Bellagio; and (iii) apledge of the equity or li
mited liability company interests of the entities that own MGM Grand Las Vegas and the Bellagio.

In  April 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into a credit agreement comprised of a $300 million seniorsecured
 term loan A facility, a $1.85 billion senior secured term loan B facility, and a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The term loan B facility wasoriginally issued at 99.75% to initial lenders. The revolving credit
 facility and term loan A facility bear interest determined by reference to a total net leverage ratio pricinggrid
 which results in an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.25% to 2.75%. On October 26, 2016 the term loan B facility was re-priced at par and bore interest at LIBOR plus2.75%,
 with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%, which represented a 50 basis point reduction compared to the prior rate. In addition, the Operating Partnership received a furtherreduction
 in pricing to LIBOR plus 2.50%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75% as a result of it achieving a minimum corporate family rating of Ba3/BB- in February 2017. Allother

Notes.
On  August 19, 2016, the Company issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2026 for net proceeds of $493million.
 I n  September 2016, t he  Company used the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to redeem the $743 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its7.625%
 senior notes due 2017. T he  Company incurred a loss on early retirement of the 7.625% senior notes of approximately $16 million recorded in “Other, net” in theconsolidated
 statements of operations. In  connection with the closing of the IPO, on May 25, 2016 (the “Redemption Date”) the Company redeemed for cash all $1.23billion
 aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and 10% senior notes due 2016 in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture.The Company incurred a loss on ear
ly retirement of such notes of approximately $22 million recorded in “Other, net” in the consolidated statements of operations. 
In 2015,
 the Company repaid its $875 million 6.625% senior notes at maturity. The senior notes are unsecured and otherwise rank equally in right of payment withthe
 Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness. The senior notes are effectively subordinated to the Company’s existing and future secured obligations, primarilyconsisting of its senior cr
edit facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations. 
Bridge

Facilities.
In  connection with the Borgata transaction in August 2016, the Company borrowed $545 million under certain bridge facilities, which weresubsequently
 contributed to the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of cash on hand and a draw down on itsrevolving credit
 facility, which it subsequently refinanced with proceeds from its offering of its 4.5% senior notes due 2026. In connection with the closing of the IPO, theCompany
 borrowed $4.0 billion under certain bridge facilities, the proceeds of which were used to repay its outstanding obligations under its prior senior credit facilityand were used
 to repay its 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and its 10% senior notes due 2016 on the Redemption Date. The bridge facilities were subsequently assumed by theOperating
 Partnership  pursuant  to  the  master  contribution  agreement. The  Operating  Partnership  repaid  the  bridge  facilities  with  a  combination  of  proceeds  from  itsfinancing transactions d
escribed in Note 1 and the proceeds from the IPO.

DERIVATIVES
AND
HEDGING
ACTIVITIES 
The
 Operating Partnership uses derivative instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate volatility inherent in its variable rate debt, which could unfavorablyimpact its future e
arnings and forecasted cash flows. The Operating Partnership does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. 
In
 December 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan Bfacility.
 These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and have a notional value of $500 million and mature on November 30, 2021. The weighted averagefixed rate paid is 1.825%, and 
the variable rate received resets monthly to the one-month LIBOR subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%.

As
 of December 31, 2016, all of the interest rate swaps were valued in net unrealized gain positions and recognized as asset balances within “Other long-termassets,
 net.” For the year ended December 31, 2016, the amount recorded in other comprehensive income related to the gain on derivative instruments was $2 million. Forthe
 year ended December 31, 2016, there was no ineffective portion of the change in fair value derivatives. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recordedinterest expense of $0.4 mi
llion related to the swap agreements. 
Amounts
 reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on ourvariable-rate deb
t. During the twelve months beginning January 1, 2017, the Company estimates that $4 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense. 
In January 2017, the Operating Partn
ership entered into additional interest rate swap agreements through November 2021 with a total $700 million notional amountto
 pay a fixed rate of 1.964%, and the variable rate received resets monthly to the one-month LIBOR, subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%, in order to mitigate the interestrate risk inherent in

Income
 generated  from  gaming  operations  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  which  is  owned  by  MGM  China,  is  exempted  from  Macau’s  12%  complementary  tax,pursuant
 to approval from the Macau government. Absent this exemption, “Net income attributable to MGM Resorts International” would have decreased by $25 millionin
 2016, and “Net loss attributable to MGM Resorts International” would have increased by $25 million in 2015 and net income per share (diluted) would have decreasedby $0.04 in 2016 and net loss per share (di
luted) would have increased by $0.04 in 2015. 
Non-gaming operations
 remain subject to the Macau complementary tax. MGM Grand Paradise had at December 31, 2016 a complementary tax net operating losscarryforward of $593 mill
ion resulting from non-gaming operations that will expire if not utilized against non-gaming income in years 2017 through 2019. 
MGM
 Grand Paradise’s exemption from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits to MGMChina.
 However,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  has  an  agreement  with  the  Macau  government  to  settle  the  12%  complementary  tax  that  would  otherwise  be  due  by  itsshareholder,
 MGM China, on distributions of its gaming profits by paying a flat annual payment (“annual fee arrangement”) regardless of the amount of distributabledividends.
 Such annual fee arrangement was effective until December 31, 2016. MGM China was not subject to the complementary tax on distributions it received duringthe
 covered period as a result of the annual fee arrangement. Annual payments of $2 million were required under the annual fee arrangement. The $2 million annualpayments
 for  2016  and  2015  were  accrued  and  a  corresponding  provision  for  income  taxes  was  recorded  in  each  year.  MGM  Grand  Paradise  intends  to  file  for  anextension of this agreem
ent in the first quarter of 2017.96

 However, no assurance can be given th
at an extension will be granted or that the terms if granted will not be less favorable than the prior ag reement.  
The
 Company  repatriated  $53  million  and  $304  million  of  foreign  earnings  and  profits  in  2016  and  2015,  respectively.  At  December  31,  2016,  there  wereapproximately
 $363 million of unrepatriated foreign earnings and profits, all of which the Company anticipates will be repatriated without the incurrence of additionalU.S. income
 tax expense due to creditable foreign taxes associated with such earnings and profits. Such foreign taxes consist of the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which theCompany
 believes qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. income taxes. Accordingly, no deferred tax liability had been recorded forthose
 earnings. The Company had foreign tax credit carryovers of $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2016 which will expire as follows: $731 million in 2022; $976 millionin 2023; $786 million in 2024; and $331 mi
llion in 2025. The foreign tax credit carryovers are subject to valuation allowance as described further below. 
For state income tax
 purposes, the Company had Illinois, New Jersey, and Michigan net operating loss carryforwards of $93 million, $166 million, and $77 millionat
 December 31, 2016, respectively, which equates to deferred tax assets after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance, of $5 million, $3 million, and $3 million,respectively.
 The Illinois net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2021 through 2026. The New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards will expire ifnot utilized by 2029 through 2036. The Mich
igan net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2022 through 2024. 
The
 Company recorded a valuation allowance of $2.5 billion against the $2.8 billion foreign tax credit deferred tax asset at December 31, 2016. In addition, therewas a
 $3 million valuation allowance, after federal effect, provided on certain state deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance of $71 million on certain Macau deferred taxassets,
 and a valuation allowance of $2 million on Hong Kong net operating losses because the Company believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than not”criteria for recognition.
 
The
 foreign tax credits are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. Because MGM Grand Paradise ispresently exempt from 
the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, the Company believes that payment of the Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a tax paidin
 lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. taxes. On September 7, 2016, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an additional extension of the complementary taxexemption through March 31, 2020, concu
rrent with the end of the term of its current gaming subconcession. A competitor of MGM Grand Paradise subsequently receivedan
 additional extension of its exemption through March 31, 2020, which also runs concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming concession. Based upon thesedevelopments
 and the uncertainty concerning taxation after the concession renewal process, the Company has concluded that it can no longer assume that MGM GrandParadise will
 be entitled to additional exemption periods beyond the end of the extension recently granted. Thus, for all periods beyond March 31, 2020, the Company hasassumed
 that MGM Grand Paradise will pay the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not be able to credit the Macau Special Gaming Tax insuch
 years, and has factored that assumption into the assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset. This change resulted in a reduction in thevaluation
 allowance against the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset in the amount of $169 million  with a corresponding reduction in the provision for income taxes in2016.  
 
Due
 to improvements in its U.S. operations, the Company has generated U.S. operating profits for the past eight consecutive quarters and as of June 30, 2016 nolonger
 had cumulative U.S. losses in recent years. Consequently, during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 the Company began to rely on future U.S. source operatingincome
 in  assessing  future  foreign  tax  credit  realization  during  the  10-year  foreign  tax  credit  carryover  period.  This  change  resulted  in  a  reduction  in  the  valuationallowance and a corresponding 
reduction in the provision for income taxes of $85 million in 2016.

eginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The
 Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company accrued less than $1 million ininterest
 related to unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 and 2015. No amounts were accrued for penalties as of either date. Income tax expense for the yearsended
 December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes interest benefit and expense related to unrecognized tax benefits as follows: less than $1 million expense in 2016, $4million benefit in 2015, and $13 
million benefit in 2014. 
The Company files income tax 
returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paidin
 foreign jurisdictions are not material. As of December 31, 2016, the Company is no longer subject to examination of its U.S. consolidated federal income tax returnsfiled
 for years ended prior to 2010. During 2016, the IRS opened an examination of the Company’s 2014 U.S. consolidated federal income tax return and notified theCompany that it would open an examin
ation of the 2014 income tax return of CityCenter Holdings, LLC, an unconsolidated affiliate treated as a partnership for income taxpurposes.
 During 2015, the Company received final approval from the Joint Committee on Taxation of the results of the IRS examination of the 2009 tax year and agreedto
 all IRS adjustments to the 2010 and 2011 tax years of CityCenter Holdings, LLC. The Company received a refund of $16 million of taxes and associated interest inconnection
 with  the  settlement  of  these  examinations,  which  are  now  considered  settled  for  financial  accounting  purposes.  During  2014,  the  Company  received  finalapproval
 from the Joint Committee on Taxation of the results of the IRS examination of its consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2005 through 2009 tax years;the
 2007 through 2008 tax years of CityCenter Holdings, LLC; the 2008 through 2009 tax years of MGM Grand Detroit, LLC, a subsidiary treated as a partnership forincome tax purposes; and the 2005 through 20
09 tax years of Marina District Development Holding Company, LLC, an unconsolidated affiliate treated as a partnership forincome
 tax purposes during such years. These examinations are now considered settled for financial reporting purposes. The Company previously deposited $30 millionwith the IRS to cover the expect
ed cash taxes and interest resulting from the tentatively agreed adjustments for these examinations. 
As of December 31, 2016, other
 than adjustments resulting from the federal income tax audits discussed above, the Company was no longer subject to examinationof
 its  various  state  and  local  tax  returns  filed  for  years  ended  prior  to  2012.  During  2015,  the  state  of  New  Jersey  completed  its  examination  of  Marina  DistrictDevelopment
 Holding Company, LLC for the 2003 through 2009 tax years. All adjustments were agreed to by the members of Marina District Development HoldingCompany,
 LLC and the examination is now considered settled for financial accounting purposes. The Company made a $1 million payment of tax and associated interestas a result of this settleme
nt. No other state or local income tax returns are currently under examination. 
The Company does not anticipate 
that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 will change materially within the next twelve months.

The
 table above excludes the Company’s future lease obligations to a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership pursuant to the master lease agreement discussed inNote 19.
 The Company owns 76.3% of the Operating Partnership units as of December 31, 2016. The current obligations of $9 million under capital leases due within oneyear
 are  included  in  “Other  accrued  liabilities”  and  the  long-term  obligations  of  $5  million  under  capital  leases  due  after  one  year  are  included  in  “Other  long-termobligations”. Rental expense for operatin
g leases was $80 million, $74 million and $65 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Amounts included short term rentalscharged to rent expense. Rent
al expense in 2016, 2015, and 2014 includes $7 million related to the Cotai land concession. The98

 Company
 accounts for the Cotai land concession contract as an operating lease for which the required upfront payments are amortized over the initial 25-year contractterm. Rent recognized fo
r the Cotai land concession is included in “P reopening and start-up expens es” prior to opening. 
In
 August 2016, in connection with the Borgata transaction, the  Company has assumed the liability of a series of ground leases for a total of approximately 11acres
 of land on which the Borgata employee parking garage, public space expansion, rooms expansion, and modified surface parking lot. The Company recorded anunfavorable
 lease liability for the excess contractual lease obligations over the market value of the leases, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term ofthe
 lease contracts through December 2070. The ground lease is accounted for as an operating lease with rental expense of $2 million for the year ended December 31,2016.
 
In April 2013, the Company entered in
to a ground lease agreement for an approximate 23 acre parcel of land in connection with the MGM National Harbor project.The
 ground lease has an initial term of 25 years and the right to extend for up to 13 additional six year periods with the first 7 of those additional periods considered to bereasonably
 assured. The Company therefore amortizes the lease on a straight line basis over a 67 year term. The  ground lease is accounted for as an operating lease withrental
 expense of $16 million, $19 million and $13 million recorded for  the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Rent  recognized for the groundlease was included in "Preopening

On February 15, 2017, Borgata, the Department of Community Affairs of the State of New Jersey and Atlantic City entered into an agreement wherein Borgata will be reimbursed $72 millio
n as settlement for property tax refunds subject to certain terms and conditions. The paymentof the
 settlement amount is in satisfaction of existing New Jersey Tax Court and Superior Court judgments totaling approximately $106 million, plus interest for the 2009-2012 tax
 years and the settlement of pending tax appeals for the tax years 2013-2015. Those pending tax appeals could potentially have resulted in Borgata being awardedadditional
 refunds  due amounting  to approximately  $65 million.  Under the  terms  of  the agreement,  Atlantic  City  will pay  Borgata  the  reimbursement  amount  of $72million
 in up to two installments, with the first installment of $52 million due on or before July 31, 2017 and the second installment for the remaining balance of $20million due on or before Octob

 bonds to pay the reimbursement. Should Atlantic City fail to pay either of the installment payments or petition for relief from creditors under state or federal law, orshould any
 other event occur that would cause termination of the agreement, Borgata will be entitled to enforce a consent judgment that is being entered into as part of thesettlement for the 2009
-2015 tax years in an amount totaling $158 million. 
As part of
 the purchase and sale agreement, the Company agreed to pay Boyd Gaming half of any net amount received by the Company as it relates to the propertytax
 refund owed to Borgata. The Company will recognize the amounts received pursuant to the reimbursement agreement and amounts paid to Boyd Gaming in currentearnings in the periods in which p

Omnibus
Incentive
Plan.
The  Company’s omnibus incentive plan, as amended (the “Omnibus Plan”), allows it to grant stock options, stockappreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock units (“R
SUs”), performance share units (“PSUs”) and other stock-based awards to eligible directors, officers and employeesof the Company and its
 subsidiaries. The Omnibus Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors. The Committee hasdiscretion
 under the Omnibus Plan regarding which type of awards to grant, the vesting and service requirements, exercise price and other conditions, in all cases subjectto certain limits, including:
 
 
• As amended, the Omnibus Plan allows for th e issuance of up to 45 million shares or share-based awards; and 
• For stock options and SARs, the exercise pri ce of the award must be at least equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the maximumterm of such an award is 10 yea
rs. 
SARs
 granted under the Omnibus Plan generally have terms of seven years, and in most cases vest in four equal annual installments. RSUs granted vest ratablyover
 four years, a portion of which are subject to achievement of a performance target based on operational results compared to budget in order for such RSUs to beeligible
 to  vest.  Expense  is  recognized  primarily  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  vesting  period  of  the  awards,  net  of  estimated  forfeitures.  Estimated  forfeitures  areupdated periodically wit
h actual forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate. 
PSUs granted vest subject
 to a market condition, in which a percentage of the target award granted vests based on the performance of the Company’s stock price inrelation
 to the target price at the end of a three year performance period. Specifically, the ending average stock price must equal the target price, which is defined as 125%of the beginning average
 stock price, in order for the target award to vest. No shares are issued unless the ending average stock price is at least 60% of the target price, andthe
 maximum payout is capped at 160% of the target award. If the ending average stock price is at least 60% or more of the target price, then the amount of units grantedin
 the target award is multiplied by the stock performance multiplier. The stock performance multiplier equals the ending average stock price divided by the target price.For this
 purpose, the target and ending prices are based on the average closing price of the Company’s common stock over the 60 calendar day periods ending on the grantdate
 and  the  third  anniversary  of  the  grant  date,  respectively.  Expense  is  recognized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  performance  period  beginning  on  the  date  of  grant.Estimated forfeitures are update
d periodically with actual forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate.

Omnibus
Incentive
Plan.
The  Company’s subsidiary, MGP, adopted an omnibus incentive plan in 2016 for grants of share-based
 awards to eligible directors, officers and employees of MGP and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including the Company (“MGP Omnibus Plan”). The MGP OmnibusPlan
 is administered by MGP’s Board of Directors, which has the discretion to determine the type of awards to grant, the vesting and service requirements, exercise priceand other conditions, in all 
cases subject to certain limits, including: 
 
• The MGP Omnibus Plan allows for the issuance of up to 2.5 million shares; and 
• Limits  the maximum amount of shares to be granted, in the aggregate, to any individual participant within any fiscal year as well as limits the maximumaggregate grant date v
alue (regardless of type(s) of award granted) in any fiscal year to any non-employee director of MGP.The
 majority  of  RSUs  granted  under  the  MGP  Omnibus  Plan  vest  ratably  over  four  years  with  the  exception  of  RSUs  issued  to  MGM  Resorts  Internationalemployees
 in connection with the IPO, which vest ratably over one year. Expense is recognized on a straight-line  basis over the vesting period of the awards, net ofestimated
 forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures are updated periodically with actual forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate. The RSUs aregranted together with divid
end equivalent rights that are subject to the same vesting and forfeiture terms as the underlying RSUs. 
Outstanding
 PSUs granted under the MGP Omnibus Plan vest subject to a market condition, in which a percentage of the target award granted vests based onMGP’s
 total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to a select group of peer companies at the end of a three year performance period. Depending on MGP’s relative TSR atthe
 end of the performance period, anywhere from 0% to 160% of the target award may vest. Should MGP’s TSR be negative during the performance period, then themaximum portion of the target award eligible for vesting is capped at 100%. Ex
pense is recognized on a graded basis over the performance period beginning on the date ofgrant.
 Estimated forfeitures are updated periodically with actual forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate. The PSUs are granted togetherwith dividend equivalent righ
ts that are subject to the same vesting and forfeiture terms as the underlying PSUs. 
As of
 December 31, 2016, MGP had an aggregate of 2 million shares of common stock available for grant as share-based awards under the MGP Omnibus Plan. Asummary of the activi

BENEFIT
PLANS 
Multi-employer

benefit
plans.
Employees  of  the  Company  who  are  members  of  various  unions  are  covered  by  union-sponsored,  collectively  bargained,multiemployer
 health and welfare and defined benefit pension plans. Of these plans, the Company considers the Southern Nevada Culinary and Bartenders Pension Plan(the “Pension Plan”), under the 
terms of collective bargaining agreements with the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas for and on behalf of Culinary Workers UnionLocal
 No. 226 and Bartenders Union Local No. 165, to be individually significant. The risk of participating in the Pension Plan differs from single-employer plans in thefollowing aspects:
 
 
a) Assets contributed to the mul tiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; 
b) If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; 
c) If  an  entity  chooses  to  stop  participating  in  some  of  its  multiemployer  plans,  the  entity  may  be  required  to  pay  those  plans  an  amount  based  on  theunderfunded status of the plan, 
referred to as a withdrawal liability; and 
d) If  the Pension Plan is terminated by withdrawal of all employers and if the value of the nonforfeitable benefits exceeds plan assets and withdrawal liabilitypayments, employers are re
quired by law to make up the insufficient difference. 
Pursuant
 to its collective bargaining agreements referenced above, the Company also contributes to UNITE HERE Health (the “Health Fund”), which provideshealthcare benefi
ts to its active and retired members. The Company’s participation in the Pension Plan is outlined in the table below.

(1) In  2014, the trustees of the Pension Plan elected to apply the extended amortization and the special ten-year asset smoothing rules under the Pension ReliefAct of 2010.
 
(2) The  Company is party to ten collective bargaining agreements that require contributions to the Pension Plan. The agreements between CityCenter HotelCasino, LLC, Bellagio, Ma
ndalay Corp., MGM Grand Hotel, LLC and the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas are the most significant because morethan half of the Company’s emp
loyee participants in the Pension Plan are covered by those four agreements.

Pension
 Plan contributions in 2016 increased when compared to 2015 due to the contribution rate to the Pension Plan increasing in mid-2016 as defined under thecollective
 bargaining agreements, which was partially offset by a 3% decrease in hours worked in 2016 compared to 2015. During  2014 an amendment to the collectivebargaining
 agreements to temporarily divert contributions from the Pension Plan to the Health Fund was in effect. As a result, contributions to the Pension Plan increasedin
 2015 compared to 2014 as the amendment ended in June of 2014. Bellagio,  Aria, Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas were listed in the Pension Plan’s Forms5500
 as providing more than 5% of the total contributions for the plan years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. At the date the financial statements were issued, Form5500 was not available for the p
lan year ending in 2016. No surcharges were imposed on the Company’s contributions to any of the plans. 
Borgata.
The  above  disclosures  exclude  multi-employer  defined  benefit  pension  plans  under  terms  of  collective-bargaining  agreements  that  cover  union-represented
 employees at Borgata (acquired on August 1, 2016). These unions cover certain of its culinary, hotel and other trade workers. Borgata is obligated to makedefined
 contributions under these plans and is also subject to the risks outlined above for the Company’s other multi-employer pension plans. Contributions, based onwages paid to covered employees, totaled $4 million, for the perio
d from acquisition through December 31, 2016. Borgata’s most significant plan is the Legacy Plan of theNational
 Retirement Fund, Former HEREIU and Local 54 (the “The Local 54 Pension Plan”), which has been listed in “critical status” (which means it is generally lessthan
 65% funded) and a rehabilitation plan has been adopted. As a result, the Company is responsible for the payment of surcharges in addition to the contribution ratespecified
 in the collective bargaining agreement. The Company estimates Borgata’s share of unfunded vested liabilities related to certain multi-employer pension plans isapproximately
 $288  million  as  of  January  1,  2016,  which  amount  primarily  relates  to  The  Local  54  Pension  Plan,  and  which  amount  is  subject  to  change  each  yeardepending
 on the applicable plan ’ s employer contributions, investment performance and other factors. Borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans,which
 withdrawal could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time (or over a period of time) that would varybased on a number of factors 
at the time of (and after) withdrawal. 
Self-insurance.
The  Company is self-insured for most health care benefits and workers compensation for its non-union employees. The liability for health careclaims
 filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported was $30 million and $22 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The workers compensationliability for cla
ims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported was $53 million and $43 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Both liabilitiesare included in “Other a
ccrued liabilities.” 
Retirement

savings
plans.
The  Company has retirement savings plans under Section 401(k) of the IRC for eligible employees. The plans allow employees todefer, within
 prescribed limits, up to 75% of their income on a pre-tax and/or after-tax basis through contributions to the plans. The Company matches 50% of the first 6%of
 eligible employee deferrals up to a specified annual maximum dollar amount. The Company recorded charges for 401(k) contributions of $20 million, $16 million and$17 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respect
ively. 
The
 Company maintains nonqualified deferred retirement plans for certain key employees. The plans allow participants to defer, on a pre-tax basis, a portion oftheir
 salary and bonus and accumulate tax deferred earnings, plus investment earnings on the deferred balances, as a deferred tax savings. All employee deferrals vestimmediately. The Company does no
t contribute to the plan. 
The
 Company also maintains  nonqualified  supplemental  executive retirement  plans (“SERP”) for certain key employees.  Until September 2008, the Companymade
 quarterly contributions intended to provide a retirement benefit that is a fixed percentage of a participant’s estimated final five-year average annual salary, up to amaximum
 of 65%. The Company has indefinitely  suspended these contributions.  Employees do not make contributions  under these plans. A portion of the Companycontributions and investment

SEGMENT
INFORMATION
The
 Company’s  management  views  each  of  its  casino  resorts  as  an  operating  segment.  Operating  segments  are  aggregated  based  on  their  similar  economiccharacteristics,
 types  of  customers,  types  of  services  and  products  provided,  the  regulatory  environments  in  which  they  operate,  and  their  management  and  reportingstructure.
 The Company’s principal operating activities occur in two geographic regions: the United States and Macau S.A.R. The Company has aggregated its operationsinto
 two  reportable  segments  based  on  the  similar  characteristics  of  the  operating  segments:  domestic  resorts  and  MGM China.  The  Company’s  operations  related  toinvestments
 in  unconsolidated  affiliates  and  certain  other  corporate  operations  and  management  services  have  not  been  identified  as  separate  reportable  segments;therefore, these oper
ations are included in “Corporate and other” in the following segment disclosures to reconcile to consolidated results.The
 Company’s  management  utilizes  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  as  the  primary  profit  measure  for  its  reportable  segments.  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  is  ameasure
 defined as Adjusted EBITDA before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the Omnibus Plan and the MGP Omnibus Plan, which are notallocated
 to the reportable segments or each operating segment, as applicable. MGM China recognizes stock compensation expense related to the MGM China Plan whichis
 included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for MGM China. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income(expense),
 taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, NV Energy exit expense, gain on Borgata transaction, goodwill impairment charges,and property transactions, n
et.108

MGP
 
Pursuant
 to a master lease agreement by and between a subsidiary of the Company (the “Tenant”) and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the “Landlord”),the
 Tenant has leased the contributed real estate assets from the Landlord. The master lease has an initial lease term of ten years with the potential to extend the term forfour
 additional five-year terms thereafter at the option of the Tenant. The master lease provides that any extension of its term must apply to all of the real estate under themaster
 lease at the time of the extension. The master lease has a triple-net structure, which requires the Tenant to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease,including
 real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the base rent. Additionally, the master lease provides the Landlord with a right offirst offer with respect to MGM National Harbor and the Company’s develo
pment property located in Springfield, Massachusetts, which the Landlord may exercise shouldthe Company elect to sell 
these properties in the future. 
Subsequent
 to the Company completing its acquisition of Borgata on August 1, 2016, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from a subsidiary of the Company inexchange
 for  MGP’s  assumption  of  $545  million  of  indebtedness  and  the  issuance  of  27.4  million  Operating  Partnership  units  to  a  subsidiary  of  the  Company.  Inconnection with this transa
ction, the Tenant and Landlord entered into an amendment to the master lease to include the Borgata real property. 
The
 annual rent payments due under the master lease were $550 million prior to MGP’s acquisition of Borgata’s real property on August 1, 2016. Subsequent tothe acquisition,
 annual rent payments under the master lease increased to $650 million, prorated for the remainder of the first lease year after the Borgata transaction. Rentunder
 the master lease consists of a “base rent” component and a “percentage rent” component. For the first year, the base rent will represent 90% of the initial total rentpayments due under the master lease and the
 percentage rent will represent 10% of the initial total rent payments due under the master lease. The base rent includes a fixedannual
 rent escalator of 2.0% for the second through the sixth lease years (as defined in the master lease). Thereafter, the annual escalator of 2.0% will be subject to theTenant and, without duplication, the o
perating subsidiary sublessees of the Tenant, collectively meeting an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio of 6.25:1.00 based on their netrevenue from
 the leased properties subject to the master lease (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, adjusted to exclude net revenueattributable
 to certain scheduled subleases and, at the Company’s option, reimbursed cost revenue). The percentage rent will initially be a fixed amount for approximatelythe
 first  six  years  and  will  then  be  adjusted  every  five  years  based  on  the  average  actual  annual  net  revenues  of  the  Tenant  and,  without  duplication,  the  operatingsubsidiary
 sublessees of the Tenant, from the leased properties subject to the master lease at such time for the trailing five calendar-year period (calculated by multiplyingthe
 average annual net revenues, excluding net revenue attributable to certain scheduled subleases and, at the Landlord’s option, reimbursed cost revenue, for the trailingfive calendar-yea
r period by 1.4%). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company made rent payments to the Landlord in the amount of $418 million. 
Pursuant
 to the master lease, upon an event of default the Landlord may, at its option (i) terminate the master lease, repossess any leased property, relet any leasedproperty
 to a third party and require that the Tenant pay damages; (ii) require that the Tenant pay to the Landlord rent and other sums payable with interest calculated atthe
 overdue rate provided for in the master lease or terminate the Tenant’s right to possession of the leased property and seek damages; and/or (iii) seek any and all otherrights and remedies
111

 available
 under law or in equity. An event of default will b e  deemed to occur upon certain events, including: (1) the failure by the Tenant to pay rent or other additionalcharges
 when due; (2) failure by the Tenant to comply with the covenants set forth in the master lease; (3) certain events of bankruptcy or inso lvency  with respect to aTenant
 or the guarantor; (4) the occurrence of a default under the guaranty of the master lease; (5) the loss or suspension of a material license that causes cessation ofgaming
 activity that would reasonably be expected to have a material  adverse effect on the Tenant, the facilities or the leased properties taken as a whole; and (6) thefailure
 of  the  Company,  on  a  consolidated  basis  with  Tenant,  to  maintain  an  EBITDAR  to  rent  ratio  (as  described  in  the  master  lease)  of  at  least  1. 10:1.00  for twoconsecutive test periods, b
eginning with the test periods ending December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants asof December 31, 2016.
Pursuant
 to  a  corporate  services  agreement,  the  Company  provides  MGP  and  its  subsidiaries  with  financial,  administrative  and  operational  support  services,including

DESCRIPTION
OF
REGULAT
ION
AND
LICENSING 
The
 gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations.  Each of our casinos is subject toextensive
 regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located.  These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the responsibility,financial
 stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations.  Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could resultin disciplinary action 
in other jurisdictions. 
In
 addition  to  gaming  regulations,  our  businesses  are  subject  to  various  federal,  state,  and  local  laws  and  regulations  of  the  countries  and  states  in  which  weoperate.
  These  laws  and  regulations  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  restrictions  and  conditions  concerning  alcoholic  beverages,  smoking,  environmental  matters,employment
 and immigration, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, land use, marketing and advertising, timeshare, lending, privacy, telemarketing,regulations applicabl
e under the Office of Foreign Asset Control, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations.  Suchlaws
 and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted.  Any material changes, new laws orregulations, or material difference
s in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Nevada
Government
Regulation
 
The
 ownership and operation of our casino gaming facilities in Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder(collectively,
 the  “Nevada  Act”),  and  various  local  regulations.   Our  gaming  operations  are  subject  to  the  licensing  and  regulatory  control  of  the  Nevada  GamingCommission
 (the  “Nevada  Commission”),  the  Nevada  State  Gaming Control  Board  (the  “Nevada  Board”),  and various  county  and  city  licensing  agencies  (the  “localauthorities”).  The Nevada Com
mission, the Nevada Board, and the local authorities are collectively referred to as the “Nevada Gaming Authorities.” 
The
 laws, regulations, and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, amongother things:
 
 
• the prevention of unsavory or unsui table persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; 
 
• the establishment and m aintenance of responsible accounting practices; 
 
• the  maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairsand the safeguarding of asse
ts and revenues; 
 
• providing reliable re cord keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities; 
 
• the prevention of cheat ing and fraudulent practices; and 
 
• providing a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees. 
Any change in the laws, regulations, 
and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities could have an adverse effect on our gaming operations. 
Each
 of our subsidiaries that currently operate casinos in Nevada (collectively, the “Nevada casino licensees”) is required to be licensed by the Nevada GamingAuthorities.  Each gaming li
cense requires the periodic payment of fees and taxes and is not transferable.  MGM Grand Hotel, LLC, New York-New York Hotel & Casino,LLC,
 Bellagio,  LLC,  MGM  Resorts  Manufacturing  Corp.,  and  Aria  Resort  &  Casino,  LLC  are  also  licensed  as  manufacturers  and  distributors  of  gaming  devices(collectively,
 the “Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees”).  Certain of our subsidiaries have also been licensed or found suitable as shareholders, members, orgeneral partners, as relevant, of the Nevada casino licensees and of the Nevada manufacturer and distribut
or licensees.  The Nevada casino licensees, Nevada manufacturerand distributor license
es, and the foregoing subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Nevada licensed subsidiaries.” 
We,
 along  with  Mandalay  Resort  Group,  are  required  to  be  registered  by  the  Nevada  Commission  as  publicly  traded  corporations  (collectively,  the  “Nevadaregistered
 corporations”) and Mirage Resorts, Incorporated is required to be registered as an intermediary company and, as such, each of us is required periodically tosubmit detailed finan
cial and operating reports to the Nevada 

 Commission
 and furnish any other information that the Nevada Commission may require.  No person may become a stockholder or member of, or receive any percentageof
 profits from, the Nevada licensed subsidiaries without first registering with (for equity ownership of 5% or less), or obtaining licenses and approvals from the NevadaGaming
 Authorities.  Additionally, the local authorities have taken the position that they have the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of anycorporation controlling a gaming licensee.
  The Nevada registered corporations, Mirage Resorts, Incorporated and the Nevada licensed subsidiaries have obtained from theNevada Gaming Authorities the va
rious registrations, approvals, permits, and licenses required in order to engage in gaming activities in Nevada. 
The
 Nevada  Gaming  Authorities  may  investigate  any  individual  who  has  a  material  relationship  to,  or  material  involvement  with,  the  Nevada  registeredcorporations
 or  any  of  the  Nevada  licensed  subsidiaries  to  determine  whether  such  individual  is  suitable  or  should  be  licensed  as  a  business  associate  of  a  gaminglicensee.
  Officers,  directors,  and  certain  key  employees  of  the  Nevada  licensed  subsidiaries  must  file  applications  with  the  Nevada  Gaming  Authorities  and  may  berequired
 to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities.  Officers, directors, and key employees of the Nevada registered corporations who are actively and directlyinvolved
 in the gaming activities of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities.  The NevadaGaming
 Authorities  may  deny  an  application  for  licensing  or  a  finding  of  suitability  for  any  cause  they  deem  reasonable.   A  finding  of  suitability  is  comparable  tolicensing,
 and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation.  The applicant for licensing or a finding ofsuitability,
 or the gaming licensee by which the applicant is employed or for whom the applicant serves, must pay all the costs of the investigation.  Changes in licensedpositions
 must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities, and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensure, the NevadaGaming Authorities have jurisd
iction to disapprove a change in a corporate position. 
If
 the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director, or key employee unsuitable for licensing or to continue having a relationship with the Nevadaregistered
 corporations or the Nevada licensed subsidiaries, such Nevada registered corporations or Nevada licensed subsidiaries, as applicable, would have to sever allrelationships
 with that person.  In addition, the Nevada Commission may require the Nevada registered corporations or the Nevada licensed subsidiaries to terminate theemployment
 of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  Determinations of suitability or of questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to judicialreview in Nevada.
 
The
 Nevada  registered  corporations  and  the  Nevada  casino  licensees  are  required  to  submit  detailed  financial  and  operating  reports  to  the  NevadaCommission.  Substantially all o
f the Nevada registered corporations’ and the Nevada licensed subsidiaries’ material loans, leases, sales of securities, and similar financingtransactions must be repo
rted to or approved by the Nevada Commission. 
If
 the Nevada Commission determined that we or a Nevada licensed subsidiary violated the Nevada Act, it could limit, condition, suspend, or revoke, subject tocompliance
 with  certain  statutory  and  regulatory  procedures,  our  gaming  licenses  and  those  of  the  Nevada  licensed  subsidiaries.   In  addition,  the  Nevada  registeredcorporations
 and the  Nevada licensed  subsidiaries  and the  persons involved  could be subject  to substantial  fines  for each  separate  violation  of the Nevada  Act at thediscretion
 of the Nevada Commission.  Further, a supervisor could be appointed by the Nevada Commission to operate the gaming establishments  and, under certaincircumstances, earnings generated
 during the supervisor’s appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the gaming establishments) could be forfeited to the Stateof
 Nevada.   Limitation,  conditioning,  or  suspension  of  any  gaming  license  or  the  appointment  of  a  supervisor  could  (and  revocation  of  any  gaming  license  would)materially adversely affect our gami
ng operations. 
Any beneficial holder of our vo
ting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his or hersuitability
 as a beneficial holder of the voting securities determined if the Nevada Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistentwith
 the declared policies of the State of Nevada.  The applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any suchinvestigation.
 
The
 Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of our voting securities to report the acquisition to the Nevada Commission.  TheNevada
 Act  requires  that  beneficial  owners  of  more  than  10%  of  any  class  of  our  voting  securities  apply  to  the  Nevada  Commission  for  a  finding  of  suitabilitywithin 30 days after the Chair
man of the Nevada Board mails the written notice requiring such filing.  Under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor” as defined inthe
 Nevada Act, which acquires more than 10% but not more than 25% of any class of our voting securities, may apply to the Nevada Commission for a waiver of suchfinding
 of suitability if such institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only.  An institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may, incertain circumst
ances, own up to 29% of the voting securities of a registered company for a limited period of time and maintain the waiver. 
An
 institutional investor will be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes if it acquires and holds the voting securities in the ordinary course ofbusiness
 as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of our board of directors, anychange in our corporate ch
arter, bylaws, management, policies, or 
2

 operations,
 or any of our gaming affiliates, or any other action that the Nevada Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding our voting securities for investmentpurposes only.  Activities that 
are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include: 
 
• voting on all matters vot ed on by stockholders; 
 
• making financial  and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change inits management, polic
ies, or operations; and 
 
• such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent. 
If
 the  beneficial  holder  of  voting  securities  who  must  be  found  suitable  is  a  corporation,  partnership,  or  trust,  it  must  submit  detailed  business  and  financialinformation including a 
list of beneficial owners.  The applicant is required to pay all costs of investigation. 
Any
 person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Commission or theChairman
 of the Nevada Board, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in connection with investigation of itsapplication,
 may  be  found  unsuitable.   The  same  restrictions  apply  to  a  record  owner  if  the  record  owner,  after  request,  fails  to  identify  the  beneficial  owner.   Anystockholder found unsuitable
 and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our common stock beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by theNevada Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense.  We will be su
bject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholderor to have any other rela
tionship with us or a Nevada licensed subsidiary, we or any of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries: 
 
• pays that person any dividend or in terest upon any of our voting securities; 
 
• allows that person to exerc ise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; 
 
• pays remuneration in any fo rm to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or 
 
• fails  to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his or her voting securities including if necessary, the immediate purchase ofthe voting securities for
 cash at fair market value. 
The
 Nevada Commission may, in its discretion, require the holder of any debt security of the Nevada registered corporations to file an application, be investigated,and
 be found suitable to hold the debt security.  If the Nevada Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own such security, then pursuant to the Nevada Act,the registered corpor
ation can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals, if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission, it: 
 
• pays to the unsuitable person any d ividend, interest, or any distribution whatsoever; 
 
• recognizes any voting right by su ch unsuitable person in connection with such securities; 
 
• pays the unsuitable person re muneration in any form; or 
 
• makes any payment to the unsui table person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation, or similar transaction. 
We
 are required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada that may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time.  If any securities are held intrust
 by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities.  A failure to makesuch
 disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable.  We are also required to render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficialowner.
  The Nevada Commission has the power to require the Nevada registered corporations’ stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that such securities are subjectto the Nevada Act.  However, to date, th
e Nevada Commission has not imposed such a requirement on the Nevada registered corporations. 
The
 Nevada registered corporations may not make a public offering of any securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission if the securities or theproceeds therefrom are intended to be used to construct, acquire, or finance gami
ng facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes or forsimilar purposes.  An approval, i
f given, does not 
3

 constitute
 a finding, recommendation, or approval by the Nevada Commission or the Nevada Board as to the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the investmentmerits of the securi
ties.  Any representation to the contrary is unlawful. 
On
 July 24, 2014, the Nevada Commission granted the Nevada registered corporations prior approval to make public offerings for a period of three years, subjectto certain conditions.
 
Changes
 in control of the Nevada registered corporations through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or anyact or conduct
 by a person whereby he or she obtains control may not occur without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission.  Entities seeking to acquire control of aregistered
 corporation must satisfy the Nevada Board and the Nevada Commission concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control of the registeredcorporation.
  The Nevada Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, and other persons having a material relationship or involvement withthe entity proposing to acqui
re control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction. 
The
 Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities, and corporate defensive tacticsaffecting
 Nevada gaming licensees and registered corporations that are affiliated with those operations may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming.  TheNevada
 Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada’s gaming industry and tofurther Nevada’s policy to:
 
 
• assure the financial stability  of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates; 
 
• preserve the benefic ial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and 
 
• promote a neutral environme nt for the orderly governance of corporate affairs. 
Approvals are,
 in certain circumstances, required from the Nevada Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above the currentmarket
 price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated.  The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalizationproposed
 by  a  registered  corporation’s  board  of  directors  in  response  to  a  tender  offer  made  directly  to  the  registered  corporation’s  stockholders  for  the  purpose  ofacquiring control of tha

 fees  and  taxes,  computed  in  various  ways  depending  on  the  type  of  gaming  or  activity  involved,  are  payable  to  the  State  of  Nevada  and  to  the  localauthorities.  Depending upon the pa
rticular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either monthly, quarterly, or annually and are based upon either: 
 
• a percentage of the gross revenues received; 
 
• the number of gaming devic es operated; or 
 
• the number of table gam es operated. 
The
 tax on gross revenues received is generally 6.75%.  A live entertainment tax is also paid on charges for admission to any facility where certain forms of liveentertainment ar
e provided.  The Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees also pay certain fees and taxes to the State of Nevada. 
Because we
 are involved in gaming ventures outside of Nevada, we are required to deposit with the Nevada Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in theamount
 of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation by the Nevada Board of our participation in such foreign gaming.  The revolving fund is subject to increase ordecrease
 at the discretion of the Nevada Commission.  Thereafter, we are also required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Act.  Wewould be subject to disciplina
ry action by the Nevada Commission if we: 
 
• knowingly violate any laws of the fo reign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation; 
 
• fail to conduct the for eign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations; 
 
4

  
• engage  in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects ortends to reflect disc
redit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada; 
 
• engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the State of Nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees; or 
 
• employ, contract with, or associate with any person in the  foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevada on theground of personal unsuitabili
ty, or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling. 
The
 sale of alcoholic beverages by the Nevada licensed subsidiaries is subject to licensing, control, and regulation by the applicable local authorities.  All licensesare
 revocable and are not transferable.  The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend, or revoke any such license, and any such disciplinary actioncould (and revocation would) hav
e a material adverse effect upon our operations.
Michigan
Government
Regulation
and
Taxation
 
The
 Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act (the “Michigan Act”) subjects the owners and operators of casino gaming facilities to extensive state licensingand
 regulatory requirements.  The Michigan Act also authorizes local regulation of casino gaming facilities by the City of Detroit, provided that any such local ordinancesregulating casino
 gaming are consistent with the Michigan Act and rules promulgated to implement it.  We are subject to the Michigan Act through our ownership interestin MGM Grand Detroit, LLC (the “license
d subsidiary”) which operates MGM Grand Detroit.  Our ownership interest in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC is held by our wholly-owned subsidiary MGM Grand Detroit, Inc.
 
The
 Michigan Act creates the Michigan Gaming Control Board (the “Michigan Board”) and authorizes it to grant casino licenses to not more than three applicantswho
 have entered into development agreements with the City of Detroit.  The Michigan Board is granted extensive authority to conduct background investigations anddetermine
 the suitability of casino license applicants, affiliated companies, officers, directors, or managerial employees of applicants and affiliated companies and personsor
 entities  holding  a  one  percent  or  greater  direct  or  indirect  interest  in  an  applicant  or  affiliated  company.   Institutional  investors  holding  less  than  certain  specifiedamounts
 of our debt or equity securities are exempted from meeting the suitability requirements  of the Michigan Act since we are a publicly traded corporation, andprovided that the securities were purchased for investme
nt purposes only and not for the purpose of influencing or affecting our affairs.  Any person who supplies goods orservices
 to the licensed subsidiary which are directly related to, used in connection with, or affecting gaming, and any person who supplies other goods or services to thelicensed
 subsidiary on a regular and continuing basis, must obtain a supplier’s license from the Michigan Board.  In addition, any individual employed by the licensedsubsidiary
 or by a supplier licensee whose work duties are related to or involved in the gaming operation or are performed in a restricted area or a gaming area of thelicensed subsidiary must obt
ain an occupational license from the Michigan Board. 
The
 Michigan Act imposes the burden of proof on the applicant for a casino license to establish its suitability to receive and hold the license.  The applicant mustestablish
 its  suitability  as  to  integrity,  moral  character  and  reputation,  business  probity,  financial  ability  and  experience,  responsibility,  and  other  criteria  deemedappropriate
 by the Michigan Board.  A casino license is valid for a period of one year and the Michigan Board may refuse to renew it upon a determination that thelicensee no longer meets t
he requirements for licensure. 
The
 Michigan Board may, among other things, revoke, suspend or restrict the licensed subsidiary’s casino license.  The licensed subsidiary is also subject to finesor
 forfeiture  of  assets  for  violations  of  gaming  or  liquor  control  laws  or  rules.   In  the  event  that  the  licensed  subsidiary’s  license  is  revoked  or  suspended  for  morethan
 120  days,  the  Michigan  Act  provides  for  the  appointment  of  a  conservator  who,  among  other  things,  is  required  to  preserve  the  assets  to  ensure  that  they  shallcontinue
 to be operated in a sound and businesslike manner, or upon order of the Michigan Board, to sell or otherwise transfer the assets to another person or entity whomeets the requirem
ents of the Michigan Act for licensure, subject to certain approvals and consultations. 
The
 Michigan  Board  has  adopted  administrative  rules  to  implement  the  terms  of  the  Michigan  Act.   Among  other  things,  the  rules  impose  more  detailedsubstantive and procedural 
requirements with respect to casino licensing and operations. 
Included
 are requirements regarding such things as licensing investigations and hearings, record keeping and retention, contracting, reports to the Michigan Board,internal
 control and accounting procedures, security and surveillance, extensions of credit to gaming patrons, conduct of gaming, and transfers of ownership interests inlicensed casinos.  The rules 
also establish numerous 
5

 Michigan
 Board procedures regarding licensing, disciplinary and other hearings, and similar matters.  The rules have the force of law and are binding on the MichiganBoard as well as on applicants fo
r or holders of casino licenses. 
Under rules of
 the Michigan Board, a person or company which intends to acquire shares representing more than a 5% equity interest in a publicly traded companywhich
 is the holding company of a Michigan casino licensee must obtain approval of the acquisition from the Michigan Board.  Subsequent to the acquisition, the personor
 company acquiring the shares must be determined by the Michigan Board to be “suitable” and “qualified” to own the shares.  In addition, if the acquisition is by acompany,
 “key persons” in the company (generally the officers, directors, managerial employees, and significant owners) must also be determined to be “suitable” and“qualified.”
 “Institutional investors” (as that term is defined in the Michigan Act) may generally obtain a waiver from these requirements if the institutional investor hasless
 than 15% ownership interest in the publicly traded company.  Upon attaining equity ownership of 5% or more, or filing Schedule 13D or 13G with the SEC, theMichigan Board must be notified by the investor.  Unless ot
herwise ordered by the Michigan Board, institutional investors acquiring less than 10% equity ownership in thepublicly
 traded  company  are  entitled  to  an  exemption  from  the  approval  requirements,  but  are  required  to  file  an  institutional  waiver  application  with  the  MichiganBoard.
  Institutional  investors  acquiring  10%  or  more  equity  ownership  must  apply  for  an  institutional  waiver,  supplying  certain  information  delineated  inRule
 504(3).  Pursuant to Rule 504(4), institutional investors acquiring more than 15% equity ownership must apply to the Michigan Board for approval of the acquisitionwithin 45 days after it occu
rs.  The institutional investor and its key persons may be subject to suitability and qualification determinations. 
The
 term  “institutional  investor”  includes  financial  institutions,  insurance  companies,  pension  funds,  mutual  funds,  etc.   The  shares  held  by  the  institutionalinvestor
 must be held for investment purposes only.  The following activities are deemed consistent with holding the shares for investment purposes:  voting by proxyfurnished
 by the board of directors, on all matters voted on by the holders of the voting securities; serving as a member of a committee of creditors or security holdersformed
 in  connection  with  a  debt  restructuring;  nominating  a  candidate  for  election  or  appointment  to  the  board  of  directors  in  connection  with  a  debt  restructuring;accepting
 appointment or election as a member of the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring and serving in that capacity until the conclusion of themember’s
 term; making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for information purposes and not to cause a changein its management, poli
cies, or operations; and other activities that the board determines to be consistent with the investment intent. 
The
 Michigan Liquor Control Commission licenses, controls and regulates the sale of alcoholic beverages by the licensed subsidiary pursuant to the MichiganLiquor Control Code of 1998.  The Michigan Act a
lso requires that the licensed subsidiary sell in a manner consistent with the Michigan Liquor Control Code. 
The
 Detroit City Council enacted an ordinance entitled “Casino Gaming Authorization and Casino Development Agreement Certification and Compliance.”  Theordinance
 authorizes casino gaming only by operators who are licensed by the Michigan Board and are parties to a development agreement which has been approved andcertified
 by the City Council and is currently in effect, or are acting on behalf of such parties.  The development agreement among the City of Detroit, MGM GrandDetroit,
 LLC and the Economic Development Corporation of the City of Detroit has been so approved and certified and is currently in effect.  Under the ordinance, thelicensed
 subsidiary is required to submit to the Mayor of Detroit and to the City Council periodic reports regarding its compliance with the development agreement or, inthe
 event of non-compliance, reasons for non-compliance and an explanation of efforts to comply.  The ordinance requires the Mayor of Detroit to monitor each casinooperator’s
 compliance  with  its  development  agreement,  to  take  appropriate  enforcement  action  in  the  event  of  default  and  to  notify  the  City  Council  of  defaults  andenforcement
 action taken; and, if a development agreement is terminated, it requires the City Council to transmit notice of such action to the Michigan Board within fivebusiness days
 along with Detroit’s request that the Michigan Board revoke the relevant operator’s casino license.  If a development agreement is terminated, the MichiganAct requires the Michigan Boa
rd to revoke the relevant operator’s casino license upon the request of Detroit. 
The
 administrative rules of the Michigan Board prohibit the licensed subsidiary or us from entering into a debt transaction affecting the capitalization or financialviability of MGM Grand Detroit withou
t prior approval from the Michigan Board.   
The
 Michigan Act effectively provides for a wagering tax equal to 19% of adjusted gross receipts from gaming operations conducted at a casino.  Proceeds of thewagering
 tax are shared between the State of Michigan and the City of Detroit.  In addition to the wagering tax, the Michigan Act establishes an annual municipal servicefee
 equal to the greater of $4 million or 1.25% of adjusted gross receipts to be paid to Detroit to defray its cost of hosting casinos, and an annual assessment, as adjustedannually
 based upon a consumer price index, in the initial amount of approximately $8.3 million to be paid to Michigan to defray its regulatory enforcement and othercasino-related costs. 
 These payments are in addition to the taxes, fees and assessments customarily paid by business entities situated in Detroit.  The licensed subsidiary isalso
 obligated to pay 1% of its adjusted gross receipts to Detroit, to be increased to 2% of its adjusted gross receipts in any calendar year in which adjusted gross receiptsexceed $400 million.

 Mississippi
Government
Regulation
 
We conduct
 our Mississippi gaming operations through two indirect subsidiaries, Beau Rivage Resorts, Inc., LLC operates Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi, andMGM
 Resorts Mississippi,  Inc., which operates  the Gold Strike  Casino in Tunica  County, Mississippi  (collectively,  the “casino licensees”).   The operation  of casinofacilities
 in Mississippi is subject to extensive state and local regulation, but primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission and theMississippi Department of Revenu
e. 
The
 Mississippi Gaming Control Act (the “Mississippi Act”) legalized casino gaming in Mississippi.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted regulations infurtherance of the Miss
issippi Act.  The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of Mississippi and the Mississippi Gaming Commission seek to: 
 
• prevent unsavory or unsuitable p ersons from having any direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; 
 
• establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures; 
 
• maintain  effective control over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and safeguarding ofassets and revenues, providing r
eliable record keeping and making periodic reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission; 
 
• prevent cheating and fr audulent practices; 
 
• provide a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees; and 
 
• ensure that gaming lic ensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents. 
The
 regulations  are  subject  to  amendment  and  interpretation  by  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.   Changes  in  Mississippi  law  or  the  regulations  or  theMississippi
 Gaming Commission’s interpretations thereof may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted, and could have a materialadverse effect on us and our M
ississippi gaming operations. 
The
 Mississippi Act provides for legalized gaming at the discretion of the 14 counties that either border the Gulf Coast or the Mississippi River, but only if thevoters in
 such counties have not voted to prohibit gaming in that county.  As of December 31, 2016, gaming was permissible in nine of the 14 eligible counties in the stateand
 gaming operations had commenced in Adams, Coahoma, Hancock, Harrison, Tunica, Warren and Washington counties.  Prior to Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi lawrequired
 that gaming vessels be located on the Mississippi River or on navigable waters in eligible counties along the Mississippi River, or in the waters of the State ofMississippi
 lying south of the state in eligible counties along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  Subsequent to Hurricane Katrina, changes to the law became effective whichallowed gaming facili
ties to be constructed on land in the three Gulf Coast counties, provided that no portion of the gaming facilities is located more than 800 feet from themean
 high water line of the Mississippi Sound or designated bays on the Sound.  The 800-foot limit does not apply to non-gaming facilities.  The law permits unlimitedstakes
 gaming on permanently moored dockside vessels or in land-based facilities on a 24-hour basis and does not restrict the percentage of space which may be utilizedfor gaming.  There are no l
imitations on the number of gaming licenses which may be issued in Mississippi. 
The
 casino licensees are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  Gaming licenses require the periodic payment offees and taxes and are not transferable. 
 Gaming licenses are issued for a maximum term of three years and must be renewed periodically thereafter.  The current license ofBeau Rivage Resorts, LLC is effectiv
e through April 20, 2019 and the current license of MGM Resorts Mississippi, Inc. is effective through June 22, 2018. 
We
 are registered by the Mississippi Gaming Commission under the Mississippi Act as a publicly traded holding company of the casino licensees.  As a registeredpublicly traded
 corporation, we are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and are required to periodically submit detailedfinancial,
 operating  and  other  reports  to  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  and  furnish  any  other  information  which  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  mayrequire.
  If  we  are  unable  to  satisfy  the  registration  requirements  of  the  Mississippi  Act,  we  and  our  casino  licensees  cannot  own  or  operate  gaming  facilities  inMississippi.
  The casino licensees are also required to periodically submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission and theMississippi Department of Revenu
e and to furnish any other information required thereby.  With certain exceptions, no person may become a stockholder of or receive anypercentage of profits 
from the casino licensees without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Mississippi Gaming Commission.

 Certain
 of our officers, directors and employees must be found suitable or be licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  We believe that we have appliedfor all
 necessary findings of suitability with respect to these persons, although the Mississippi Gaming Commission, in its discretion, may require additional persons to fileapplications
 for findings of suitability.  In addition, any person having a material relationship or involvement with us may be required to be found suitable, in which casethose
 persons must pay the costs and fees associated with the investigation.  A finding of suitability requires submission of detailed personal and financial informationfollowed
 by a thorough investigation.  There can be no assurance that a person who is subject to a finding of suitability will be found suitable by the Mississippi GamingCommission.
  The Mississippi Gaming Commission may deny an application for a finding of suitability for any cause that it deems reasonable.  Findings of suitabilitymust be periodically r
enewed. 
Changes
 in certain licensed positions must be reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  In addition to its authority to deny an application for a finding ofsuitability,
 the Mississippi Gaming Commission has jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a licensed position.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power torequire
 us to suspend or dismiss officers, directors and other key employees or sever relationships with other persons who refuse to file appropriate applications or whomthe authorities find un
suitable to act in their capacities. 
Employees associated with gaming must obtain
 work permits that are subject to immediate suspension.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission will refuse to issue awork
 permit to a person convicted of a felony and it may refuse to issue a work permit to a gaming employee if the employee has committed various misdemeanors orknowingly violated the Mississippi Ac
t or for any other reasonable cause. 
At
 any time, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to investigate and require a finding of suitability of any of our record or beneficial stockholders,regardless
 of  the  percentage  of  ownership.   Mississippi  law  requires  any  person  who  acquires  more  than  5%  of  our  voting  securities  to  report  the  acquisition  to  theMississippi Gaming Commission, and tha
t person may be required to be found suitable.  Also, any person who becomes a beneficial owner of more than 10% of our votingsecurities,
 as reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission, must apply for a finding of suitability by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  An applicant for finding ofsuitability must pay the 
costs and fees that the Mississippi Gaming Commission incurs in conducting the investigation. 
The
 Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  has  generally  exercised  its  discretion  to  require  a  finding  of  suitability  of  any  beneficial  owner  of  more  than  5%  of  aregistered
 public  or  private  company’s  voting  securities.   However,  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  has  adopted  a  regulation  that  permits  certain  institutionalinvestors
 to  own  beneficially  up  to  15%  and,  under  certain  circumstances,  up  to  19%,  of  a  registered  or  licensed  company’s  voting  securities  without  a  finding  ofsuitability.
  Under the regulations, an “institutional investor,” as defined therein, may apply to the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission for a waiverof
 a finding of suitability if such institutional investor (i) beneficially owns up to 15% (or, in certain circumstances, up to 19%) of the voting securities of a registered orlicensed
 company, and (ii) holds the voting securities for investment purposes only.  An institutional investor shall not be deemed to hold voting securities for investmentpurposes
 unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directlyor
 indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors of the registered or licensed company, any change in the registered or licensed company’scorporate
 charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered public or private company or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which theMississippi Gaming Commission finds to b
e inconsistent with holding the registered or licensed company’s voting securities for investment purposes only. 
Activities that are no
t deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include: 
 
• voting,  directly or indirectly through the delivery of a proxy furnished by the board of directors, on all matters voted upon by the holders of such votingsecurities;
 
 
• serving as a member of any committee of creditors or security holders formed in connection with a debt restructuring; 
 
• nominating any candidate for election or appointment to the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring; 
 
• accepting appointment  or election (or having a representative accept appointment or election) as a member of the board of directors in connection with a debtrestructuring and serving 
in that capacity until the conclusion of the member’s term; 
 
• making financial  and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change inmanagement, policies o
r operations; and 
 
• such other activities as the Mississippi Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent. 
 
8

 If
 a stockholder who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information including a list ofbeneficial
 owners.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission may at any time dissolve, suspend, condition, limit or restrict a finding of suitability to own a registered publiccompany’s equity interes
ts for any cause it deems reasonable. 
We may be required to disclose to the Mississippi Gaming 
Commission upon request the identities of the holders of any of our debt or other securities.  In addition,under the Mississippi Act, the Mississip
pi Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require holders of our debt securities to file applications, investigate the holders, andrequire the holders to be 
found suitable to own the debt securities. 
Although
 the Mississippi Gaming Commission generally does not require the individual holders of obligations such as notes to be investigated and found suitable,the
 Mississippi  Gaming Commission  retains  the discretion  to do so for any reason,  including but not limited  to a default,  or where the holder  of the debt instrumentexercises
 a material influence over the gaming operations of the entity in question.  Any holder of debt securities required to apply for a finding of suitability must pay allinvestigative fees and 
costs of the Mississippi Gaming Commission in connection with the investigation. 
Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a
 finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Mississippi Gaming Commissionmay
 be  found  unsuitable.   Any  person  found  unsuitable  and  who  holds,  directly  or  indirectly,  any  beneficial  ownership  of  our  securities  beyond  the  time  that  theMississippi
 Gaming Commission prescribes, may be guilty of a misdemeanor.  After receiving notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder, a holder of our debtsecurities or to have any o
ther relationship with us, we will be subject to disciplinary action if we: 
 
• pay the unsuitable person any div idend, interest or other distribution whatsoever; 
 
• recognize the exerc ise, directly or indirectly, of any voting rights conferred through such securities held by the unsuitable person; 
 
• pay the unsuitable person any r emuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise, except in limited and specific circumstances; 
 
• make any payment to the unsui table person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction; or 
 
• fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to divest himself or herself of the securities, includi ng, if necessary, the immediate purchase ofthe securities for cash at a
 fair market value. 
The
 casino licensees must maintain in Mississippi a current ledger with respect to the ownership of their equity securities and we must maintain in Mississippi acurrent
 list of our stockholders which must reflect the record ownership of each outstanding share of any equity security issued by us.  The ledger and stockholder listsmust
 be available for inspection by the Mississippi Gaming Commission at any time.  If any of our securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the recordholder
 may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  A failure to make that disclosure may be grounds forfinding the record hol
der unsuitable.  We must also render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner. 
The
 Mississippi Act requires  that the certificates  representing  securities  of a registered  publicly traded corporation  bear a legend  to the general  effect  that thesecurities
 are subject to the Mississippi Act and the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  On May 28, 2009, the Mississippi Gaming Commission grantedus a
 waiver of this legend requirement.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to impose additional restrictions on us and the holders of our securities at anytime.
 
Substantially
 all loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by the casino licensees must be reported to or approved by the MississippiGaming Commission.
  The licensed subsidiaries may not make a public offering of their securities, but may pledge or mortgage casino facilities with the prior approval ofthe
 Mississippi Gaming Commission.  We may not make a public offering of our securities without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission if any partof
 the proceeds  of the offering  is to be used to finance  the construction,  acquisition  or operation  of gaming  facilities  in Mississippi  or to retire  or extend  obligationsincurred
 for those purposes.  The approval, if given, does not constitute a recommendation or approval of the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the investmentmerits of the
 securities subject to the offering.  Effective June 23, 2015, the Mississippi Gaming Commission granted us a waiver of the prior approval requirement for oursecurities
 offerings for a period of three years, subject to certain conditions.  The waiver may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the issuance of aninterlocutory stop order by 
the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. 
 
9

 Under
 the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, the casino licensees may not guarantee a security issued by us pursuant to a public offering, orpledge
 their assets to secure payment or performance of the obligations evidenced by such a security issued by us, without the prior approval of the Mississippi GamingCommission.
  Similarly, we may not pledge the stock or other ownership interests of the casino licensees, nor may the pledgee of such ownership interests foreclose onsuch a
 pledge, without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  Moreover, restrictions on the transfer of an equity security issued by us and agreementsnot
 to  encumber  such  securities  granted  by  us  are  ineffective  without  the  prior  approval  of  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.   The  waiver  of  the  prior  approvalrequirement for our securities offerings
 received from the Mississippi Gaming Commission effective June 23, 2015 includes a waiver of the prior approval requirement forsuch guarantees, pledges and r
estrictions of the casino licensees, subject to certain conditions. 
We
 cannot change our control through merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of takeover without theprior
 approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, and otherpersons
 having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relatingto the transaction.
 
The
 Mississippi Legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and other corporate defensivetactics
 that affect corporate gaming licensees in Mississippi and corporations whose stock is publicly traded that are affiliated with those licensees may be injurious tostable
 and productive corporate gaming.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of thesebusiness practices
 upon Mississippi’s gaming industry and to further Mississippi’s policy to assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates,preserve the benefic
ial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form, and promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs. 
We
 may be required to obtain approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission before we may make exceptional repurchases of voting securities in excess ofthe
 current  market  price  of  its  common  stock  (commonly  called  “greenmail”)  or  before  we  may  consummate  a  corporate  acquisition  opposed  by  management.   Theregulations also require prior approval by the
 Mississippi Gaming Commission if we adopt a plan of recapitalization proposed by our Board of Directors opposing a tenderoffer made direct
ly to the stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of us. 
Neither
 we nor the casino licensees may engage in gaming activities in Mississippi while we, the casino licensees and/or persons found suitable to be associatedwith
 the  gaming  license  of  the  casino  licensees  conduct  gaming  operations  outside  of  Mississippi  without  approval  of  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.   TheMississippi
 Gaming Commission may require that it have access to information concerning our, and our affiliates’, out-of-state gaming operations.  We believe that wehave
 applied for all necessary waivers of foreign gaming approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission for the conduct of our active or planned gaming operationsoutside of Mississippi.
 
If
 the Mississippi Gaming Commission decides that the casino licensees violated a gaming law or regulation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission could limit,condition,
 suspend or revoke the license of the subsidiary.  In addition, we, the casino licensees and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for eachseparate violation.  A viol
ation under any of our other operating subsidiaries’ gaming licenses may be deemed a violation of the casino licensees’ gaming license. 
Because
 of a violation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission could attempt to appoint a supervisor to operate the casino facilities.  Limitation, conditioning orsuspension
 of the casino licensees’ gaming license or our registration as a publicly traded holding company, or the appointment of a supervisor could, and the revocationof any gaming license or r
egistration would, materially adversely affect our Mississippi gaming operations. 
The
 casino licensees must pay license fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming involved, to the State of Mississippi and to thecounty
 or city in which the licensed gaming subsidiary conducts operations.  Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable eithermonthly,
 quarterly or annually and are based upon a percentage of gross gaming revenues, the number of slot machines operated by the casino, and the number of tablegames operated by the cas
ino. 
The
 license fee payable to the State of Mississippi is based upon “gross revenues,” generally defined as cash receipts less cash payouts to customers as winnings,and
 generally equals 8% of gross revenue.  These license fees are allowed as a credit against our Mississippi income tax liability for the year paid.  The gross revenue feeimposed
 by  the  Mississippi  cities  and  counties  in  which  casino  operations  are  located  is  in  addition  to  the  fees  payable  to  the  State  of  Mississippi  and  equalsapproximately 4% of gross r
evenue. 
The
 Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted a regulation in 1994 requiring as a condition of licensure or license renewal that a gaming establishment’s planinclude a 500-car parkin
g facility in close proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure facilities 
10

 which
 will amount to at least 25% of the casino cost.  Infrastructure facilities are defined in the regulation to include a hotel with at least 250 rooms, theme park, golfcourse
 and  other  similar  facilities.   Beau  Rivage  and  Gold  Strike  Tunica  are  in  compliance  with  this  requirement.   On  January  21,  1999,  the  Mississippi  GamingCommission adopted an amendment to this regulation which increase
d the infrastructure requirement to 100% from the existing 25%; however, the regulation grandfathersexisting
 licensees and applies only to new casino projects and casinos that are not operating at the time of acquisition or purchase, and would therefore not apply to BeauRivage and
 Gold Strike Tunica.  In any event, Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica would comply with such requirement.  On February 21, 2013, the Mississippi GamingCommission adopted
 further amendments to this regulation to impose additional requirements on new casino projects.  However, the amended regulation grandfathers anylicensee
 who has been licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission prior to December 31, 2013; therefore, the amendments do not apply to Beau Rivage or GoldStrike Tunica.
 
Both
 the  local  jurisdiction  and  the  Alcoholic  Beverage  Control  Division  of  the  Mississippi  Department  of  Revenue  license,  control  and  regulate  the  sale  ofalcoholic
 beverages by the casino licensees.  Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica are in areas designated as special resort areas, which allows casinos located therein toserve
 alcoholic beverages on a 24-hour basis.  The Alcoholic Beverage Control Division requires that our key officers and managers and the casino licensees’ key officersand
 managers and all owners of more than 5% of the casino licensees’ equity submit detailed personal, and in some instances, financial information to the AlcoholicBeverage
 Control Division and be investigated and licensed.  All such licenses are non-transferable.  The Alcohol Beverage Control Division has the full power to limit,condition,
 suspend or revoke any license for the service of alcoholic beverages or to place a licensee on probation with or without conditions.  Any disciplinary actioncould, and revocation would, have a 
material adverse effect upon the casino’s operations.
Illinois
Government
Regulation
 
Our
 50% joint venture ownership interest in Grand Victoria Riverboat Casino, located in Elgin, Illinois (“Grand Victoria”) is subject to extensive state regulationunder the Illinois Riverboa
t Gambling Act (the “Illinois Act”) and the regulations of the Illinois Gaming Board (the “Illinois Board”). 
In
 February 1990, the State of Illinois legalized riverboat gambling.  The Illinois Act authorizes the Illinois Board to issue up to ten riverboat gaming owners’licenses on
 any water within the State of Illinois or any water other than Lake Michigan which constitutes a boundary of the State of Illinois.  The Illinois Act restricts thelocation of certain of the ten owners’ licenses.  Three of
 the licenses must be located on the Mississippi River.  One license must be at a location on the Illinois River southof
 Marshall County and another license must be located on the Des Plaines River in Will County.  The remaining licenses are not restricted as to location.  Currently, allten owner’s licenses are 
in operation in Alton, Aurora, East Peoria, East St.  Louis, Elgin, Metropolis, Rock Island, Des Plaines, and two licenses in Joliet. 
The
 Illinois Act strictly regulates the facilities, persons, associations and practices related to gaming operations.  It grants the Illinois Board specific powers andduties,
 and all other powers necessary and proper to fully and effectively execute the Illinois Act for the purpose of administering, regulating and enforcing the system ofriverboat
 gaming.  The Illinois Board has authority over every person, association, corporation, partnership and trust involved in riverboat gaming operations in the Stateof Illinois.
 
The
 Illinois Act requires the owner of a riverboat gaming operation to hold an owner’s license issued by the Illinois Board.  Each owner’s license permits theholder
 to own up to two riverboats as part of its gaming operation; however, gaming participants are limited to 1,200 for any owner’s license.  The number of gamingparticipants will be de
termined by the number of gaming positions available at any given time.  Gaming positions are counted as follows: 
 
• positions for electroni c gaming devices will be determined as 90% of the total number of devices available for play; 
 
• craps tables will be count ed as having ten gaming positions; and 
 
• games utilizing live g aming devices, except for craps, will be counted as having five gaming positions. 
Each
 owner’s license initially runs for a period of three years.  Thereafter, the license must be renewed annually.  The Board may renew an owner’s license for upto four years.  An owner licensee is eligible for renewal upo
n payment of the applicable fee and a determination by the Illinois Board that the licensee continues to meet allof
 the requirements of the Illinois Act and Illinois Board’s rules.  The owner’s license for Grand Victoria was issued in October 1994 and was renewed for a four-yearperiod
 that ends in October 2020.  An ownership interest in an owner’s license may not be transferred or pledged as collateral without the prior approval of the IllinoisBoard.
 
 
11

 Pursuant
 to the Illinois  Act, the Illinois Board established  certain  rules to follow in deciding whether to approve direct or indirect  ownership or control of anowner’s
 license.  The Illinois Board must consider the impact of any economic concentration caused by the ownership or control.  No direct or indirect ownership orcontrol
 may be approved which will result in undue economic concentration of the ownership of a riverboat gambling operation in Illinois.  The Illinois Act specifies anumber
 of criteria for the Illinois Board to consider in determining whether the approval of the issuance, transfer or holding of a license will create undue economicconcentration.  The appli
cation of such criteria could reduce the number of potential purchasers for the Grand Victoria or our 50% joint venture interest therein. 
The
 Illinois  Act  does  not  limit  the  maximum  bet  or  per  patron  loss.   Minimum  and  maximum  wagers  on  games  are  set  by  the  holder  of  the  owner’slicense. 
 Wagering may not be conducted with money or other negotiable currency.  No person under the age of 21 is permitted to wager and wagers only may be receivedfrom a person present on the 
riverboat.  With respect to electronic gaming devices, the payout percentage may not be less than 80% or more than 100%. 
Illinois
 imposes a number of taxes on Illinois casinos.  Such taxes are subject to change by the Illinois legislature and have been increased in the past.  The Illinoislegislature
 also  may  impose  new  taxes  on  Grand  Victoria’s  activities.   Illinois  currently  imposes  an  admission  tax  of  $2.00  per  person  for  an  owner  licensee  thatadmitted 1,000,000 persons or fewer 
in the 2004 calendar year, and $3.00 per person for all other owner licensees (including Grand Victoria). 
Additionally, Illinois
 imposes a wagering tax on the adjusted gross receipts, as defined in the Illinois Act, of a riverboat operation.  The owner licensee is required,on a daily basis, to wire the wage
ring tax payment to the Illinois Board.  Currently, the wagering tax is: 
 
• 15.0% of adjusted gross receip ts up to and including $25.0 million; 
 
• 22.5% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $25.0 million but not exceeding $50.0 million; 
 
• 27.5% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $50.0 million but not exceeding $75.0 million; 
 
• 32.5% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $75.0 million but not exceeding $100.0 million; 
 
• 37.5% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $100.0 million but not exceeding $150.0 million; 
 
• 45.0% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $150.0 million but not exceeding $200.0 million; and 
 
• 50.0% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $200.0 million. 
A
 holder of any gaming license in Illinois is subject to imposition of fines, suspension or revocation of such license, or other action for any act or failure to act bythe licensee or
 the licensee’s agents or employees, that is injurious to the public health, safety, morals, good order and general welfare of the people of the State of Illinois,or
 that would discredit or tend to discredit the Illinois gaming industry or the State of Illinois.  The Illinois Board may revoke or suspend licenses, as the Illinois Boardmay
 determine and, in compliance with applicable Illinois law regarding administrative procedures, may suspend an owner’s license, without notice or hearing, upon adetermination that
 the safety or health of patrons or employees is jeopardized by continuing a riverboat’s operation.  The suspension may remain in effect until the IllinoisBoard
 determines that the cause for suspension has been abated and it may revoke the owner’s license upon a determination that the owner has not made satisfactoryprogress toward abating the ha
zard. 
If
 the Illinois Board has suspended, revoked or refused to renew an owner’s license or if a riverboat gambling operation is closing and the owner is voluntarilysurrendering its owner’s li
cense, the Illinois Board may petition the local circuit court in which the riverboat is situated for appointment of a receiver.  The circuit court hassole jurisdiction over any 
and all issues pertaining to the appointment of a receiver.  The Illinois Board specifies the specific powers, duties and limitations of the receiver. 
The
 Illinois Board requires that each “Key Person” of an owner licensee submit a Personal Disclosure or Business Entity Form and be investigated and approvedby
 the Illinois Board.  The Illinois Board determines which positions, individuals or Business Entities are required to be approved by the Board as Key Persons.  Onceapproved, such Key Person status must be m
aintained.  Key Persons include: 
 
• any  Business Entity and any individual with an ownership interest or voting rights of more than 5% in the licensee or applicant and the trustee of any trustholding such ownership interest or vo
ting rights; 
 
12

  
• the directors of the licensee  or applicant and its chief executive officer, president and chief operating officer or their functional equivalents; 
 
• a  Gaming  Operations  Manager  or  any  other  business  entity  or  individual  who has  influence  and/or  control  over  the  conduct  of  gaming  or  the  RiverboatGaming Operation; and
 
 
• all other individuals or Busin ess Entities that, upon review of the applicant’s or licensees Table of Organization, Ownership and Control the Board determineshold
 a position or a level of ownership, control or influence that is material to the regulatory concerns and obligations of the Illinois Board for the specifiedlicensee or applicant.
 
Each
 owner licensee must provide a means for the economic disassociation of a Key Person in the event such economic disassociation is required by an order ofthe
 Illinois Board.  Based upon findings from an investigation into the character, reputation, experience, associations, business probity and financial integrity of a KeyPerson, the Illinois Board may en
ter an order upon the licensee or require the economic disassociation of the Key Person. 
Applicants
 for and holders of an owner’s license are required to obtain the Illinois Board’s approval for changes in the following:  (i) Key Persons; (ii) type ofentity;
 (iii) equity and debt capitalization of the entity; (iv) investors and/or debt holders; (v) source of funds; (vi) applicant’s economic development plan; (vii) riverboatcapacity or significant design change;
 (viii) gaming positions; (ix) anticipated economic impact; or (x) agreements, oral or written, relating to the acquisition or dispositionof
 property (real or personal) of a value greater than $1 million.  Illinois regulations provide that a holder of an owner’s license may make distributions to its stockholdersonly to the extent that such d
istributions do not impair the financial viability of the owner. 
The
 Illinois Board requires each holder of an owner’s license to obtain the Illinois Board’s approval prior to issuing a guaranty of any indebtedness.  Accordingly,we
 and our  subsidiaries  with  a  direct  interest  in  Grand  Victoria intend  to  petition  the  Illinois  Board  to  allow those  subsidiaries to  issue subsidiary guaranties of  anyindebtedness
 that we incur in the future to the extent such guaranties  are required  by our lenders.  Although we and those  subsidiaries believe  the Illinois Board willcontinue
 to  approve  our  petitions  and  allow such  guaranties  of  our  future  indebtedness,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  Illinois  Board  will  continue  to  grant  thenecessary approvals.
 
The
 Illinois  Board  requires  that  each  “institutional  investor,”  as  that  term  is  defined  by  Illinois  Board,  that,  individually  or  jointly  with  others,  cumulativelyacquires, directly
 or indirectly, 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly-traded licensee or a licensee’s publicly-traded parent corporation shall, within noless
 than ten  days after  acquiring  such securities,  notify  the Illinois  Board of  such ownership and shall,  upon  request,  provide  such additional  information  as may berequired
 by the Illinois Board.  An institutional investor that, individually or jointly with others, cumulatively acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of any class ofvoting
 securities of a publicly-traded licensee or a licensee’s publicly-traded parent corporation shall file an “Institutional Investor Disclosure Form,” provided by theIllinois
 Board, within 45 days after cumulatively acquiring such level of ownership interest, unless such requirement is waived by the Illinois Board.  Additionally, wemust notify the Illinois Boa
rd as soon as possible after we become aware that we are involved in an ownership acquisition by an institutional investor. 
The
 Illinois Board may waive any licensing requirement or procedure provided by rule if it determines that the waiver is in the best interests of the public and thegaming industry.  Also, the Illino
is Board may, from time to time, amend or change its rules. 
On
 January  1,  2008,  Illinois’  statewide  public  smoking  ban  became  effective.   Smoking  is  now  illegal  in  Illinois’  casinos,  bars,  restaurants  and  other  publicestablishments.  This may con
tinue to negatively impact the gaming industry in Illinois. 
From
 time  to  time,  various  proposals  have  been  introduced  in  the  Illinois  legislature  that,  if  enacted,  would  affect  the  taxation,  regulation,  operation  or  otheraspects
 of the gaming industry.  The Illinois legislature regularly considers proposals that would expand gaming opportunities in Illinois.  Some of this legislation, ifenacted, could adversely 
affect the gaming industry.  No assurance can be given whether such or similar legislation will be enacted. 
The
 Illinois legislature continues to discuss the possibility of gaming expansion.  This expansion could include several new casinos (including one in Chicago),increased
 gaming positions in existing casinos, as well as gaming positions at Illinois racetracks.  If gaming expansion occurs, Grand Victoria’s operating results could beadversely impacted by the
 increased competition.

 On
 July  13,  2009,  Illinois  enacted  the  Video  Gaming  Act,  which  legalizes  the  use  of  up  to  five  video  gaming  terminals  in  most  bars,  restaurants,  fraternalorganizations
 and veterans’ organizations holding valid Illinois liquor licenses, as well as at qualifying truck stops.  The Illinois Board adopted a set of Regulations andcontinues
 to release new or emergency Regulations, as necessary, to implement and regulate the Video Gaming Act.  Effective October 9, 2012, video gaming in Illinoisbecame operational. 
 The video gaming terminals in licensed establishments allow patrons to play games such as video poker, line up and blackjack.   In December 201 6 ,over 
5,700  licensed establishments were operating nearly 2 5 ,000 video  gaming terminals.  Grand Victoria’s revenues may be adversely impacted by the availability ofvideo gaming terminals 
in non-casino establishments proximately located to its customer base.

  MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession is exclusively governed by Macau law.  MGM Grand Paradise is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts ofMacau in case of any potent
ial dispute or conflict relating to our subconcession. 
MGM
 Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract expires on March 31, 2020.  Unless the subconcession is extended, on that date, all casino operations and relatedequipment

• operate and conduct casino g ames of chance in a fair and honest manner without the influence of criminal activities; and 
 
• safeguard and ensure Macau ’s interests in tax revenue from the operation of casinos and other gaming areas. 
The subconcession contract r
equires MGM Grand Paradise Limited to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance which are in place. 
MGM Grand Paradise Limited is also sub

Under
 the subconcession, MGM Grand Paradise Limited is obligated to pay to the Macau S.A.R.  an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variable portionbased on
 the number and type of gaming tables employed and gaming machines operated.  The fixed portion of the premium is equal to 30 million patacas (approximately$3.75 million, based
 on exchange rates at December 30, 2016).  The variable portion is equal to 300,000 patacas per gaming table reserved exclusively for certain kinds ofgames
 or  players,  150,000  patacas  per  gaming  table  not  so  reserved  and  1,000  patacas  per  electrical  or  mechanical  gaming  machine,  including  slot  machines(approximately
 $37,578,  $$18,789  and  $125,  respectively,  based  on  exchange  rates  at  December  30,  2016),  subject  to  a  minimum  of  forty  five  million  patacas(approximately $5.6 million, based

 Currently,
 the gaming tax in Macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue.  However, gross gaming revenue does not include deductions for creditlosses.
  As a result, if MGM Grand Paradise issues markers to its customers in Macau and is unable to collect on the related receivables from them, it has to pay taxes onits winnings from these custom
ers even though it was unable to collect the related receivables. 
MGM
 Grand  Paradise  has  received  a  concession  from  the  Macau  government  to  use  a  10.67  acre  parcel  of  land  for  MGM  Macau  (the  “MGM  Macau  LandContract”).  The land concess

Maryland
Government
Regulation
 
The
 Maryland State Lottery Video Lottery Terminal Law (“Maryland VLT Law”) subjects the owners and operators of video lottery facilities to extensive statelicensing and regulatory requirements.  We are subject to the Maryland VLT La
w and the regulations promulgated to implement it through our ownership interest in MGMNational Harbor, LLC, which owns and operates th
e MGM National Harbor video lottery facility in Prince George’s County, Maryland. 
Under
 the Maryland VLT Law, the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission (“Maryland Commission”), in conjunction with the Maryland Lottery andGaming Control Agency
 (“Maryland Agency”), maintains authority to regulate the operation of video lottery terminals and tables games within the State of Maryland, andto
 issue video lottery operation licenses to qualified applicants.  The Maryland Video Lottery Facility Location Commission (“Maryland Location Commission”) has theauthority
 to award up to six video lottery operation licenses within the State of Maryland and is responsible for evaluating competing proposals and awarding the videolottery
 operation licenses to applicants based on business and market, economic development and location siting factors.  The Maryland Location Commission cannotaward
 a video lottery operation license to an applicant until the Maryland Commission determines that the applicant is qualified.  On October 10, 2013, the MarylandCommission
 determined that MGM National Harbor, LLC and all applicable principals were qualified, and on December 23, 2013, the Maryland Location Commissionawarded
 the video lottery operation license in Prince George’s County, Maryland to MGM National Harbor, LLC.  MGM National Harbor, LLC was awarded the sixthand final video lottery operation license
 in Maryland.  On December 7, 2016, the Maryland Commission issued a video lottery operation license to MGM National Harbor,LLC, which license has an initia
l term of 15 years. 
The initial
 license fee was based on the number of video lottery terminals initially proposed within the video lottery facility.  As 3,600 video lottery terminals wereproposed for
 MGM National Harbor, our initial license fee was $21 million, and the Maryland Location Commission determined that MGM National Harbor may have upto
 3,600 terminals.  Within 1 year of the end of the initial 15–year license term, a video lottery operation licensee may reapply for a license that has a license term of 10years and a license fe
e to be established by statute. 
At
 the request of the Company, the Maryland Commission has temporarily reduced the number of permitted video lottery terminals to 3,321, which temporaryreduction will become pe
rmanent if there are not 3,600 terminals in operation at MGM National Harbor by December 8, 2017. 
Under
 the Maryland VLT Law, video lottery terminals each must have an average payout percentage of at least 87%.  Video lottery facilities are permitted tooperate 24 hours a day, and patrons 
must be 21 years of age to wager.  While alcohol may be offered 
16

 in
 the video lottery facility, it may not be offered free of charge.  The Maryland VLT Law and regulations also impose various restrictions on check cashing, debit andcredit card usage, ATMs, and othe
r transactions within the video lottery facility. 
The Maryland
 Commission has extensive authority to conduct background investigations and to determine whether applicants for a video lottery operation license,affiliated
 holding or intermediary companies, directors, officers, key management employees, principals, partners, and other persons or entities holding a five percent orgreater interest 
in the applicant, are qualified under the Maryland VLT Law. 
The Maryland VLT Law provides that inst
itutional investors may be exempt from certain regulatory requirements, and an Institutional Investor Waiver Applicationmay
 be submitted for entities holding an interest in an applicant or licensee that are considered institutional investors.  The term “institutional investor” generally includesinsurance
 companies, banks and financial institutions, investment companies, trusts and advisors, pension funds, etc.  The Maryland Commission’s decision concerningwhether to grant a waiver is discretionary, and based o
n a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the institutional investor’s securities, whether the investor issubstantially involved in th
e video lottery operations of the licensee, and the investor’s gaming licensure history in other jurisdictions. 
After
 a video lottery operation license is awarded and/or issued, the Maryland Commission has responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of thelicensee
 and its officers, directors, and other designated persons.  The Maryland Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or restrict a video lottery operationlicense,
 and may levy civil penalties for regulatory and other violations.  The licensee’s participation in video lottery and table game operations is expressly deemed arevocable
 privilege under the Maryland VLT Law, conditioned on the proper and continued qualification of the licensee and the licensee meeting reporting requirementsand
 continuing  to provide  any assistance  and information  necessary  to  the Maryland  regulators.   Each licensee  has an  affirmative  responsibility  to provide  an annualupdate
 of  applicable  licensing  information  to  the  Maryland  Commission.   Among  other  things,  the  Maryland  Commission  is  also  responsible  for  the  collection  ofapplication,
 license and other fees, conducting investigations into the operation of video lottery terminals and table games, and reviewing and ruling on complaints, andmay conduct unannounced inspect
ions of the video lottery facility premises or the licensee’s records and equipment. 
The
 regulations promulgated to implement the Maryland VLT Law impose detailed substantive and procedural requirements related to video lottery licensing andongoing
 operations.   The  regulations  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  provisions  concerning:   licensing  investigations  and  hearings;  marketing  controls  and  standards;internal
 control standards related to accounting, finance and statistics, audits, record retention, complimentaries, surveillance, security, cage and customer transactions,promotions,
 and  other  gaming  related  controls;  facility  design  standards;  table  games  surveillance;  gaming  floor  plans;  the  transportation  and  testing  of  video  lotteryterminals
 and table games equipment; the registration of video lottery terminals and table games; voluntary and mandatory patron exclusion; responsible gaming; andjunket
 enterprises and representatives.  Applicants and licensees must also meet requirements concerning minority business participation, provide health insurance andretirement benefits for employees
, and give preference to hiring employees located within ten miles of the video lottery facility. 
Generally,
 a  video  lottery  operation  license  may  not  be  transferred,  assigned  or  pledged  as  collateral  without  approval  from  the  MarylandCommission.
  Specifically, a licensee cannot sell or transfer more than 5% of the legal or beneficial interests in the licensee unless the Maryland Commission is notifiedand
 determines that the buyer or transferee meets all applicable qualification and regulatory requirements.  If the licensee fails to meet these requirements, the applicablelicense
 will be automatically revoked ninety days after the transfer or sale.  Entities and individuals are also prohibited from owning an interest in more than one videolottery
 facility, and any application to the Maryland Location Commission to apply for an additional license must include a plan for divesting the applicable interest in theinitial
 license.  Applicants seeking investors in an entity applying for a video lottery operation license must make serious, good-faith efforts to solicit and interview areasonable
 number of minority investors before a license will be awarded by the Maryland Location Commission, and following the award, must again make serious,good-faith efforts to inter
view minority investors in any future attempts to raise venture capital or attract new investors to the entity awarded the license. 
The
 Maryland Commission retains the authority to recommend or propose changes to the Maryland VLT Law, and may amend or change regulations concerningthe Maryland VLT Law, which, if enact
ed, could adversely affect the gaming industry and our ability to operate in Maryland.
New
Jersey
Government
Regulation
 
Our
 ownership of Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey subjects us to extensive state regulation under the New Jersey Casino Control Act and the regulationspromulgated
 thereunder (collectively, the “NJ Act”) and various other statutes and regulations.  The New Jersey Casino Control Commission (“NJ Commission”) and theNew Jersey
 Division of Gaming Enforcement (“NJ Division” and, together with the NJ Commission, the “NJ Gaming Authorities”) are, to varying degrees, empowered toregulate a wide spectrum
 
17

 of
 gaming  and  non-gaming  related  activities  and  to  approve  the  form  of  ownership  and  financial  structure  of  not  only  a  casino  licensee,  but  also  its  holding  andintermediary companies and e
ntity qualifiers. 
The
 NJ Commission issues casino licenses and casino key employee licenses and the NJ Division issues all other types of licenses, including permits to conductintrastate
 Internet gaming and registrations and licenses to persons who provide goods or services to a casino.  The NJ Division also is responsible for investigating alllicense applications 
and for monitoring compliance with and enforcing the requirements of the NJ Act. 
On
 June 24, 2010, the NJ Commission renewed Borgata’s casino license effective July 1, 2010 for a term which became indefinite by operation of law.  However,no
 later than five years after the issuance of a casino license, and approximately every five years thereafter, the casino licensee and its qualifying entities and individualsmust
 submit information to the NJ Gaming Authorities to demonstrate their continuing qualification.  In addition, the NJ Commission may reopen the license hearing atany
 time, and the NJ Commission must do so at the request of the NJ Division.  In September 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries were found qualified as holdingcompanies of Borgata.
 
Pursuant
 to the NJ Act and applicable precedent, no entity may hold a casino license unless each officer, director, person who directly or indirectly holds anybeneficial
 interest or ownership of the securities of the licensee, each person who in the opinion of the Director of the NJ Division has the ability to control or elect amajority
 of the board of directors of the licensee (other than a banking or other licensed lending institution acting in the ordinary course of business) and each of itsholding, intermediary or subs
idiary companies, obtains and maintains qualification approval from the NJ Gaming Authorities. 
Persons
 holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a holding or intermediary company are presumed to have the ability to control the company or elect one ormore
 of its directors and will, unless this presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence or the qualification requirement is waived, be required to individuallyqualify.
  Equity  securities  are  defined  in  the  NJ  Act  as  any  voting  stock  or  any  other  security  having  a  direct  or  indirect  participation  in  the  profits  of  theissuer.
  Notwithstanding either the presumption of control for holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a holding company or the requirement that a casino licenseeestablish
 and maintain the qualification  of certain holders of debt securities,  the NJ Act provides for a waiver of qualification  for passive “institutional  investors,” asdefined by the NJ Act under cert
ain circumstances. 
Casino
 licensees are also required to establish and maintain the qualifications of any financial backer, investor, mortgagee, bondholder, or holder of indentures,notes
 or other evidences of indebtedness, either in effect or proposed which bears any relation to the casino operation or casino hotel premises who holds 25% or more ofsuch
 financial  instruments  or  other  evidences  of  indebtedness;  provided,  however,  in  circumstances  of  default,  persons  holding  10%  of  such  financial  instruments  orevidences
 of indebtedness shall be required to establish and maintain their qualifications.  Persons who hold less than these thresholds may be required to establish andmaintain
 their qualifications in the discretion of the Director of the NJ Division.  Banks and licensed lending institutions, however, are exempt from any qualificationrequirements if they 
are acting in the ordinary course of business. 
The NJ Act imposes certain restrictions upon the issuance, o
wnership and transfer of securities of a casino licensee and its holding and intermediary companies anddefines
 the term “security” to include instruments which evidence a direct or indirect beneficial ownership or creditor interest, including stock (common and preferred)mortgages,
 debentures, security agreements, notes, warrants, options and rights.  If the NJ Commission finds that a holder of such securities is not qualified under the NJAct,
 it has the right to take any remedial action deemed appropriate including the right to force divestiture by such disqualified holder of such securities.  In the event thatcertain
 disqualified holders fail to divest themselves of such securities, the NJ Commission has the power to revoke or suspend the casino license or licenses related to thecompany
 which  issued  the  securities.   It  is  unlawful  for  a  disqualified  holder  (i)  to  exercise,  directly  or  through  any  trustee  or  nominee,  any  right  conferred  by  suchsecurities
 or (ii) to receive any dividends or interest upon such securities or any remuneration, in any form, from its affiliated casino licensee for services rendered orotherwise.
 
The
 NJ Act requires our certificate of incorporation to provide that our securities are held subject to the condition that if a holder is found to be disqualified by theNJ Commission pursuant to the NJ Act, such holder shall dispose of his interest
 in the company.  Accordingly, our certificate of incorporation provides that a holder of oursecurities must dispose of such securities if the holder is fou
nd disqualified under the NJ Act.  In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that we may redeem thestock of any holder found to be disqua
lified. 
The
 ability of a lender to foreclose on pledged assets, including gaming equipment, is subject to compliance with the NJ Act.  Generally, no person is permitted tohold
 an ownership interest in or manage a casino or own any gaming assets, including gaming devices, without being licensed.  Consequently, any lender who desires toenforce
 a security interest must file the necessary applications for licensure, be investigated, and either be found qualified by the NJ Commission or obtain interim casinoauthorization (“ICA”) pr
ior to obtaining any ownership interest.  Similarly, any prospective purchaser of an ownership interest in a casino or of 
18

 gaming
 assets must file the necessary applications for licensure, be investigated, and either found qualified by the NJ Commission or obtain ICA prior to obtaining anyownership interest or gaming 
assets.
Massachusetts
Government
Regulation
 
The
 Massachusetts  Expanded Gaming Act (“Massachusetts  Act”)  subjects the owners and operators  of gaming establishments  to extensive  state licensing  andregulatory
 requirements.   We  are  subject  to  the  Massachusetts  Act  and  the  regulations  promulgated  to  implement  it  through  our  ownership  interest  in  Blue  TarpreDevelopment,
 LLC (“Blue Tarp”), which is expected to operate a gaming establishment in Springfield, Massachusetts, which establishment is currently scheduled forcompletion and opening in the 
third quarter of 2018.   
Under
 the Massachusetts Act, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (“Massachusetts Commission”) is responsible for issuing licenses under the MassachusettsAct
 and assuring that licenses are not issued or held by unqualified, disqualified or unsuitable persons.  The Investigations and Enforcement Bureau (“IEB”), which is aBureau
 within  the  Massachusetts  Commission,  is  responsible  for  conducting  administrative  investigations  of  applicants  and  licensees,  and  for  generally  enforcing  theMassachusetts
 Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  In order to enforce the law, the IEB coordinates with the Massachusetts State Police, Attorney Generaland
 the  Alcoholic  Beverage  Control  Commission  in  order  to  perform  its  duties.   The  Massachusetts  Act  also  establishes  a  Gaming  Enforcement  Division  within  theMassachusetts
 Attorney General’s Office responsible for investigating and prosecuting criminal violations of the Massachusetts Act.  The Massachusetts Commission hasthe
 authority to award up to three Category 1 licenses (table games and slot machines), and one Category 2 license (slot machines only), within the Commonwealth ofMassachusetts to qualifi
ed applicants.   
On
 December  23, 2013, the Massachusetts  Commission determined  that  Blue Tarp and all  applicable  principal  individuals  and entities  were qualified,  and onNovember 6, 2014, the Massachusetts Comm
ission awarded the sole Category 1 license in Region B of Massachusetts to Blue Tarp, effective November 7, 2014.   
While
 a Category 1 license has been awarded to Blue Tarp, Blue Tarp may not conduct gaming activities until an operations certificate has been issued by theMassachusetts Commission, 
which will be issued upon compliance with applicable provisions of the Massachusetts Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, receipt ofall
 required permits and approvals, compliance with the conditions of Blue Tarp’s Category 1 license, and Blue Tarp continuing to meet applicable licensing, registration,qualification
 and other regulatory requirements.  Under the Massachusetts Act, a Category 1 gaming licensee who fails to commence operations within one year from theopening
 date approved by the Massachusetts Commission is subject to the suspension or revocation of its license and, if the Commission determines that the gaminglicensee acted in bad 
faith in its application, be assessed a fine of $50,000,000 or less.   
The
 initial license term is 15 years, which will commence upon the Massachusetts Commission’s approval of the commencement of the operation of the gamingestablishment.
  The initial license fee for Category 1 licenses is $85,000,000, as determined by the Massachusetts Commission and authorized by the Massachusetts Act,which
 amount Blue Tarp has paid.  All Category 1 and Category 2 gaming licensees are also subject to additional annual fees under the Massachusetts Act.  Category 1licensees must generally make on-going annual capital
 expenditures to their gaming establishments in a minimum aggregate amount equal to 3.5 percent of the net gamingrevenues derived from th
e establishment. 
Under
 the Massachusetts Act, gaming establishments may be open 24 hours a day, patrons must be 21 years of age to wager.  Gaming beverage licenses may begranted
 by the Massachusetts Commission for the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages at the gaming establishment except between the hours of 2 a.m.  and 8a.m..
  The Massachusetts Act and regulations also describe procedures for, and restrictions on, check cashing, debit and credit card usage, ATMs, and other transactionswithin
 the gaming establishment.  Certain regulations related to these transactions and other casino internal controls are currently in draft form, and subject to furtherreview, revision and final 
approval.   
The
 Massachusetts  Commission,  in  particular  the  IEB,  has  extensive  authority  to  conduct  background  investigations  and  to  determine  whether  applicants  forCategory
 1 and Category 2 licenses, affiliated holding or intermediary companies, subsidiaries, directors, managers, officers, financiers and debt holders, associates, keygaming
 executives  and  employees,  other  gaming  related  employees,  and  other  persons  or  entities  holding  a  five  percent  or  greater  direct  or  indirect  interest  in  theapplicant, are quali
fied under the Massachusetts Act (with certain exemptions for institutional investors in the discretion of the Massachusetts Commission).   
After
 a Category 1 license is awarded, the Massachusetts Commission and IEB have responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of the licensee andits
 officers, directors, employees and other designated persons.  The Massachusetts Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or condition a Category 1 license,or
 any  other  license  issued  under  the  Massachusetts  Act,  and  the  IEB  may  levy  civil  penalties  for  regulatory  and  other  violations.   All  licenses  issued  under  theMassachusetts Act are expr
essly 
19

 deemed
 a revocable privilege, conditioned on the licensee’s fulfillment of all conditions of licensure, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the licensee’scontinuing
 qualification and suitability .   Among other things, the Massachusetts Commission is also responsible for the collection of application, license and other fees,conducting
 investigations of and monitoring applicants and licensees, and reviewing and ruling on complaints, and may conduct inspections of the gaming establishmentpremises or the licens
ee’s records and equipment .   
The
 regulations  promulgated  to  implement  the  Massachusetts  Act  impose  detailed  substantive  and  procedural  requirements  related  to  licensing  and  on-goingoperations.
  The regulations include, but are not limited to, provisions concerning: licensing and registration of employees; accounting procedures and internal controls;surveillance
 and  security  requirements;  gaming  equipment,  devices  and  systems,  and  device  registration  and  testing;  self-exclusion;  on-going  reporting  requirementsrelated
 to construction, approvals and operations; temporary licensure; marketing and affirmative marketing plans; notification requirements related to new or changes inshareholders,
 executives,  and  other  qualifiers;  notification  and/or  approval  of  certain  material  events  and  transactions;  complimentary  services;  on-going  capitalexpenditures;
 political  contributions;  credit  issuance  and  customer  transactions;  auditing  and  record  retention;  facility  design  and  gaming  floor  plans;  slot  machinepossession and transportation; 
table game rules and procedures; employee credentials; vendors and junkets; and count room and cage procedures. 
Generally,
 interests  in  a  gaming  establishment  and  Category  1  licenses  may  not  be  transferred  without  notification  to  and  approval  of  the  MassachusettsCommission.
  The sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition of any security issued by a corporation which holds a gaming license is conditional and will beineffective
 if disapproved by the Massachusetts Commission.  Category 1 licensees may also not change their business governing structure without the notification andapproval of the Massachuset
ts Commission, and may not operate, invest in or own, in whole or in part, another gaming licensee’s license or gaming establishment. 
The
 Massachusetts  Commission  retains  the  authority  to  promulgate,  amend  or  repeal  regulations  concerning  the  Massachusetts  Act,  which,  if  enacted,  couldadversely
 affect the gaming industry and our ability to operate in Massachusetts.  Further, certain regulations are currently in draft form, and subject to further review,revision and final approva
l.

I
NDEPENDENT
AUDITORS’
REPORT 
To the Board of Directors
CityCenter Holdings, LLC
 
We
 have audited  the accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of CityCenter Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries  (the “Company”),  which comprise  theconsolidated
 balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, members’ equity, and cash flows for each of thethree years in the per
iod ended December 31, 2016, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
Management’s
Responsibility
for
the
Consolidated
Financial
Stat
ements 
Management
 is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generallyaccepted
 in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation ofconsolidated financial statement
s that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Auditors’
Responsibility
 
Our
 responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditingstandards generally
 accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether theconsolidated financial statement
s are free from material misstatement. 
An
 audit  involves  performing  procedures  to obtain  audit  evidence  about the amounts  and  disclosures  in the consolidated  financial  statements.  The proceduresselected
 depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud orerror.
 In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financialstatements
 in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  theCompany’s
 internal  control.  Accordingly,  we  express  no  such  opinion.  An  audit  also  includes  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  thereasonableness of sig
nificant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. 
We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
Opinion
 
In
 our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CityCenter Holdings, LLCand its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their
 cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2016, in accordance with accoun
ting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

BASIS
OF

PRESENTATION
AND
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 
Basis

of
presentation.
The  consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company does not have a variableinterest
 in any variable interest entities. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations are not necessarilyindicative of the resu
lts to be expected in the future. 
Reclassification.
Certain  assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses have been reclassified related to discontinued operations. See Note 3 for additional informationrelated to discontinued op
erations. 
Management’s

use
of
estimates.
The  consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited
 States  of  America.  Those  principles  require  the  Company’s  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  andliabilities
 and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  as  of  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  thereporting period. Actual r
esults could differ from those estimates. 
Fair

value
measurements.
Fair  value  measurements  affect  the  Company’s  accounting  for  and  impairment  assessments  of  its  long-lived  assets  and  intangibleassets.
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at themeasurement
 date and is measured according to a hierarchy consisting of: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observableinputs for similar asse
ts; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs.5


 
Cash

and
cash
equivalents.
Cash  and cash equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date ofacquisition. Such investments 
are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. 
Accounts

receivable 
and 
credit 
risk.
The  Company  issues  markers  to  approved  casino  customers  following  investigations  of  creditworthiness.  As  ofDecember
 31,  2016,  approximately  64%  of  the  Company’s  casino  receivables  were  due  from  customers  from  foreign  countries.  Enforceability  issues,  business  oreconomic conditions or othe
r significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables. 
Trade
 receivables,  including  casino  and  hotel  receivables,  are  typically  non-interest  bearing  and  are  initially  recorded  at  cost.  Accounts  are  written  off  whenmanagement
 deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An allowance for doubtful accounts ismaintained
 to reduce  the Company’s receivables  to their  estimated  realizable  amount,  which approximates  fair  value.  The allowance  is estimated  based on a specificreview of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and busi
ness conditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2016,no significant concentratio
ns of credit risk existed. 
Inventories.
Inventories  consist primarily of food and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost isdetermined primar
ily by the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined using the cost method. 
Residential
real
estate.
As of  December 31, 2016, all residential units were sold. In prior periods, residential real estate represented capitalized costs of residentialinventory,
 which  consisted  of  completed  condominium  units  available  for  sale  less  impairments  previously  recognized.  Costs  included  land,  direct  and  indirectconstruction and developmen
t costs, and capitalized property taxes and interest. 
Property

and
equipment.
Property  and equipment are stated at cost including capitalized interest. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment areincluded
 in  the  determination  of  income  or  loss.  Maintenance  and  repairs  that  neither  materially  add  to  the  value  of  the  property  nor  appreciably  prolong  its  life  arecharged to expense as incur
red. Property and equipment are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis: 
Buildings and improvements
   20 to 40 years   Land improvements
   10 to 20 years   Furniture and fixtures
   3 to 20 years   Equipment
   3 to 15 years    
Project
 costs are stated at cost and recorded as property and equipment (which includes adjustments made upon the initial contribution by MGM Resorts to theextent
 such property or equipment is contributed by MGM Resorts) unless determined to be impaired, in which case the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value.Final
 costs  of  CityCenter  development  were  determined  in  connection  with  settlement  of  Perini  litigation  in  December  2014  as  discussed  in  Note  11.  The  Companyrecorded non-operating exp
ense related to the Perini settlement of $8 million for statutory interest on estimated amounts payable in 2014. 
In
 December  2015,  the  Company  decided  to  close  the  Zarkana  show  at  the  Aria  Resort  &  Casino  as  part  of  a  plan  to  expand  its  conference  and  conventionspace.
 As a result, the Company shortened the useful lives of the assets related to the Zarkana theatre and recognized accelerated depreciation expense of $82 million and$20 million
 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fully depreciated assets related to the Zarkana theatre were disposed in April 2016 andconstruction of the confe
rence and expansion space began in May 2016. 
Capitalized

interest.
  The  interest  costs  associated  with  development  and  construction  projects  are  capitalized  and  included  in  the  cost  of  the  project.Capitalization of int
erest ceases when the project is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period. 
Impairment

of
long-lived
assets.
The  Company evaluates its property and equipment for impairment as held and used. The Company reviews assets to be heldand
 used for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. It then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carryingamount
 of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carryingamount, then impairmen
t is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. 
Intangible

assets.
Indefinite-lived  intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. TheCompany performs its annual i
mpairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. See Note 6 for further discussion.6


 
Debt
issuance
costs
.  The Company capitalizes debt issuance costs, which include legal and other direct costs related to the issuance of debt. The capitalized costsare amortized straight-line to intere
st expense over the contractual term of the debt. 
Revenue

recognition
and
promotional
allowances.
Casino  revenue is the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognizedfor funds deposited by customers before
 gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and for chips in the customers’ possession (“casino outstanding chip liability”). Hotel,food
 and beverage, entertainment, retail and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed and goods are provided. Advance deposits on rooms andadvance ticket sales are recorde
d as accrued liabilities until services are provided to the customer. 
Gaming
 revenues  are  recognized  net  of  certain  sales  incentives,  including  discounts  and  points  earned  in  point-loyalty  programs.  The  retail  value  ofaccommodations, food
 and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances. Theestimated cost of provid
ing such promotional allowances is primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Real

estate
sales.
Revenue  for  residential  sales  is  deferred  until  closing  occurs,  which  is  when  title,  possession  and  other  attributes  of  ownership  have  beentransferred
 to the buyer and the Company is not obligated to perform activities after the sale. Additionally, the buyer’s initial and continuing investment must be adequateto demonstrate a comm
itment to pay and the buyer’s receivable cannot be subject to future subordination. 
Residential
 operating expenses include cost of real estate sold, holding costs, selling costs, indirect selling costs and valuation allowances for residential mortgagenotes
 receivable. Costs associated with residential sales were deferred during construction, except for indirect selling costs and general and administrative expense, whichwere expensed as incurred.
 
Loyalty
programs.
Aria participates  in the MGM Resorts’ “M life Rewards” loyalty program. Customers may earn points and/or Express Comps for their gamingplay
 which can be redeemed at restaurants, box offices or the M life Rewards front desk at participating properties. Points may also be redeemed for free slot play onparticipating
 machines. The Company records a liability based on the points earned multiplied by the redemption value, less an estimate for points not expected to beredeemed,
 and  records  a  corresponding  reduction  in  casino  revenue.  Customers  also  earn  Express  Comps  based  on  their  gaming  play  which  can  be  redeemed  forcomplimentary
 goods and services, including hotel rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment. The Company records a liability for the estimated costs of providinggoods
 and services for Express Comps based on the Express Comps earned multiplied by a cost margin, less an estimate for Express Comps not expected to be redeemedand records a corresponding exp
ense in the casino department. 
Advertising.
The  Company  expenses  advertising  costs  the  first  time  the  advertising  takes  place.  Advertising  expense  is  included  in  preopening  and  start-upexpenses
 when related to the preopening and start-up period and in general and administrative expense when related to ongoing operations. Advertising expense was $15million, $20 million and $20 m
illion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Property

transactions,
net.
The  Company classifies transactions related to long-lived assets – such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, and gainsand losses on the sale of fixed 
assets – within “Property transactions, net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 9 for details. 
Income
taxes.
The Company  is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Therefore, federal income taxes are the responsibility of the Members. Asa result, no provisi
on for income taxes is reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Comprehensive
income
(loss).
Net income (loss) equals co mprehensive income (loss) for all periods presented. 
Dividends

and
distributions.
In  March 2016, a $90 million dividend was declared in accordance with the Company’s annual distribution policy, and in April2016, the Company declared a $990 mi
llion special distribution in connection with the Crystals sale.7


Of
 these dividends and distributions totaling $1.1 billion, $540 million was paid to MGM Resorts in May 2016 and $540 million was paid to Infinity World in July 2016.In
 April 2015, the Company declared and paid a special dividend of $400 million. Under the annual distribution policy, the Company intends to distribute up to 35% ofexcess cash flow, subject to th
e approval of the Company’s board of directors. 
Recently

issued
accounting
standards.
In  2015  and  2016,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  the  following  Accounting  StandardUpdates
 (“ASU”) related to revenue recognition, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and December 15, 2018, for public entities and nonpublicentities, respectiv
ely, pursuant to ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date”: 
 
• ASU  2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting forrevenue
 arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU2014-09
 provides  for  a  new  revenue  recognition  model  which  includes  a  five-step  analysis  in  determining  when  and  how  revenue  is  recognized,including
 identification  of  separate  performance  obligations  for  each  contract  with  a  customer.  Additionally,  the  new  model  will  require  revenuerecognition
 to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receivein exchange for those goods or serv
ices; 
• ASU  2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),”clarifies
 the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations as it relates to ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-08 provides guidance related tothe
 assessment an entity is required to perform to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is,the
 entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good or service to be provided by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent) when another party isinvolved in providing goods or servic
es to a customer; 
• ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,” clarifies guidance related toidentifying
 performance  obligations  and  licensing  implementation  guidance  as  it  relates  to  ASU  2014-09.  ASU  2016-10  includes  targetedimprovements
 based on input the FASB received from the Transition  Resource Group for Revenue Recognition and other stakeholders.  It seeks toproactively
 address areas in which diversity in practice potentially could arise, as well as to reduce the cost and complexity of applying certain aspectsof the guidance both at imp
lementation and on an ongoing basis; and 
• ASU 2016-12, “Revenue from  Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,” addresses narrow-scopeimprovements to the guidance on collectability, noncash consideratio
n and completed contracts at transition as it relates to ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-12also provides for
 a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxesand other similar taxes collecte
d from customers. 
The
 Company  is  currently  assessing  the  impact  that  the  adoption  of  the  above  ASUs  related  to  revenue  recognition  will  have  on  its  consolidated  financialstatements
 and footnote disclosures. The Company plans to adopt the above ASUs for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017. However, the Company hasidentified a
 few significant impacts. Under the new guidance the Company expects it will no longer be permitted to recognize revenues for goods and services provided tocustomers
 for free as an inducement to gamble as gross revenue with a corresponding offset to promotional allowances to arrive at net revenues as discussed above. TheCompany
 expects the majority of such amounts will offset casino revenues. In addition, accounting for Express Comps granted under MGM Resort’s M life Rewardsprogram
 as outlined above will also change. Under the new guidance Express Comps earned by customers through past revenue transactions will be identified as separateperformance
 obligations and will be recorded as a reduction in gaming revenues when earned at the retail value of such benefits owed to the customer (less estimatedbreakage).
 When customers redeem such benefits and the performance obligation is fulfilled by the Company, revenue will be recognized in the department that providesthe
 goods or services (i.e. hotel, food and beverage, entertainment).   In addition, given that M life Rewards is an aspirational program with multiple customer tiers whichprovide
 certain  benefits  to  tier  members,  the  Company  will  need  to  further  assess  if  such  benefits  are  deemed  to  be  separate  performance  obligations  under  the  newguidance.
 
In
 February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” (“ASU 2016-02”), which replaces the existing guidance inAccounting
 Standards Codification (“ASC”) 840, “Leases.” ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15,
 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both financeleases
 and  operating  leases  will  result  in  the  lessee  recognizing  a  right-of-use  (“ROU”)  asset  and  a  corresponding  lease  liability.  For  finance  leases  the  lessee  wouldrecognize
 interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The Company iscurrently assessing the i
mpact that adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.8


 
In
 August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts andCash
 Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force),” (“ASU 2016-15”), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2016-15 amendsthe
 guidance of ASC 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The primary purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce thediversity
 in  practice  that  has  resulted  from  the  lack  of  consistent  principles,  specifically  clarifying  the  guidance  on  eight  cash  flow  issues.  The  Company  is  currentlyassessing the impact tha
t adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
Subsequent

events.
Management  has evaluated subsequent events through February 17, 2017, the date these consolidated financial statements were issued. InJanuary
 2017, the Company repriced its $1.2 billion term loan B senior credit facility and re-priced and extended its $75 million revolving credit facility. See Note 8 fordetails.

In
 April 2016, the Company closed the sale of Crystals, a retail, dining and entertainment district, to a venture led by Invesco Real Estate and Simon PropertyGroup
 for  approximately  $1.1  billion.  The  Company  recognized  a  gain  of  $400  million  on  the  sale  of  Crystals,  which  is  included  within  “Income  from  discontinuedoperations,”
 for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2016.  The  results  of  Crystals  are  classified  as  discontinued  operations  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  ofoperations
 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 as the sale of Crystals was a strategic shift in business. The cash flows of discontinued operations areincluded
 with the cash flows of continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The 2015 and 2014 consolidated statements of cashflows have not been adjusted to r

The
 majority  of  the  Company’s  intangible  assets  are  assets  that  were  contributed  by  MGM  Resorts  upon  formation  of  the  Company.  Intellectual  propertyrepresents
 trademarks, domain names, and other intellectual property including the CityCenter,
Aria 
and
Vdara

 domain.  There is no contractualor market-based lim
it to the use of these intangible assets and therefore they have been classified as indefinite-lived. 
The
 Company performs an annual review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter each year. The asset’s fair value is comparedto
 its carrying value, and an impairment charge is recorded for any short-fall. Fair value is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method which discounts cash flows thatwould be
 required to obtain the use of the related intangible asset. Key inputs in the relief-from-royalty analysis include forecasted revenues related to the intangible asset,market royalty rat
es, discount rates and terminal year growth rates. 
The
 aircraft  time  sharing  agreement  intangible  asset  relates  to  an  agreement  between  MGM  Resorts  and  the  Company  whereby  MGM  Resorts  provides  theCompany the use of MGM Resorts’ aircr
aft in its operations. The Company is charged a rate that is based10


on
 Federal  Aviation  Administration  regulations,  which  provides  for  reimbursement  for  specific  costs  incurred  by  MGM  Resorts  without  any  profit  or  mark-up.Accordingly,
 the  fair  value  of  this  agreement  was  recognized  as  an  intangible  asset,  and  is  being  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  20  years,  and  will  be  fullyamortized in 2029.

Senior

secured
credit
facility.
At  December  31,  2016, the  Company’s senior  secured  credit  facility  consisted  of  a $75  million  revolving  facility  maturing  inOctober
 2018, and a $1.2 billion term loan B facility maturing in October 2020. The term loan B facility requires the Company to make amortization payments of 0.25%of
 the original principal balance at each quarter end. The Company used cash on hand to permanently repay $266 million of the term loan B facility during 2016. In June2014
 the Company completed a repricing of the term loan B facility and used available cash to permanently repay $150 million of the term loan B facility, a portion ofwhich represents the amor
tization obligation through the remaining term of the facility. 
The
 loans under the term loan B bear interest, in the case of Eurodollar loans, at LIBOR plus 3.25% with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, and in the case of base rateloans, at
 the base rate plus 2.25%. As of December 31, 2016, the interest rate on the term loan B was 4.25%. Loans under the revolving facility bear interest, in the case ofEurodollar
 loans, at LIBOR plus 3.75% or 4.00%, depending on the Company’s credit ratings, and in the case of base rate loans, 2.75% or 3.00%, depending on theCompany’s ratings. Additionally, th
e Company pays an applicable fee of 0.375% or 0.50%, depending on the Company’s credit ratings, for the unused11


portion of the revolving fa
cility. The Company had $63 million of available borrowing capacity under its senior secured credit facility at December 31, 2016. 
The
 senior secured credit facility is a general senior obligation of the Company and ranks equally with the Company’s other existing and future senior obligations,is
 fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed  on  a  senior  secured  basis  by  the  restricted  subsidiaries  of  the  Company,  and  is  secured  by  a  first-priority  perfected  lien  onsubstantially all of th
e Company’s assets and the assets of its subsidiaries. 
The
 senior secured credit facility contains customary positive, negative and financial covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintains a quarterlyminimum
 interest coverage ratio of 2.0:1.0 and a maximum quarterly leverage ratio for the trailing four quarters of: 6.00:1.00 for March 31, 2016 through December 31,2016; and 5.50:1.00 for March 31, 2017 and ther
eafter.  The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2016. 
Pursuant
 to the senior secured credit facility, the Company is required to make permanent repayments of principal based on an annual calculation of excess cashflow, as defined
 in the agreements. The percentage of excess cash flow required to be repaid is based on the Company’s leverage ratio as of the end of the fiscal year, with50%
 required to be repaid if the leverage ratio is greater than 5.0:1.0 as of the measurement date, 25% if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0:1.0 and greater than4.0:1.0,
 and no payment of excess cash flow is required if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.0:1.0. During 2016 and as of December 31, 2016, the Company didnot
 have excess cash flow required to be paid in accordance with the senior secured credit agreement for 2016. During 2015 the Company paid $38 million related to its2015 excess cash flow obligation and 
recorded $5 million in current portion of long-term debt related to its remaining obligation. 
In January 2017, the Company re-pri
ced its $1.2 billion term loan B senior credit facility at par and re-priced and extended its $75 million revolving facility. Theterm loan B facility wi
ll now bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%.  The revolving facility was re-priced at LIBOR plus 2.00% and extendedto July 2020.

long-term
debt.
The  estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $1.26 billion and$1.50 billion, respectively, 
and was determined using estimates based on trading prices of similar liabilities, a Level 2 input.

SEGMENT
INFORMATION
 
The
 Company determines  its segments based on the nature  of the products  and services  provided.  As of December  31, 2016, the Company has the followingreportable
 segments: Aria, Vdara, Mandarin Oriental, and Residential. The Company has aggregated residential operations from Mandarin Oriental and Veer into onereportable
 segment “Residential” given the similar economic characteristics and business of selling and leasing high-rise condominiums. All other operating segments arereported
 separately.  The  Company’s  operating  segments  do  not  include  the  ongoing  activity  associated  with  closing  out  its  construction  costs  and  certain  corporateadministrative costs. Dur
ing 2016 the Company sold Crystals which was previously a reportable segment. 
The
 Company analyzes the results of its operating segments’ operations based on Adjusted EBITDA, which it defines as earnings before interest and other non-operating
 income  (expense),  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization,  preopening  and  start-up  expenses,  NV  Energy  exit  expense,  and  property  transactions,  net.  TheCompany believes Adjusted EBITDA is 1) a widely used 
measure of operating performance in the hospitality and gaming industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation ofhospitality and gaming comp
anies. 
While
 items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluating the Company’s or its segments’ earningsperformance,
 it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly dependingon
 specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, the Company believes excluded items may not relatespecifically
 to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, write-downs and impairments includes normal recurring disposals and gains andlosses on sales of assets rel
ated to specific assets within CityCenter, but also includes impairment charges which may not be comparable period over period.

Energy.
In  July 2016, MGM Resorts, including the Company filed its notice to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy and will purchase energy,capacity,
 and/or ancillary services from a provider other than NV Energy. In September 2016, the Company paid an upfront impact payment of $14 million, of which $2million
 was billed to third party entities and represented a reduction in the overall impact fee expense. Of this $2 million receivable for amounts billed to third partyentities,
 $1 million is included in Accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2016. Additionally, the Company is required to make ongoing payments to NV Energy fornon-bypassable rate
 charges which primarily relate to its share of NV Energy’s portfolio of renewable energy contracts which extend through 2040 and each entity’s shareof the
 costs of decommissioning and remediation of coal-fired power plants in Nevada. As of December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an estimate of such liability on adiscounted basis of $2 million 
in “Due to MGM Resorts International” and $13 million in “Other long-term obligations.” 
Construction

litigation.
In  March 2010, Perini, general contractor for CityCenter, filed a lawsuit in the Eighth Judicial District Court for Clark County, State ofNevada,
 against MGM MIRAGE Design Group (a wholly owned subsidiary of MGM Resorts which was the original party to the Perini construction agreement) andcertain
 direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company. Perini asserted, among other things, that CityCenter was substantially completed, but the defendants failed to payPerini approximately $490 m
illion allegedly due and owing under the construction agreement for labor, equipment and materials expended on CityCenter. 
In April
 2010, Perini served an amended complaint in this case which joined as defendants many owners of CityCenter residential condominium units (the “CondoOwner
 Defendants”),  added a count for foreclosure of Perini's recorded  master mechanic’s lien against the CityCenter property in the amount of approximately  $491million,
 and asserted the priority of this mechanic’s lien over the interests of the Company, the Condo Owner Defendants and the Company’s lenders in the CityCenterproperty.
  In November 2012, Perini filed a second amended complaint which, among other things, added claims against the CityCenter defendants of breach of contract(alleging
 that CityCenter’s Owner Controlled Insurance Program (“OCIP”) failed to provide adequate project insurance for Perini with broad coverages and high limits),and
 tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (alleging improper administration by the Company of the OCIP and Builders Risk insuranceprograms).
 Prior to the Final Settlement, as defined below, the Company settled the claims of 219 first-tier Perini subcontractors (including the claims of any lower-tiersubcontractors
 that might have claims through those first-tier subcontractors). As a result of these settlement agreements and the prior settlement agreements betweenPerini
 and the Company, most but not all of the components of Perini’s non-Harmon-related lien claim against the Company were resolved. On February 24, 2014, Perinifiled a revised lien 
for $174 million as the amount claimed by Perini and the remaining Harmon-related subcontractors. 
During
 2013, the Company reached a settlement agreement with certain professional service providers against whom it had asserted claims in this litigation forerrors
 or omissions with respect to the CityCenter project, and relevant insurers.  This settlement was approved by the court and the Company received proceeds of $38million in 2014 related 
to both the Harmon and other components of the CityCenter project. 
In 2014, the Company reached a set
tlement with builder’s risk insurers of a claim relating to damage alleged at the Harmon and received proceeds of $55 million. 
In
 December  2014,  the  Perini  matter  was   concluded  through  a  global  settlement  among  the  Company,  MGM  Resorts,  Perini,  the  remaining  subcontractors,including
 those implicated in the Harmon work (and their affiliates), and relevant insurers, which followed the previously disclosed settlement agreements and an extra-judicial
 program for settlement of certain project subcontractor claims. This global settlement concluded all outstanding claims in the case (the “Final Settlement”). Theeffectiveness
 of the global settlement was made contingent upon the Company’s execution of certain indemnity and release agreements (which were executed in January2015)
 and the Company’s procurement of replacement general liability insurance covering construction of the CityCenter development (which was obtained in January2015).
 
The
 Final Settlement, together with previous settlement agreements relating to the non-Harmon related lien claims,  resolved all of Perini’s and the remainingsubcontractors’ lien claims against the
 Company and MGM Resorts, certain direct and indirect subsidiaries, MGM Resorts International Design (formerly known as MGMMIRAGE
 Design  Group),  and  the  Condo  Owner  Defendants.  However,  the  Company  expressly  reserved  any  claims  for  latent  or  hidden  defects  as  to  any  portion  ofCityCenter’s
 original construction (other than the Harmon) not known to the Company at the time of the agreement.  The Company and MGM Resorts entered into theFinal Settlement solely 
as a compromise and settlement and not in any way as an admission of liability or fault.   
15


The key terms of the Final Set
tlement included:   
With
 respect to its non-Harmon lien claims, Perini waived a specific portion of its lien claim against the Company, which combined with the prior non-Harmonagreement and accru
ed interest resulted in a total payment to Perini of $153 million, approximately $14 million of which was paid in December 2014. The total payment toPerini
 was funded by MGM Resorts under their completion guarantee and included the application of approximately $58 million of condominium proceeds that werepreviously held in escrow by the Company 
to fund construction lien claims upon final resolution of the Perini litigation. 
The
 Company’s recovery for its Harmon construction defect claims, when added to the Harmon-related proceeds from prior insurance settlements of $85 million,resulted
 in gross cash settlement proceeds to the Company of approximately $191 million (of which approximately $18 million was paid by MGM Resorts to CityCenterunder the completion guar
antee in February 2015). 
In
 conjunction with the Final Settlement, MGM Resorts and an insurer participating in the OCIP resolved their arbitration dispute concerning such insurers claimfor
 payments it made under the OCIP general liability coverage for contractor costs incurred in the Harmon litigation, premium adjustments and certain other costs andexpenses. MGM Resorts settled this dispu
te for $38 million, and funded the majority of such amounts under the completion guarantee in January 2015. 
Harmon.
As  discussed above, a global  settlement was reached in the Perini litigation in December 2014, which finally resolved all outstanding liens, claims andcounterclaims
 between the Company and MGM Resorts on one hand, and Perini, the remaining subcontractors and remaining insurers on the other hand. Among thematters
 resolved were the Company’s claims against Perini and other contractors and subcontractors with respect to construction at the Harmon. Pursuant to leave of courtin
 2014, the Company commenced demolition of the building. The Company has completed a partial demolition of the building and is currently evaluating options forfurther
 demolition and plans for the future use of the remaining structure. The Company believes the remaining demolition of the Harmon structure if demolished to theground level would cost approxima
tely $13 million. 
Other
litigation.
The  Company is a party to various legal proceedings that relate to construction and development matters and operational matters incidental to itsbusiness. Management
 does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. TheCompany
 maintained an OCIP during the construction and development process. Under the OCIP, certain insurance coverages may cover a portion of the Company’sgeneral liability, workers
 compensation, and other potential liabilities. 
Other
guarantees.
The Company is party to various guar antee contracts in the normal course of business, which are generally supported by letters of credit issuedby financial institut
ions. The Company’s available borrowing capacity under the senior secured credit facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit.  At December31, 2016, the Company had $12 million in le
tters of credit outstanding. 
Leases

the
Company

The Company is party to various le ases for real estate and equipment under operating lease arrangements. The Company’sfuture minimum obligations
 under non-cancelable leases are immaterial in each of the next five years, and in total. 
Leases

The  Company enters into operating leases related to retail, dining and entertainment venues. As of December 31, 2016,the
 Company has 11 such leases in place. Tenants are primarily responsible for tenant improvements, though the Company provides construction allowances to certainlessees. Leases include bas
e rent, common area maintenance charges and, in some cases, percentage rent based on the sales of the lessee. 
Expected fixed future m

Residential

leases.
In  October of 2010, the Company began a program to lease a portion of unsold residential condominium units at Veer and Mandarin Orientalwith
