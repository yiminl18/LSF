Item 1.
Business This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated here
in by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations, estimates, andprojections as of the date of th
is filing. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I —“Risk Factors.” As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiari
es, unless the context indicates otherwise.General
We seek to be Earth’s most 
customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention,commitment to opera
tional excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers,developers, enterprises, 
content creators, advertisers, and employees.We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way theCompany evaluates its business pe
rformance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements andSupplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment 
Information.”Consumers
We serve consumers through our on
line and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of millions ofunique products to be sold by us and by third p
arties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa,devices, streaming, and physi
cally visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, and Ring, and wedevelop and produce media con
tent. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use functionality, and timely customer service. Inaddition, we offer subscript
ion services such as Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes fast, free shipping on millions of items, access to award-winningmovies and series, and other b
enefits.We fulfill custome
r orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks that we operate; co-sourced andoutsourced arrangements 
in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which are supplementedby co-sourced arrangemen
ts. See Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.”Sellers
We offer programs tha
t enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record inthese transactions. We earn
 fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.Developers and Enterprises
We serve developers and en
terprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through AWS, which offers a broad set ofon-demand technology servic
es, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services.Content Creators
We serve authors and independ
ent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a royalty optionand make their books avail
able in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allow authors,musicians, filmmake
rs, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content.Advertisers
We provide advertising se
rvices to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.3

Table of ContentsCompetition
Our businesses encompass a large v
ariety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolvingrapidly and intensely comp
etitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potentialcompetitors include: 
(1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer andsell to consumers and businesses
; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) websearch engines, comparison shopp
ing websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods andservices, either directly or i
n collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting,omnichannel sales, invento
ry and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillmentand logistics services fo
r themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based
 infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, andelectronic devices
; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or otherformats. We believe that the 
principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment.Additional competitive 
factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability andwillingness to change business pra
ctices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brandrecognition, and greate
r control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursuerestrictive distr
ibution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictiveterms, and devote more r
esources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, whichenhances the ability of n
ew, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development ofnew business models and the entry of n
ew and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen theircompetitive positions.
Intellectual Property
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual propertyas critical to our suc
cess, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees,customers, partners, and oth
ers to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names,trademarks, service 
marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.Seasonality
Our business is affected by season
ality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.Human Capital
Our employees are crit
ical to our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,608,000full-time and part
-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualifiedpersonnel is intense, part
icularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition forpersonnel across other par
ts of our business.As we strive to be Earth’s best e
mployer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the besttalent. We rely on nume
rous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay andbenefits, flexible work a
rrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (funded education for hourly employees) and theAmazon Technical Academy (so
ftware development engineer training). We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployednumerous programs that advan
ce employee engagement, communication, and feedback.4

Risk Factors Please carefully consid
er the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The events andconsequences discussed in these 
risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverseeffect on our business, growth, repu
tation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, andstock price. These risk fa
ctors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently knownto us or that we currently do not 
consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting globaldisruptions on our business and operat
ions discussed in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”and in the risk factors be
low, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of therisks discussed below.
Business and Industry Risks
We Face Intense Competition
Our businesses are rapidly evolv
ing and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and indifferent industries, inclu
ding physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices,digital content, adver
tising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories,more customers, and/or gr
eater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may securebetter terms from v
endors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.Competition continues to int
ensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as ourcompetitors enter in
to business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. Inaddition, new and enhanced techno
logies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase ourcompetition. The Intern
et facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to competeagainst us. As a result of compe
tition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required toincrease our spending or lower p
rices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks
We may have limited o
r no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, whichcan present new and difficu
lt technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other qualityissues. In addition, profitab
ility, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoupour investments in them. Fai
lure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investmentsbeing written down or written off. 
In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize theexpected benefits of new t
echnologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation.Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks
Our international act
ivities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, wehave relatively li
ttle operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintaininternational opera
tions and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.In addition to risks describ
ed elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:•
local economic and political conditions;•
government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protectionmeasures, including export du
ties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;•
restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertaintyas a result of less Inter
net-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal6

Table of Contentsprecedent, and varying rul
es, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectualproperty rights;
•
business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;•
limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;•
limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;•
shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;•
laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictionson pricing or discounts;
•
lower levels of use of the Internet;•
lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;•
lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;•
difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•
different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;•
compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials andother third parties;
•
laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and•
geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.As international physical, 
e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption ofevolving business models. Local co
mpanies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, aswell as their more est
ablished local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and Ind
ia regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and licenserequirements that may restrict (i) f
oreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internetcontent, and (iii) the s
ale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements,we provide certain techno
logy services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the governmentrestricts the ownership or 
control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certainmarketing tools and logist
ics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities thatare third-party sel
lers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, andthe PRC and India may from time 
to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact thesestructures and activi
ties. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governmentswill ultimately tak
e a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates areunable to access suffic
ient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, orother laws or regulations or 
changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and otherfinancial penalti
es, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely.The Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations
Demand for our products and servi
ces can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, orunforeseeable events, such 
as in response to natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climatechange), or geopolitica
l events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restockpopular products in suffici
ent amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstockproducts, we may be required to 
take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. Weregularly experienc
e increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timelydelivery for the holiday s
eason. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience systeminterruptions that mak
e our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and theattractiveness of our p
roducts and services. In addition, we may be unable7

Table of Contentsto adequately staff our 
fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer serviceco-sourcers may be unable 
to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory aremagnified during periods of h
igh demand.We generally have paym
ent terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers. As aresult of holiday sales, as o
f December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as aresult of cash flows provided by or us
ed in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as ofDecember 31. Our accounts payabl
e balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cashequivalents, and marketable
 securities balances.We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Se
llersThe law relating to the l
iability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the futurerequire changes in the way th
is business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collectingpayments, fraudulently or o
therwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’descriptions, and to prevent s
ellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful orunethical manner, viol
ating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operatesufficiently, it can h
arm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A2ZGuarantee, we reimburse buye
rs for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase andcould negatively affe
ct our operating results.We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protec
ting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third PartiesWe regard our tradem
arks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to oursuccess, and we rely on tradem
ark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, andothers to protect our propr
ietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available.We also may not be able to 
acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain namesmay not protect our trad
emarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon,or diminish the value of our 
trademarks and other proprietary rights.We are not always able to d
iscover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken by third parties that license ourproprietary rights may 
materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure ofsignificant financi
al and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or preventthird parties from in
fringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquireequivalent or superior t
echnology or other intellectual property rights.We have been subject to, and 
expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual propertyrights of third parties. Such 
claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerialresources, injunctions aga
inst us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allegethat we have infringed the
ir rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third partieswhose sole or primary business is to 
assert such claims.Our digital content offe
rings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioning of thedigital rights manage
ment technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.We Have Foreign Exchange Risk
The results of operations of, 
and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed toforeign exchange rate 
fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses onthe remeasurement o
f intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also holdcash equivalents and/or m
arketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and8

Table of ContentsJapanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar streng
thens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materiallyless than expected and vic
e versa.Operating Risks
Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources
We are continuing to rap
idly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructureto support our retail and se
rvices businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations,systems, technical per
formance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to managegrowth effectively could d
amage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate
We are not always able to 
accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of ourexpenses and investments is f
ixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.Our revenue growth may not be sustain
able, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continuedgrowth of demand for the products 
and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. Asoftening of demand, whether c
aused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.Our sales and operating resul
ts will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:•
our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands;•
our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;•
our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;•
the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;•
changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;•
timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;•
the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;•
the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;•
the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impacton our operating results;
•
variations in the mix of products and services we sell;•
variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;•
the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;•
factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related tosustainability, custome
rs, employees, or other topics);•
the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories;•
increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, energy products, commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technologyinfrastructure products;
•
constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs;•
the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired andunconstrained access to our on
line services;•
our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;•
the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwisetailor our product and serv
ice offerings;9

the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computerintrusions, outages, and simil
ar events; and•
disruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopoliticalevents and security issues (
including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), labor or trade disputes, and similar events.We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optim
izing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data CentersFailures to adequately 
predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time resultin excess or insufficient
 fulfillment or data center capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm ourbusiness. As we continue to add fulfil
lment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networksbecome increasingly co
mplex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.In addition, failure to op
timize inventory or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We andour co-sourcers may be unabl
e to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment networkcurrently is being aff
ected by global supply chain constraints and constrained labor markets, which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy asufficient number of peop
le to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like. We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of ouremployees from time to time an
d, if successful, those organizational efforts may decrease our operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our fulfillmentnetwork operating effic
iency.Under some of our commerci
al agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operatingour fulfillment network. Our 
failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment servicesto accurately fore
cast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpectedcosts and other harm to our busin
ess and reputation.We rely on a limited nu
mber of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable termswith these companies or per
formance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems,including as a result of l
abor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability toreceive inbound inventory e
fficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused disasters (including publichealth crises) or ext
reme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events.We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches
Because we collect, process, s
tore, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information,failure to prevent or 
mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’ technology, products, andsystems, could: expose us or our custo
mers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability,or regulatory action (
including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers orsellers from using our stor
es, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety ofreasons, including, without lim
itation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and otherfunctions. Some of our systems have 
experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can beno assurance that future 
incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes thatare designed to protect 
customer data and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-partyvendor or customer, such measu
res cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented.We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy
We experience occas
ional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficientlyaccepting or fulfil
ling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services.Steps we take to add software and ha
rdware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not besufficient to avoid syste
m interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.10

Table of ContentsOur computer and communica
tions systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural orhuman-caused disasters (
including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (includingterrorist attacks 
and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these eventscould cause system inter
ruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which couldmake our product and servic
e offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not besufficient. In addition, ou
r insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and beexpensive to remedy.
The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain H
ighly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our BusinessWe depend on our senior manage
ment and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies. We alsorely on other highly skilled p
ersonnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has historically beenintense. For example, we exper
ience significant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technicalstaff. In addition, changes we 
make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as lessfavorable compared to o
ther companies’ policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executiveofficers or other key e
mployees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm ourbusiness.
Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks
We have significant suppl
iers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to oursourcing, services, manufa
cturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers toguarantee availabi
lity of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers tolimit or stop selling or 
licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplierbankruptcies due to poor econom
ic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises), or for other reasons, may result in ourbeing unable to procure al
ternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, violations by our suppliers orother vendors of applicabl
e laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practicesregarded as unethical, uns
afe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Allianc
es, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to RisksWe provide physical, e-c
ommerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances,and business relationships. Under th
ese agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enablesellers to offer produc
ts or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resourcecommitments, which may l
imit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercialrelationships, which may inc
lude web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and e
ngaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partiallydependent on the volume of the o
ther company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lowerthan expected or the agreeme
nt may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic allianceson favorable terms. We 
also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, ordeveloping these services.
As our agreements terminate
, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendmentson less favorable terms o
r encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.Our present and fut
ure commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as:•
disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•
impairment of other relationships;11

Table of Contents•
variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and•
difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments
We have acquired and inves
ted in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies.These transactions cre
ate risks such as:•
disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•
problems retaining key personnel;•
additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;•
the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;•
the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of anyintegration of operations;
•
the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;•
the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;•
the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and data security, human resource, and otheradministrative syste
ms to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented;•
losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s financial performance into our financialresults;
•
for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, or investments for which we arerequired to file financial statement
s or provide financial information, the dependence on the investee’s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems,controls, and processes;
•
the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;•
the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;•
potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and•
for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, andregulatory risks associate
d with specific countries.As a result of future acquis
itions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, oramortization expenses 
related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all.In addition, valuations support
ing our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have experiencedimpairments or other-than-temporar
y declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.We Face Significant Inventory Risk
In addition to risks describ
ed elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed tosignificant inventory r
isks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing,defective merchand
ise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and otherfactors. We endeavor to 
accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, however,can change significant
ly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product,it may be difficult 
to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certaintypes of inventory or components 
requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventorylevels of certain produ
cts, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant sellingseasons. Any one of the inventory risk f
actors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.12

Table of ContentsWe Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks
We accept payments using 
a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from acustomer’s bank account, consu
mer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, wecurrently are subject to, a
nd may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authenticationprocesses that could resul
t in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit anddebit cards, we pay interch
ange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to providecertain Amazon-branded p
ayment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotionalfinancing. In each case, 
it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit cardprograms, which could adversely 
affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operatingrules, including data secu
rity rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficultor impossible for us to comply. Fa
ilure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or preventfraudulent activity 
involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lossof our ability to accep
t credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and ourbusiness and operating results 
could be adversely affected.In addition, we provide regula
ted services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to thirdparties, and because we provid
e services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatoryinspection, bonding and capita
l maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, andauthentication. We a
re also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international moneytransfers, privacy, dat
a use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation ofapplicable laws or regul
ations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highl
y VolatileWe have a rapidly evolving bus
iness model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks describedelsewhere in this Item 1A, as we
ll as:•
changes in interest rates;•
conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in;•
quarterly variations in operating results;•
fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular;•
changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;•
changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;•
changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;•
changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and•
transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.Volatility in our stock pri
ce could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grantlarger stock awards than we hav
e historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.Legal and Regulatory Risks
Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business
We are subject to gene
ral business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, andomnichannel retail, digital co
ntent, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and services that weoffer or sell. These regu
lations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, pricing, content,copyrights, distributi
on, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation,electronic contra
cts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services,registration, licensing, a

red Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, thecharacteristics, legality, and 
quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, healthcare, and other matters. Itis not clear how existing laws gove
rning issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumerprotection apply to aspec
ts of our operations such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial intelligencetechnologies and services. A l
arge number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as thescope of our businesses expand. We a
re regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existinglaws, regulations, or interp
retations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based onclaims that aspects o
f our operations violate competition rules, including aspects of Amazon’s European marketplace for sellers, particularly with respect to use of data,fulfillment servi
ces, and featured offers. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws andregulations, or inquiries, 
investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civiland criminal liabi
lity or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost ofdoing business, require us to change ou
r business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise havea material eff
ect on our operations. The media, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks.Claims, Litigation, Government Investigat
ions, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of OperationsAs an innovative company offer
ing a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual andthreatened claims, 
litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range ofissues, including patent and oth
er intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy, data use, data protection, data security,network security, consumer pro
tection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The number and scale of theseproceedings have increas
ed over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products, services, and operations have become morecomplex and available 
to, and used by, more people. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of ouroperations, diversion of man
agement resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject tosignificant uncerta
inties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties andunpredictable outcomes. Unt
il the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.Should any of our estimates and assu
mptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position,results of operations, or c
ash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involvelicenses, sanctions, consent d
ecrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us tochange our business practic
es in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies,damaging our reputation, or o
therwise having a material effect on our operations.We Are Subject to Product Liability Clai
ms When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or ManufactureSome of the products we sell or m
anufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental orproperty damage, and can r
equire product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims.Although we maintain liabil
ity insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to beavailable to us on economi
cally reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type ofproducts, we may not be able to de
tect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendorsand sellers do not indemnify us 
from product liability.We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Colle
ction ObligationsWe are subject to a va
riety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additionaltax expense and be subject to 
additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrativepractices, principl
es, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in variousjurisdictions. Such changes could 
come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or haveadopted laws or administra
tive practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods andservices. These include new obl
igations to collect sales,14

Table of Contentsconsumption, value added, or othe
r taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. Forexample, non-U.S. jurisdictions hav
e proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral taxmeasures may continue unl
ess broader international tax reform is implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxesimposed on us prospectively or r
etroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provideinformation about our custo
mers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not havesufficient notice to 
enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.Our tax expense and liabili
ties are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businessesand geographies, intercomp
any transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related taxbenefits, the applicab
ility of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts ofincome and loss and the mix of 
jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the ordinary course of our business,there are many trans
actions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our taxexpense, assets, and liabil
ities.We are also subject to 
tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other taxcontroversy can have a ma
terial effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior andsubsequent periods. We regula
rly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Althoughwe believe our tax estim
ates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historicaltax accruals.
We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Relat
ed Procurement RegulationsOur contracts with U.S., as well as stat
e, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating totheir formation, adm
inistration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result invarious civil and crim
inal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, paymentof fines, and suspension or debarm
ent from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are subject to periodic funding approval and/or provide fortermination by the govern
ment at any time, without cause.Item 1B.

Overview
Our primary source of revenue is the sale o
f a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our s tores include merchandise andcontent we have purchased for 
resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content.Generally, we recognize gross 
revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellersas service sales. We se
ek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other servicessuch as compute, storage, and da
tabase offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainab
le growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven pr imarily by increasing operating income and efficientlymanaging accounts rece
ivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increasesin operating income pri
marily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments wemake in longer-term s
trategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, wefocus on improving all aspec
ts of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasingselection, producing origin
al content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability,and earning customer trus
t. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flowsfinancial measures.
We seek to reduce our variabl
e costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include p roduct and content costs, payment processing andrelated transact
ion costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion ofour marketing costs. Our fixed 
costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores,web services, electroni
c devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment networks and related facilities. Variable costs generally change directlywith sales volume, while fixed 
costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decreaseour variable costs on a per un
it basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reducedefects in our processes. To m
inimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.Because of our model we are able to turn our inv
entory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle.  On average, our high inventory velocity means wegenerally collect 
from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerousfactors, including our produc
t mix, the mix of sales The operating cycle is th
e number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.11

rs, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies andproduct lines, and the exten
t to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time sincethey are affected by s
everal factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in paymentterms over time, inc
luding the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.We expect spending in te
chnology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, andmerchandising employees. Our technology and con
tent investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due togeographic expansion and the cross-func
tionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS,and expansion of new and existing product ca
tegories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve ourprocess efficiencies. 
We believe that advan ces in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wirelessconnectivity, and the 
practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience on the Internet and increase itsubiquity in people’s lives. To bes
t take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demandtechnology services, includ
ing compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services, to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are alsoinvesting in initiativ
es to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices.We seek to effici
ently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, andaligning employee compensation with shareho
lders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock unit s as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe thiscompensation model aligns 
the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stockawards outstanding, without regard 
to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 518 million and 523 million as ofDecember 31, 2020 and 2021.
Our financial reporting currency is 
the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens y
ear-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higherthan if currencies had 
remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidatednet sales and operating exp
enses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy throughour growing international busin
esses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates beforeand after the effe
ct of currency changes.In addition, the remeasu
rement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currencyexchange rates. Currency vol
atilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends andcomparisons.

ion about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 —Description of Business, Accounting Polic
ies, and Supplemental Disclosures.”Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year end
ed December 31, 2020 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations forthe year ended December 31, 2019 
in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Critical Accounting Judgments
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates andassumptions that affec
t the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financialstatements and accomp
anying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of thecompany’s financial cond
ition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the needto make estimates of 
matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below.We also have other key ac
counting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. Foradditional informat
ion, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, andSupplemental Disclosures.” Although we b
elieve that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available.Actual results may diff
er significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.19

Table of ContentsInventories
Inventories, consisting of produ
cts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and netrealizable value. Th
is valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales toindividual customers, re
turns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about futuredisposition of inventory are 
inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measureof sensitivity, for every 1
% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately$370 million.
In addition, we enter
 into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecastedcustomer demand. If we redu
ce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income Taxes
We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, andinterpretations in va
rious jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significantjudgment is required in ev
aluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course ofbusiness for which the ultima
te tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and otherconditions and significant 
judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets.Our effective tax ra
tes could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses andgeographies, intercompany 
transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we havelower statutory rates and h
igher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realizerelated tax benefi
ts, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of incomeand loss and the mix of jurisdi
ctions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations,administrative pra
ctices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules invarious jurisdictions. In add
ition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.We are also current
ly subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us.Developments in an audit, inves
tigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for whichthat development occurs, 
as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings todetermine the adequa
cy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other taxcontroversies could be
 materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.Liquidity and Capital Resources

arily British Pounds, Euros, Japanese Yen, and Canadian Dollars.Cash provided by (used in) operating 
activities was $66.1 billion and $46.3 billion in 2020 and 2021. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash receivedfrom our consumer, selle
r, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employeecompensation, payment proc
essing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customersand other activities g
enerally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly.The decrease in operat
ing cash flow in 2021, compared to the prior year, was20

Table of Contentsprimarily due to changes 
in working capital, partially offset by the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses. Working capital at any specific point in time issubject to many variabl
es, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor paymentterms, and fluctuations 
in foreign exchange rates.Cash provided by (used in) investing a
ctivities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from propertyand equipment vendors, proceeds 
from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales,and maturities of ma
rketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(59.6) billion and $(58.2) billion in 2020 and 2021, with the variabilitycaused primarily by our de
cision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditureswere $35.0 billion, and $55.4 billion in 2020 
and 2021, which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support ofcontinued business growth in technology 
infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), which investments we expect to continue over time. We made cashpayments, net of acquired 
cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion in 2020 and 2021.Cash provided by (used in) financing 
activities was $(1.1) billion and $6.3 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceedsfrom short-term debt, 
and other and long-term-debt of $17.3 billion and $27.0 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from paymentsof short-term debt, and oth
er, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $18.4 billion and $20.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. Property and equipmentacquired under finance 
leases was $11.6 billion and $7.1 billion in 2020 and 2021, reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due toinvestments in technology in
frastructure for AWS.We had no borrowings outstanding under th
e unsecured revolving credit facility, $725 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs,and $803 million of borrowings outstand
ing under our secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, “FinancialStatements and Supplementa
ry Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. As of December 31, 2021, cash, cash equiva
lents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $7.6 billion. We intend to invest substantially all ofour foreign subsidiary earn
ings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incursignificant, additiona
l costs upon repatriation of such amounts.Tax benefits relating 
to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. U.S. tax rulesprovide for enhanced acc
elerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Ourfederal tax provision in
cluded the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2019 and a partial election for 2020 and 2021. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds)were $1.7 billion and $3.7 billion fo
r 2020 and 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized forU.S. tax purposes, which will delay the deduc
tibility of these expenses and potentially increase the amount of cash taxes we pay.As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, restric
ted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $257 million and $260 million. See Item 8 of Part II,“Financial Statements 
and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” and “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies”for additional discussion of ou
r principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders,including for inventory and c
apital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and openpurchase orders are gene
rally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.We believe that cash 
flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements,will be sufficient to m
eet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows aresubject to substantial unc
ertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain creditfacilities, obtain 
finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, orotherwise restructure ou
r debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. We expect to fund the acquisition of MGM Holdings Inc. with cash onhand.
The sale of additional equ
ity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisitionof, or investment in, compl
ementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us tosecure additional fin
ancing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be availablein amounts or on terms acc
eptable to us, if at all.21

Table of ContentsResults of Operations
We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates itsbusiness performance and m
anages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.”Overview
As reflected in the discuss
ion below, ongoing direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response to them had varying effects onour 2021 results of operations, a
lthough some effects, including customer demand, are mitigating or becoming more difficult to isolate or quantify. Moreover, it is notpossible to determine th
e duration and scope of the pandemic, the scale and rate of economic recovery from the pandemic, any ongoing effects on consumer demand andspending patterns, supply chain dis
ruptions, and labor availability and costs, or the impact of other indirect factors that may be attributable to the pandemic, and theextent to which these or othe
r currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations. However, weexpect our net sales growth r
ate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021. In addition, these direct and indirect factors can make itdifficult to isolat
e and quantify the portion of our costs that are a direct result of the pandemic and costs arising from factors that may have been influenced by thepandemic, including increa
sed wage rates and incentives, increased carrier rates, and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from constrained labor markets andglobal supply chain constrain
ts. We expect these factors and their effects on our operations to continue into Q1 2022.22

Table of ContentsNet Sales
Net sales include product and s
ervice sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content wherewe record revenue gross. Servic
e sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales,advertising services, Ama

eased 18% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-partysellers, and advertising s

Cost of sales primarily cons
ists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and deliverycenters and where we are th
e transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.The increase in cost of sa
les in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting fromincreased sales, costs f
rom expanding our fulfillment network, as well as increased carrier rates, increased wage rates and incentives, and fulfillment networkinefficiencies r
esulting from a constrained labor market and global supply chain constraints.Shipping costs to receive produc
ts from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.Shipping costs, which include sortat
ion and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $61.1 billion and $76.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. We expect our cost ofshipping to continue to incre
ase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, includingfaster delivery, and we of
fer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing ourfulfillment network, nego
tiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers isfundamental to our futur
e success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.Costs to operate our AWS segment ar
e primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internaltechnology requirements 
and external sales to AWS customers.Fulfillment
Fulfillment costs prim
arily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, andcustomer service cen
ters and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs areprimarily classif
ied as “Technology and25

Table of Contentscontent.” Fulfillment 
costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level ofproductivity and accura
cy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazonservices, timing of ful
fillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and servicessold, and our ability to aff
ect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-servicefeatures. Additionally, sa
les by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales becausepayment processing costs ar
e based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.The increase in fulfi
llment costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased productand service sales volume 
and inventory levels, increased wage rates and incentives and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from a constrained labor market andglobal supply chain constrain
ts, and costs from expanding our fulfillment network.We seek to expand o
ur fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from salesof our own products as well as sales by th
ird parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.Technology and Content
Technology and content costs inc
lude payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products andservices, development, des
ign, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs.Infrastructure costs 
include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to supportAWS and other Amazon businesses. Collect
ively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.We seek to invest effi
ciently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our processefficiency through rap
id technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projectsoften support a variety of p
roduct and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending intechnology and content to inc
rease over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. Theincrease in technology and 
content costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructureand increased payroll and 
related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce newproducts and service offe
rings. We expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2022 due to increases in the estimated useful lives of our servers andnetworking equipment, which will pr
imarily impact our AWS segment. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Descriptionof Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplem
ental Disclosures — Use of Estimates” for additional information on the change in estimated useful lives of our serversand networking equipment.
Marketing
Marketing costs include adv
ertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissionsrelated to AWS. We direc
t customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and online advertising, thirdparty customer refe
rrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To theextent there is incr
eased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a correspondingchange in our marketing cos
ts.The increase in marke
ting costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to higher marketing spend, which was constrained in 2020in response to COVID-19, and increased payro
ll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities.While costs associated wi
th Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers aseffective worldwide ma
rketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.General and Administrative
The increase in genera
l and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and relatedexpenses and professional fe

abilities were $52.6 billion and $67.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Our long-term debt was $31.8 billion and $48.7 billion asof December 31, 2020 and 2021. See Item 8 o

Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), ne
t was $2.4 billion and $14.6 billion during 2020 and 2021. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related toequity securities valu
ations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net in 2021 is a valuation gain of$11.8 billion from our equity se
curities of Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November 2021.Income Taxes
Our effective tax ra
te is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix ofjurisdictions to which they r
elate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments, 
changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes instatutes, regulations, c
ase law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition,and other laws and accounting ru
les in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. In addition, we recordvaluation allowances aga
inst deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions.We recorded a provision fo
r income taxes of $2.9 billion and $4.8 billion in 2020 and 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data— Note 9 — Income Taxes” for addi
tional information.Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measur
es, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAPfinancial informa
tion. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.
We provide multiple m
easures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property andequipment with cash and through f
inance leases and financing obligations.27

All of these free cash f
lows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cashflow available for disc
retionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principalreductions of debt or cash pay
ments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options maychange over time. There
fore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.Effect of Foreign Exchange Rat

Table of ContentsGuidance
We provided guidance on February 3, 2022, 
in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflectAmazon.com’s expectations 
as of February 3, 2022, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected bymany factors, such as uncer
tainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions andcustomer demand and spending, in
flation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloudservices, as well as those out
lined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” This guidance reflects our estimates as of February 3, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as we
ll as the effect of other factors discussed above.First Quarter 2022 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $112.0 billion and $117.0 billion, or to grow between 3% and 8% compared with first quarter 2021. This guidanceanticipates an unfavor
able impact of approximately 150 basis points from foreign exchange rates.•
Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion, compared with $8.9 billion in first quarter 2021. This guidance includesapproximately $1.0 billion 
lower depreciation expense due to increases in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment beginning onJanuary 1, 2022.
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.30

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market ri
sk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.Information relat
ing to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Oper
ations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk fo
r changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried atamortized cost and flu
ctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixedrate, will generally fluctuate 
with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.We generally invest our 
excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed incomesecurities may have their fair mar
ket value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that havedeclined in market va
lue due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities,including principal cash

Table of ContentsForeign Exchange Risk
During 2021, net sales from our Int
ernational segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from ourinternationally-fo
cused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functionalcurrencies of the cor
responding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompanybalances associated with, ou
r internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange ratesvary, net sales and other ope
rating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompanybalances. For example, as a 
result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net salesincreased by $3.0 billion in co
mparison with the prior year.We have foreign exchange 
risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance offoreign funds as of December 31, 2021, o
f $22.7 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $1.1billion, $2.3 billion, and $4.5 bill
ion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component ofstockholders’ equity. Equity se
curities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measuredat fair value with change
s recognized in net income.We have foreign exchange 
risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as ofDecember 31, 2021, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20
% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $285 million, $575 million, and $1.1 billion,recorded to “Other incom
e (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Man
agement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of ForeignExchange Rates” for addition
al information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.Equity Investment Risk
As of December 31, 2021, our recorded va
lue in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $22.3 billion. Our equity and equitywarrant investments in publ
icly traded companies, which primarily relate to Rivian Automotive, Inc., represent $20.3 billion of our investments as of December 31,2021, and are recorded at f
air value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjustour equity investments in pr
ivate companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lackof readily available market data.
 The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan
cial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures” foradditional information.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the relatedconsolidated statemen
ts of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021,and the related notes (collecti
vely referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in allmaterial respec
ts, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years inthe period ended December 31, 2021, 
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 3, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financ
ial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’sconsolidated financia
l statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to theCompany in accordance with the U.S. fed
eral securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performingprocedures to assess the risks o
f material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond tothose risks. Such procedures includ
ed examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our auditsalso included evaluating 
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidatedfinancial statem
ents. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated
 below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated orrequired to be communicated
 to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2)involved our especially ch
allenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on theconsolidated financia
l statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical auditmatter or on the accoun
ts or disclosures to which it relates.34

Table of ContentsIncome Taxes
Description of 
the Matter
As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerousforeign jurisdictions and du
ring the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination isuncertain. As a result, signi
ficant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision forincome taxes. The Company uses signi
ficant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more likely thannot to be sustained and (2) me
asuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.Auditing the recognition and m
easurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a taxposition is more likely th
an not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex and involvessignificant auditor judg
ment. Management’s evaluation of tax positions may involve the use of valuation methodologies andassumptions, including forec
asts of income or loss, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.How We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit
We tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over theassessment as to whether a t
ax position is more likely than not to be sustained; measurement of the benefit of its tax positions, includingthe selection of valua
tion methodologies and assumptions; determination of forecasts of income or loss; and development of the relateddisclosures.
We involved our internat
ional tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits ofcertain of the Company’s t
ax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with therelevant tax authori
ties relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including theCompany’s correspondence with such t
ax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. Weused our knowledge of and experienc
e with international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws by the relevant income taxauthorities to evaluate the 
Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatoryenvironments to assess potent
ial effects on the Company’s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed theappropriateness of the Company
’s valuation methodologies and assumptions, including the determination of forecasts of income or loss,and the accuracy of the Comp
any’s calculations and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize. We have alsoevaluated the Company’s inco
me tax disclosures in relation to these matters./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, A
CCOUNTING POLICIES, AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURESDescription of Business
We seek to be Earth’s most 
customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers,enterprises, content c
reators, advertisers, and employees. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. Weoffer programs that en
able sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians,filmmakers, Twitch str
eamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, whichoffers a broad set of on-de
mand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufactureand sell electronic d
evices. In addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads,display, and video advertising.
We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.”Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financi
al statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of itswholly-owned subsidiaries and those en
tities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India andcertain entities that support
 our seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.Use of Estimates
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,revenues and expenses, and rel
ated disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but notlimited to, income t
axes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensationforfeiture rates, vendor fu
nding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, and valuation and impairment of investments. Actual results could differ materiallyfrom these estimat
es. For example, in Q4 2021 we completed a useful life study for our servers and networking equipment and are increasing the useful lives from fouryears to five years for s
ervers and from five years to six years for networking equipment in January 2022, which, based on servers and networking equipment that areincluded in “Property and equip
ment, net” as of December 31, 2021, will have an anticipated impact to our 2022 operating income of $3.1 billion. We had previouslyincreased the useful l
ife of our servers from three years to four years in January 2020.Supplemental Cash Flow Information

Table of ContentsEarnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is 
calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common sh
ares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss,stock awards are excluded f
rom our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.The following table shows the cal
culation of diluted shares (in millions):

ic earnings per share494 500 506 Total dilutive effe
ct of outstanding stock awards10 10 9 Shares used in computation of di
luted earnings per share504 510 515 Revenue
Revenue is measured based on the 
amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, andrebates. Revenue also exclud
es any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performanceobligations, the transacti
on price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone sellingprices based on the prices 
charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.A description of our principa
l revenue generating activities is as follows:Retail sales
 - We offer consumer produ cts through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer,which generally occurs upon our de
livery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.Third-party seller services
 - We offer programs th at enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of recordin these transactions. The 
commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered,which generally occurs upon del
ivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.Subscription services
 - Our subscription sales includ e fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks,digital music, e-books, and oth
er non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent asingle stand-ready obliga
tion. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over thesubscription period.
Advertising services
 - We provide advertising s ervices to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, andvideo advertising. Revenue is r
ecognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.AWS
 - Our AWS arrangements include g lobal sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone sellingprices and is primari
ly recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, 
including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Salescommissions we pay in connection wi
th contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.Other
 - Other revenue includes sa les related to various other service offerings, which are recognized as or when those services are performed.Return Allowances
Return allowances, which reduce 
revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in “Accruedexpenses and other” and were $712 m
illion, $859 million, and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Additions to the allowance were $2.5 billion, $3.5billion, and $5.1 billion and deduc
tions from the allowance were $2.5 billion, $3.6 billion, and $4.9 billion in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Included in “Inventories” on ourconsolidated balance she
ets are assets totaling $629 million, $852 million, and $882 million as of December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, for the rights to recover productsfrom customers associa
ted with our liabilities for return allowances.42

Table of ContentsCost of Sales
Cost of sales primarily cons
ists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and deliverycenters and where we are th
e transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping coststo receive products fro
m our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing andrelated transaction costs, i
ncluding those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of operations.Vendor Agreements
We have agreements with ou
r vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. Wegenerally consider thes
e amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and arerecorded as a reduction o
f the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchasethresholds. We evaluate 
the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonablyestimated, we record a po
rtion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.Fulfillment
Fulfillment costs prim
arily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers, physicalstores, and customer servi
ce centers, including facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, and rent; costs attributable to buying, receiving,inspecting, and warehousing invento
ries; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, includingcosts associated with our guar
antee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufacturedelectronic devices. Ful
fillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.Technology and Content
Technology and content costs inc
lude payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products andservices, development, des
ign, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs.Infrastructure costs 
include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to supportAWS and other Amazon businesses. Collect
ively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.Technology and content costs ar
e generally expensed as incurred.Marketing
Marketing costs primar
ily consist of advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including salescommissions related to 
AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertisingarrangements with cer
tain of our vendors, and other third parties.Advertising and other promotion
al costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $11.0 billion, $10.9 billion, and $16.9 billion in2019, 2020, and 2021.
General and Administrative
General and administra
tive expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses,such as depreciation and a
mortization expense and rent; and professional fees.Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for all equ
ity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. Thefair value of restr
icted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expenseover the service period, n
et of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment,and to the extent actua
l results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimatesare revised. We consider ma
ny factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience and employee level. Additionally, stock-basedcompensation includes stock
43

xpected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement orexpiration.
Other Operating Expense (Income), Net
Other operating expense (in
come), net, consists primarily of a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in Q4 2020, offset by alease impairment 
in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets.Other Income (Expense), Net

(expense), net in 2021 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain of $11.8 billion from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive,Inc. (“Rivian”). Our investm
ent in Rivian’s preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior toRivian’s initial public o
ffering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2021, we held158 million shares of Rivian’s Cl
ass A common stock, representing an approximate 18% ownership interest, and an approximate 16% voting interest. We determinedthat we have the ability 
to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles,and one of our employees serving on Riv
ian’s board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, and the 2021 valuationgain is primarily comp
rised of the gain recognized upon the initial public offering, and also includes subsequent changes in fair value through December 31, 2021. As ofDecember 31, 2021, our equity invest
ment in Rivian had a fair value of $15.6 billion, which reflects a discount for lack of marketability until Q1 2022 of approximately$800 million due to regulato
ry sales restrictions, and is included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets.Summarized financia

Table of ContentsIncome Taxes
Income tax expense includ
es U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxationand the subsequent repatri
ation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as ourcapital in our foreign subs
idiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of suchamounts.
Deferred income tax balances
 reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as netoperating loss and tax cred
it carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.Deferred tax assets represe
nt amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization andreduced by a valuation al
lowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of ourdeferred tax assets, in
cluding our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods availabl
e to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.We utilize a two-step 
approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position forrecognition by determin
ing if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of relatedappeals or litigation p
rocesses. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimatesettlement. We consid
er many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may notaccurately forecast actual outcomes
. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as th
e price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at themeasurement date. To in
crease the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fairvalue:
Level 1 
— Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.Level 2
 — Valuations based on observable inpu ts other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities inactive markets, quoted price
s for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can becorroborated by observable 
market data.Level 3 
— Valuations based on unobservable inpu ts reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by othermarket participan
ts. These valuations require significant judgment.We measure the fair value of m
oney market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets orliabilities. Other marketable sec
urities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instrumentsand other significant inpu
ts derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.
We hold equity warrants giving us 
the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, these warrants had a fair value of $3.0billion and $3.4 billion, and ar
e recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in “Other income (expense), net” onour consolidated statem
ents of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.Cash and Cash Equivalents
We classify all highly 
liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.Inventories
Inventories, consisting of produ
cts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and netrealizable value. Th
is valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales toindividual customers, re
turns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance,representing a write-down of 
inventory, was $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.45

Table of ContentsWe provide Fulfillment by Am
azon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory,regardless of whether ful
fillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.We also purchase electronic 
device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for ourproducts. During the normal cours
e of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contractmanufacturers and suppli
ers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm,non-cancellable commitments. T
hese commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We alsohave firm, non-cancel
lable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.Accounts Receivable, Net and Other
Included in “Accounts rece
ivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As ofDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, customer r
eceivables, net, were $14.8 billion and $20.2 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $4.8 billion and $5.3 billion, and sellerreceivables, net, were $381 
million and $1.0 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding tosellers primarily 
to procure inventory.We estimate losses on r
eceivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that 
all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was$718 million, $1.1 billion, and $1.1 bil
lion as of December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Additions to the allowance were $1.0 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.0 billion, anddeductions to the allowance we
re $793 million, $1.0 billion, and $1.1 billion in 2019, 2020, and 2021.Software Development Costs
We incur software develop
ment costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Softwaredevelopment costs capit
alized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred.Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipme
nt are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors arerecorded as a reduction 
to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangementswhen we have control over the build
ing during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networkingequipment, heavy equipment, 
and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of theassets (generally the 
lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years prior to January 1, 2020 and four years subsequent to January 1, 2020for our servers, five yea
rs for networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three  to ten years for other fu lfillment equipment). Depreciation andamortization expense 
is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.Leases
We categorize leases with co
ntractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us tosubstantially utiliz
e or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in “Property and equipment, net.” All other leasesare categorized as operating lea
ses. Our leases generally have terms that range from one  to ten years for equipment and one  to twenty years for property.Certain lease contra
cts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of property, we account for these otherservices as a component of 
the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other servicescomponents based on estimat
ed stand-alone prices.Lease liabilities 
are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly securedborrowings available to us. Leas
e assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any directcosts from executing the
 leases or lease prepayments reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost andamortized over the lesser of
 their expected useful life or the lease term.46

Table of ContentsWhen we have the o
ption to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonablycertain that we will ex
ercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable paymentsbased on measures that inc
lude changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.Costs associated with operating 
lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets areamortized within opera
ting expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer atthe end of the lease te
rm, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest methodover the lease term.
We establish assets and l
iabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assetsare amortized over the lease peri
od into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.Financing Obligations
We record assets and li
abilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during theconstruction period. If we con
tinue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. Thebuilding is depreciated ov
er the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.If we do not control the building 
after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease asoperating.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We evaluate goodwill and ind
efinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change thatindicate the carrying value ma
y not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of areporting unit or indefin
ite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reportingunit and indefinite-lived i
ntangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment lossfor the difference. 
We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of futurenet sales and operating exp
enses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.We completed the requ
ired annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2021, resulting in noimpairments. The fai
r value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test.See “Note 5 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired 
Intangible Assets.”Other Assets
Included in “Other as
sets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; acquiredintangible assets, net 
of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and certain equity investments.Digital Video and Music Content
We obtain video content, in
clusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range oflicensing provisions including bo
th fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonablyestimable and the cont
ent is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made andwe amortize the asset 
to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is notdeterminable or re
asonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which theproduction costs are capi
talized and amortized to “Cost of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content.The weighted average rem
aining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years.Our produced and licensed video con
tent is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer AmazonPrime memberships. The
se film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than thecarrying value. The tota
l capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $6.8 billion and $10.7billion.

Table of ContentsTotal video and music expense was $11.0 b
illion and $13.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2021. Total video and music expense includes licensingand production costs associat
ed with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.Investments
We generally invest our 
excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Suchinvestments are includ
ed in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.Marketable fixed income securitie
s are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated othercomprehensive income (
loss).” Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as ourability and intent to hold 
the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through “Other income (expense), net”on our consolidated statem
ents of operations.Equity investments in priva
te companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, with adjustments forobservable changes in pric
es or impairments, and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in “Other income(expense), net” on our consolid
ated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired.Our assessment includes a rev
iew of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If theinvestment is impair
ed, we write it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, these investments had a carrying value of $2.7 billion and $603million.
Equity investments are a
ccounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value option, if the investment gives us the abilityto exercise signific
ant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets.Our share of the earnings or loss
es as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, arerecognized in “Equity-m
ethod investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fairvalue below carrying value 
are other-than-temporary and if so, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value.Equity investments that hav
e readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, are included in “Marketablesecurities” on our consolid
ated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements ofoperations.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, other than goodwi
ll and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicatethat the carrying amoun
t of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in theobservable market valu
e of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicatethat the carrying amoun
t of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.For long-lived assets used in oper
ations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through itsundiscounted, probability-weigh
ted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value.Long-lived assets are consid
ered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is availablefor sale in its immed
iate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value lesscosts to sell. Assets held for sa
le were not significant as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.Accrued Expenses and Other
Included in “Accrued e
xpenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations, tax-relatedliabilities, payroll and related
 expenses, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities, current debt, acquired digital media content, and otheroperating expenses.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, our liabil
ities for payroll related expenses were $7.6 billion and $9.1 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were$4.7 billion and $5.2 billion. We r
educe the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed isrecognized based on custome
r usage patterns.48

Table of ContentsUnearned Revenue
Unearned revenue is record
ed when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period.Unearned revenue primar
ily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2020 was $11.6billion, of which $9.3 billion was re
cognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $14.0billion. Included in “Other 
long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2020 and2021.
Additionally, we have perform
ance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yetbeen recognized in our fin
ancial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $80.4 billion as ofDecember 31, 2021. The weighted aver
age remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.8 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largelydriven by customer usage, which c
an extend beyond the original contractual term.Other Long-Term Liabilities
Included in “Other lo
ng-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing obligations, asset retirement obligations,deferred tax liabi
lities, unearned revenue, tax contingencies, and digital video and music content.Foreign Currency
We have internationa
lly-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, aredenominated in local fun
ctional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the localcurrency. Assets and liabil
ities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated ataverage rates preva
iling throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component ofstockholders’ equity, and in th
e “Foreign currency effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash,” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gainsand losses including interco
mpany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income(expense), net” on our consolid
ated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses)of $(95) million, $(118) mi

Includes non-cancellable financing obligations for fulfillment, sortation, and data center facilities. Excluding interest, current financing obligations of $111 millionand $196 million are reco
rded within “Accrued expenses and other” and $3.4 billion and $6.2 billion are recorded within “Other long-term liabilities” as ofDecember 31, 2020 and 2021. The weighted-av
erage remaining term of the financing obligations was 19.0 and 18.8 years and the weighted-average imputedinterest rate was 3.8% and 3.2
% as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.(2)
Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the consolidatedbalance sheets and cer
tain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimatethe total obligation beyond 
any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at theoption of the content provide
r are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified.(3)
Includes the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are underconstruction, asset retirement
 obligations, and liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year.(4)
Excludes approximately $3.2 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, ifany.
In addition, in May 2021, we entered 
into an agreement to acquire MGM Holdings Inc. (“MGM”) for approximately $8.5 billion, including MGM’s debt, subjectto customary closing condit
ions. We expect to fund this acquisition with cash on hand.Suppliers
During 2021, no vendor accounted for 10% or 
more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors toguarantee the availability of merc
handise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits.57

Table of ContentsOther Contingencies
We are disputing clai
ms and denials of refunds or credits related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similartaxes), including in jurisd
ictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax controversies typically relate to (i) the taxability of productsand services, including cross
-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with third parties, and (iii) the adequacy of compliancewith reporting obligations, in
cluding evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial andregulatory processes in c
ertain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversies may be materially different from our expectations.Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from tim
e to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, In
c. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Thecomplaint alleges, a
mong other things, that the use of “interactive features” on www.amazon.com, including “search suggestions and search results,” infringes U.S.Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled “Distribu
ted Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display ofEmbedded Objects Within A Hypermed
ia Document.” The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys’ fees. In February 2016,Eolas filed an amended co
mplaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in theevent of a finding of liab
ility Amazon could be subject to $130-$250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court forthe Northern District of Cal
ifornia. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court forthe Northern District of New York. The co
mplaint alleges, among other things, that “Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices” infringe U.S. Patent No.7,177,798, entitled “Natural Langu
age Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.” The complaint seeks an injunction, an unspecified amount ofdamages, enhanced damages, 
an ongoing royalty, pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend todefend ourselves vigorously in th
is matter.In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed 
a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Thecomplaint alleges, a
mong other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, both entitled “Network DistributedTracking Wire Transfe
r Protocol,” and 7,233,978, entitled “Method And Apparatus For Managing Location Information In A Network Separate From The Data ToWhich The Location Inform
ation Pertains.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and injunctiverelief. We dispute th
e allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.Beginning in March 2020, with Frame-W
ilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, a number ofcases have been filed in 
the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and third-party sellers in Amazon’sstores, monopolization and a
ttempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Some of the cases include allegations of several distinctpurported classes, including 
consumers who purchased a product through Amazon’s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through anothere-commerce retailer. The complaints 
seek billions of dollars of alleged actual damages, treble damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief. Individuals have alsoinitiated arbitr
ations based on substantially similar allegations. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.In November 2020, the European Commission 
issued a Statement of Objections alleging that Amazon uses data relating to our marketplace sellers in a mannerthat infringes EU competi
tion rules. The Statement of Objections seeks to impose unspecified fines and remedial actions. We disagree with the preliminary assertions ofthe European Commission and intend 
to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.In July 2021, the Luxembourg National Comm
ission for Data Protection (the “CNPD”) issued a decision against Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l. claiming thatAmazon’s processing of personal d
ata did not comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The decision imposes a fine of €746 million and correspondingpractice revisions. W
e believe the CNPD’s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.In November 2021, Jawbone Innovations, LLC filed 
a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services, Inc. in the United States District Court forthe Eastern District of T
exas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon Echo smart speakers and displays, Fire TV Cube, and Echo Buds infringe U.S.Patent Nos. 7,246,058, entitled “Detec
ting Voiced and Unvoiced Speech Using Both Acoustic and Nonacoustic Sensors”; 8,019,091, entitled “Voice Activity58

icrophone Array (DOMA).” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs,interest, and injunctiv
e relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.In December 2021, the Ital
ian Competition Authority (the “ICA”) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.à r.l., Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l.,Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon Italia Serv
ices S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming that certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringedEU competition rules. The dec
ision imposes a fine of €1.13 billion and remedial actions. We believe the ICA’s decision to be without merit and intend to defendourselves vigorously in this ma
tter.In January 2022, VideoLabs, Inc. and VL Collect
ive IP LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Wes
tern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Glow, Amazon Echo Show, Fire TV,Fire TV Cube, Fire TV Stick, Fire Tablets, AWS Elem
ental MediaConvert, AWS Elemental Live, AWS Elemental Server, AWS Elemental MediaPackage, AWSElemental MediaLive, 
and Amazon Elastic Transcoder infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,769,238 and 8,139,878, both entitled “Picture Coding Method and Picture DecodingMethod”; and 7,970,059, entitled “Va
riable Length Coding Method and Variable Length Decoding Method”; that Amazon Prime Video, AWS ElementalMediaConvert, AWS Elemental Liv
e, AWS Elemental Server, AWS Elemental MediaPackage, AWS Elemental MediaLive, Amazon Elastic Transcoder, and AmazonKinesis Video Streams infringe U.S. Paten
t No. 8,605,794, entitled “Method for Synchronizing Content-Dependent Data Segments of Files”; that Amazon Echo Show,Amazon Echo Spot, Amazon Connect, Amazon Chime, and Am

e Method and Apparatus to Automatically Activate Spare Servers”; and that Amazon Prime Video infringes U.S.Patent No. 7,440,559, entitled “System and Assoc
iated Terminal, Method and Computer Program Product for Controlling the Flow of Content.” The complaint seeks anunspecified amount of dam
ages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defendourselves vigorously in this ma
tter.In addition, we are regula
rly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectualproperty matters, tax
es, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and servicesoffered by us and by third part
ies, and other matters.The outcomes of our legal pro
ceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to ouroperating results and cash 
flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affectthe amount of liabili
ty, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to ouraccruals and disclosures 
as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is notpossible or is immater
ial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetaryremedies. Until the fin
al resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excessof the amounts recorded, which 
could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.See also “Note 9 — Income Taxes.”

Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our tax provision includes $1.4 billion, $1.8 billion, and$1.9 billion of excess tax bene
fits from stock-based compensation for 2019, 2020, and 2021.(2)
U.S. companies are eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on certain foreign income. This regime is referred to as the Foreign-Derived IntangibleIncome deduction (“FDII”).
Our provision for income taxes 
in 2020 was higher than in 2019 primarily due to an increase in pretax income. This was partially offset by the impact ofdevelopments in our ongoing global 
tax controversies on taxes related to our foreign earnings and losses, an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-basedcompensation, and an incre
ase in our foreign income deduction under FDII. In addition, our Luxembourg operations generated earnings in 2020 and utilized deferred taxassets previously subject to v
aluation allowances.Our provision for income taxes 
in 2021 was higher than in 2020 primarily due to an increase in pretax income. This was partially offset by an increase in U.S.federal research 
and development credits and the impact of the distribution of certain intangible assets from Luxembourg to the U.S. in Q4 2021, resulting in theutilization of $2.6 bill
ion of Luxembourg deferred tax assets previously subject to a valuation allowance.We intend to invest substant
ially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in thosejurisdictions in which we would incur s
ignificant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.62

Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions.Our valuation allowances pri
marily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards as ofDecember 31, 2021. Our foreign net ope
rating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of December 31, 2021 were approximately $9.2 billion before tax effectsand certain of these a
mounts are subject to annual limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2022.Tax Contingencies
We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positionsand determining our provision 
for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate taxdetermination is unce
rtain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Thesereserves are establ
ished when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust thesereserves in light of chang
ing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions andchanges to reserves that
 are considered appropriate.The reconciliation of ou

Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we had accrued 
interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $83 million and $110million. Interest and p
enalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 was $4 million, $(48) million, and$28 million.
We are under examina
tion, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. Theseexaminations may lead 
to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as wellas subsequent periods. We resolv
ed the audits of tax years 2007 through 2015 with the IRS for amounts that were materially consistent with our accrual.In October 2014, the European Commission op
ened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to thecorporate income tax p
aid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced itsdecision that determ
inations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the EuropeanCommission announced an estima
ted recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and orderedLuxembourg tax authorities 
to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with theEuropean Commission’s decision, which we d
eposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017,Luxembourg appealed the Europe
an Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the EuropeanCommission’s state aid dec
ision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselvesvigorously in this matter. 
We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg,and the United Kingdom. We are unde
r, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particularjurisdictions primarily for 
2009 and thereafter.Changes in tax laws, regulations, ad
ministrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of incometax controversies is highly un
certain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amountsaccrued. It is reasonab
ly possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution ofincome tax controversi
es in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years’tax filings. The actual 
amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide anestimate of the rang
e of possible outcomes.Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION
We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses“Fulfillment,” “Techno
logy and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costsare incurred. The majo
rity of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructuretechnology costs are incur
red in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments.These segments reflec
t the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations.North America
The North America segment pr
imarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through NorthAmerica-focused online 
and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores.International
The International segm
ent primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions throughinternationally-fo
cused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online storesto customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canad
a), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.AWS
The AWS segment consists of amounts e
arned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies,and academic institutions.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We carried out an eva
luation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of our principalexecutive officer 
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)of the 1934 Act, as of December 31, 2021. Based on 
this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31,2021, our disclosure controls and pro
cedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file orsubmit under the 1934 Act is reco
rded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonableassurance that such inf
ormation is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, asappropriate to allow ti
mely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible 
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act.Management has assessed the 
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control —Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, managementconcluded that, as of Decemb
er 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability offinancial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst & Young hasindependently assessed the e
ffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no change
s in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonablylikely to materially affect, our i
nternal control over financial reporting.Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and proc
edures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives asspecified above. Managem
ent does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detectall error and fraud. Any cont
rol system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance that its obje
ctives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or thatall control issues and inst
ances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.68

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Amazon.com, 
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control —Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) m
aintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSOcriteria.
We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balancesheets of the Company as of Decemb
er 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cashflows for each of the thre
e years in the period ended December 31, 2021 and the related notes and our report dated February 3, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinionthereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s mana
gement is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness ofinternal control over 
financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company’s int
ernal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and arerequired to be independent wi
th respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities andExchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an und
erstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluatingthe design and operating ef
fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over F
inancial ReportingA company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions anddispositions of the assets of th
e company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements inaccordance with genera
lly accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations ofmanagement and direc
tors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, ordisposition of the c
ompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with thepolicies or procedures m
ay deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

 the Employer. You further acknowledge that (i) neither the Company nor the Employer make any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment ofany Tax-Related
 Items in connection with any aspect of the Award including without limitation, the grant, vesting, or settlement of the Award or the subsequent sale ofShares

 Tax-Related Items by wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, or such other means as the Company may establish or permit. If you have made anelection
 to satisfy your obligation for Tax-Related Items by wire transfer or other means and, as determined by the Company, have not adequately funded the obligationfor
 Tax-Related  Items  within  five  business  days  before  a  Vest  Date  for  this  Award  or  any  other  award  of  restricted  stock  units  granted  to  you  under  the  Plan,  theCompany reserves the right to s
atisfy your obligation for Tax-Related Items pursuant to the method described above in 9(b)(i).(c)
Right  to Retain Shares or Cash. The  Company may refuse to issue or deliver any Shares or the proceeds from the sale of Shares to youuntil the obligation for

 the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. You agree to pay to the Company or the Employer anyamount
 of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot besatisfied by the means des

 and  either  the  Company  or  the  Required  Lenders  shall  so  request,  the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Lenders  and  the  Company  shallnegotiate
 in good faith to amend such requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP (subject to the approvalof
 the Required Lenders and the Borrowers); provided  that,  until so amended, (i) such requirement shall continue to be computed in accordancewith
 GAAP prior to such change therein and (ii) the Company shall provide to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders financial statements andother
 documents required under this Agreement or as reasonably requested hereunder setting forth a reconciliation between calculations of suchrequirement made before and after giving effect to such change in GAAP.
(c)
Consolidation  of  Variable  Interest  Entities.  All  references  herein  to  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Company  and  itsSubsidiaries
 or to the determination of any amount for the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or any similar reference shall, ineach
 case, be deemed to include each variable interest entity that the Company is required to consolidate pursuant to FASB ASC 810 as if suchvariable interest entity were a Subsidiary as defined herein.
1.04
Exchange  Rates.  The Administrative Agent shall determine the Dollar Equivalent of any Loan denominated in an AlternativeCurrency
 as of each applicable Revaluation Date, in each case using the Exchange Rate for such Alternative Currency in relation to Dollars, andeach such amount shall be the Dollar Equivalent of such Loan until the next required calculation thereof pursuant to this sentence.
1.05
Additional Alternative Currencies . (a)
A Borrower may from time to time request that Loans be made in a currency other than those specifically listed in the definition of “Alternative
 Currency”; provided  that  such  requested  currency  is  a  lawful  currency  (other  than  Dollars)  that  is  readily  available  and  freelytransferable and convertible into Dollars.
(b)
Any  such request shall be made to the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m., ten (10) Business Days prior to the date ofthe
 desired Borrowing (or such other time or date as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion). The Administrative Agentshall
 promptly  notify  each  Lender  of  any  such  request.  Each  Lender  shall  notify  the  Administrative  Agent,  not  later  than  1:00  p.m.,  five  (5)Business Days after receipt of such request whether it consents, in its sole discretion, to the making of Loans in such requested currency.
(c)
Any  failure by a Lender to respond to such request within the time period specified in the preceding sentence shall be deemed tobe

1.08
Interest Rate; Benchmark Notification .  The interest rate on a Loan denominated in Dollars or any Alternative Currency may bederived
 from an interest rate benchmark that is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Regulators have signaled the needto
 use alternative benchmark reference rates for some of these interest rate benchmarks and, as a result, such interest rate benchmarks may ceaseto
 comply  with  applicable  Laws,  may  be  permanently  discontinued,  and/or  the  basis  on  which  they  are  calculated  may  change.  The  Londoninterbank
 offered  rate  is  intended  to  represent  the  rate  at  which  contributing  banks  may  obtain  short-term  borrowings  from  each  other  in  theLondon
 interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuadeor compel
 contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE BenchmarkAdministrator,
 the “IBA ”) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022,the
 London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determinethe
 interest rate on LIBOR Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify newor alternative reference rates to
 be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or anEarly
 Opt-In  Election, Section  3.03(b) provides  a  mechanism  for  determining  an  alternative  rate  of  interest.  The  Administrative  Agent  willpromptly
 notify the Company, pursuant to Section  3.03(b),  of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans isbased.
 However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, theadministration,
 submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or with respect to any alternative or successor ratethereto,
 or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant toSection
 3.03(b),  whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, and (ii) the implementation of anyBenchmark
 Replacement  Conforming  Changes  pursuant  to Section  3.03(b)),  including,  without  limitation,  whether  the  composition  orcharacteristics
 of  any  such  alternative,  successor  or  replacement  reference  rate  will  be  similar  to,  or  produce  the  same  value  or  economicequivalence
 of,  the  LIBO  Rate  or  have  the  same  volume  or  liquidity  as  did  the  London  interbank  offered  rate  prior  to  its  discontinuance  orunavailability.
1.09
Divisions .  For all purposes under this Agreement, in connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or anycomparable
 event  under  a  different  jurisdiction’s  laws):  (a)  if  any  asset,  right,  obligation  or  liability  of  any  Person  becomes  the  asset,  right,obligation or liability of a
 different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person, and(b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized and acquired on the first date of its existence
by the holders of its capital stock or similar equity interests at such time.
ARTICLE II.

 the applicable notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (i) four Business Days prior to the requesteddate
 of  such  borrowing,  conversion  or  continuation  of  Eurocurrency  Rate  Loans  denominated  in  Dollars,  or  (ii)  five  Business  Days  (or  sixBusiness Days in the case of a Special Notice Currency) prior to the requested date of such borrowing or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans
denominated
 in  Alternative  Currencies,  whereupon  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  give  prompt  notice  to  the  Lenders  of  such  request  anddetermine
 whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all of them. Not later than 1:00 p.m. (i) three Business Days before the requesteddate
 of  such  borrowing,  conversion  or  continuation  of  Eurocurrency  Rate  Loans  denominated  in  Dollars,  or  (ii)  four  Business  Days  (or  fiveBusiness Days in the case of a Special Notice Currency) prior to the requested date of such borrowing or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans
denominated
 in Alternative Currencies, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and the applicable Borrower (which notice may be bytelephone) whether or not the
 requested Interest Period has been consented to by all the Lenders. Each borrowing of, conversion to or continuationof
 Eurocurrency  Rate  Loans  shall  be  in  an  aggregate  amount  that  is  an  integral  multiple  of  the  Borrowing  Multiple  and  not  less  than  theBorrowing Minimum.
 Each borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans or borrowing of SONIA Loans shall be in an aggregate amount that isan
 integral  multiple  of  the  Borrowing  Multiple  and  not  less  than  the  Borrowing  Minimum.  Each  Loan  Notice  shall  specify  (i)  whether  theapplicable
 Borrower  is  requesting  a  borrowing  of  Loans,  a  conversion  of  Loans  denominated  in  Dollars  from  one  Type  to  another  or  acontinuation

 or continuation shall apply to Loans comprising the same existing Borrowing, it being understood that the applicable Borrower mayelect
 different conversion or continuation options with respect to different portions of the affected existing Borrowing, in which case each suchportion
 shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portionshall be considered a separate
 Borrowing. If the applicable Borrower fails to specify a currency in a Loan Notice requesting a borrowing of Loans,then
 the  Loans  so  requested  shall  be  made  in  Dollars.  If  the  applicable  Borrower  fails  to  specify  a  Type  of  Loan  in  a  Loan  Notice  or  if  theapplicable Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or
30

continuation  of  any  Eurocurrency  Rate  Borrowing  then  the  applicable  Loans  shall  be  made  as,  or  continued  as,  (i)  in  the  case  of  Loansdenominated
 in Dollars, LIBOR Loans, (ii) in the case of Loans denominated in Euros, EURIBOR Loans, (iii) in the case of Loans denominatedin Yen, TIBOR Loans and (iv) in the case of Loans denominated in Sterling, SONIA Loans, in each case (other than in the case of SONIA Loans),
with
 an Interest Period of one month. Any such automatic continuation as Eurocurrency Rate Loans with an Interest Period of one month shall beeffective
 as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing. If the applicableBorrower
 requests a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify anInterest
 Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. No Loan may be converted into or continued as a Loandenominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency.
(b)
Following  receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the details thereof and, in thecase
 of a Loan Notice requesting a borrowing of Loans, of the amount (and currency) of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Loans, and ifno
 timely notice of a conversion or continuation of any Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing is provided by the applicable Borrower, the AdministrativeAgent
 shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic continuation as Eurocurrency Rate Loans as described in the preceding subsection.In
 the case of a borrowing of Loans, each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds atthe
 Administrative Agent’s Office for the applicable currency not later than 1:00 p.m., in the case of any Loan denominated in Dollars (or, in thecase
 of a Base Rate Loans with respect to which a Loan Notice was delivered after 11:00 a.m. on the date of such borrowing, not later than twohours
 after the delivery of such Loan Notice), and not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of anyLoan
 denominated in an Alternative Currency, in each case on the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice. The AdministrativeAgent
 shall  make  all  funds  so  received  available  to  the  applicable  Borrower  in  like  funds  as  received  by  the  Administrative  Agent  either  by(i)
 crediting the account of such Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of suchfunds,
 in  each  case  in  accordance  with  instructions  provided  to  (and  reasonably  acceptable  to)  the  Administrative  Agent  by  the  applicableBorrower.
(c)
Except  as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an InterestPeriod
 for such Eurocurrency Rate Loan. During the existence of an Event of Default, upon the request of the Required Lenders, (i) no Loansdenominated

 Outstanding Amount of all Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies at such time exceeds an amount equal to 105% of the AlternativeCurrency
 Sublimit then in effect or (ii) other than as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the Outstanding Amount of all Loansdenominated
 in Alternative  Currencies at such time exceeds  the Alternative Currency Sublimit then  in effect, then, in either  case, within twoBusiness
 Days  after  receipt  of  such  notice,  the  Borrowers  shall  prepay  Loans  denominated  in  Alternative  Currencies  in  an  aggregate  amountsufficient
 to reduce such Outstanding Amount as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Alternative Currency Sublimitthen in effect.

 if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the AggregateCommitments,
 and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments, the Alternative Currency Sublimit exceeds theamount
 of the Aggregate Commitments, the Alternative Currency Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. TheAdministrative

Fee s.(a)
Commitment  Fee.  The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender in accordance with itsApplicable
 Percentage,  a  commitment  fee  in  Dollars  equal  to  the  Applicable  Rate times  the  actual  daily  amount  by  which  the  AggregateCommitments

2.08
Computation  of  Interest  and  Fees.  All  computations  of  interest  for  Base  Rate  Loans  when  the  Base  Rate  is  determined  byreference
 to the Prime Rate and all computations of interest by reference to the Daily Simple SONIA shall be made on the basis of a year of 365or
 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed (including the first day, but excluding the last day). All other computations of fees andinterest
 shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (including the first day, but excluding the last day) (which results inmore
 fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year), or, in the case of interest in respect of Loansdenominated
 in Alternative Currencies as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice. Interestshall
 accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which theLoan
 or such portion is paid; provided  that  any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section  2.10(a),  bearinterest
 for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for allpurposes,
 absent manifest error. With respect to all Alternative Currencies, the calculation of the applicable interest rate shall be determined inaccordance with market practice.
2.09
Evidence  of Debt. The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by suchLender
 and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent andeach
 Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest andpayments
 thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowershereunder
 to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained byany
 Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the AdministrativeAgent
 shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender to a Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, suchBorrower
 shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans to suchBorrower
 in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to a Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable),amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
2.10
Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback . (a)
General .  All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for anycounterclaim,
 defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest onLoans
 denominated  in  an  Alternative  Currency,  all  payments  by  the  Borrowers  hereunder  shall  be  made  to  the  Administrative  Agent,  for  theaccount
 of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars and in Same DayFunds
 not  later  than  4:00  p.m.  on  the  date  specified  herein.  Except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  herein,  all  payments  by  the  Borrowershereunder
 with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, forthe
 account  of  the  respective  Lenders  to  which  such  payment  is  owed,  at  the  applicable  Administrative  Agent’s  Office  in  such  AlternativeCurrency and
 in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Withoutlimiting
 the generality of the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that it is required to do so for legal, operational orregulatory reasons, the Administrative Agent
 may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. For purposesof the preceding sentence, a payment
34

shall be treated as made in the United States if a wire transfer is made through a bank located in the United States at the direction of a Borrower.If,
 for  any  reason,  any  Borrower  is  prohibited  by  any  Law  from  making  any  required  payment  hereunder  in  an  Alternative  Currency,  suchBorrower
 shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agentwill
 promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds asreceived
 by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 4:00 p.m., in the case ofpayments
 in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency,shall
 in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If anypayment
 to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following BusinessDay, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
(b)
(i)    Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless  the Administrative Agent shall have received notice froma
 Lender  prior  to  the  proposed  date  of  any  borrowing  of  Loans  that  such  Lender  will  not  make  available  to  the  Administrative  Agent  suchLender’s
 share  of  such  borrowing,  the  Administrative  Agent  may  assume  that  such  Lender  has  made  such  share  available  on  such  date  inaccordance
 with Section 2.02  and  may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. Insuch
 event,  if a  Lender  has  not  in  fact made  its  share  of  the  applicable Borrowing  available  to  the  Administrative  Agent, then  the  applicableLender
 and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in SameDay
 Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding thedate
 of  payment  to  the  Administrative  Agent,  at  (A)  in  the  case  of  a  payment  to  be  made  by  such  Lender,  the  rate  determined  by  theAdministrative
 Agent in accordance with banking industry rules and conventions on interbank compensation (or, if such payment is in Dollars, ifgreater,
 the NYFRB Rate), plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connectionwith
 the  foregoing,  and  (B)  in  the  case  of  a  payment  to  be  made  by  the  Borrower,  the  interest  rate  applicable  to  the  Loans  comprising  suchBorrowing.
 If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, theAdministrative
 Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lenderpays
 its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included insuch

 from  a  Borrower  prior  to  the  date  on  which  any  payment  is  due  to  the  Administrative  Agent  for  the  account  of  the  Lendershereunder
 that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made suchpayment
 on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. Insuch
 event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the AdministrativeAgent
 forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from andincluding the
 date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the rate determinedby the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules and conventions on interbank compensation (or, if such payment is

Obligations  of  Lenders  Several.  The  obligations  of  the  Lenders  hereunder  to  make  Loans  and  to  make  payments  pursuant  toSection 11.04(c)
 or 11.05 are several and not  joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under Section 11.04(c)  or 11.05
 on  any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shallbe responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under 
Section 11.04(c)  or 11.05. (e)

 of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of theaggregate
 amount of such Loans and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receivingsuch
 greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loansof
 the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lendersratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; 
provided  that: (i)
if  any  such  participations  are  purchased  and  all  or  any  portion  of  the  payment  giving  rise  thereto  is  recovered,  suchparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
(ii)
the  provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of any Borrowerpursuant
 to  and  in  accordance  with  the  express  terms  of  this  Agreement  (for  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)(including
 the  application  of  funds  arising  from  the  existence  of  a  Defaulting  Lender)  or  (y)  any  payment  obtained  by  a  Lender  asconsideration
 for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Companyor any other Borrower or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
Each
 Loan  Party  consents  to  the  foregoing  and  agrees,  to  the  extent  it  may  effectively  do  so  under  applicable  Law,  that  any  Lenderacquiring

    if  a  payment  made  to  a  Lender  under  any  Loan  Document  would  be  subject  to  U.S.  federal  withholding  Taximposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply
43

 this Section, it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additionalamounts paid, by a Loan Party under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including
Taxes)
 incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to suchrefund);

 interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required torepay
 such  refund  to  such  Governmental  Authority.  This  subsection  shall  not  be  construed  to  require  any  Recipient  to  make  available  its  taxreturns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.
(g)

 Taxes  for  which  additional  amounts  have  been  paid  or  are  due  under  this Section  3.01,  the  Administrative  Agent  or  Lender  (asapplicable)
 shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with such Loan Party in challenging such Indemnified Taxes, at the Loan Party’s expense, ifso

 that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined byreference to
 the Relevant Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Relevant Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposedmaterial
 restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the relevantinterbank
 market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender tomake or continue
44

Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SONIA Loans, as applicable, in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans inDollars,
 to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lendermaking
 or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate component of the Base Rate, theinterest
 rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agentwithout
 reference  to  the  LIBO  Rate  component  of  the  Base  Rate,  in  each  case  until  such  Lender  notifies  the  Administrative  Agent  and  theCompany
 that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrowers shall, upondemand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay all Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SONIA Loans, as applicable, of such
Lender in
 the affected currency or currencies or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans ofsuch
 Lender in Dollars to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality,be
 determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBO Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the InterestPeriod therefor,
 if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender maynot
 lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and in the case of SONIA Loans, and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality ofsuch
 Lender  determining  or  charging  interest  rates  based  upon  the  LIBO  Rate,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  during  the  period  of  suchsuspension
 compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBO Rate component thereof until the AdministrativeAgent
 is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBORate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

 to  banks  in  the  relevant  interbank  market  for  such  currency  for  the  applicable  amount  and  Interest  Period  of  such  Eurocurrency  RateBorrowing,
 or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining (x) the LIBO Rate, the EURIBO Rate or the TIBO Rate, as thecase
 may be, for the requested Interest Period with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing (including because the Relevant Screen Rate isnot
 available or published on a current basis) or (y) the Daily Simple SONIA with respect to any SONIA Borrowing, or (ii) the AdministrativeAgent
 or the Required Lenders reasonably determine that for any reason the LIBO Rate, the EURIBO Rate or the TIBO Rate for the requestedInterest

 and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing or SONIA Borrowing, as applicable, theAdministrative

 and  (B)  any  Loan  Notice  that  requests  the  making  of  a  LIBOR  Borrowing  shall  be  deemed  a  request  for  a  Base  RateBorrowing.

Section 3.04(e) , other than as set forth below); or 46

(ii)impose  on any Lender or the relevant interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement orEurocurrency Rate Loans or SONIA Loans made by such Lender;

 to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.This 
Section 3.04  shall not apply to Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by Section 3.01 . (b)
Capital  and Liquidity Requirements.  If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or anyLending
 Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effectof
 reducing  the  rate  of  return  on  such  Lender’s  capital  or  on  the  capital  of  such  Lender’s  holding  company,  if  any,  as  a  consequence  of  thisAgreement, the
 Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holdingcompany
 could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’sholding
 company  with  respect  to  capital  adequacy  and  liquidity),  then  from  time  to  time  the  Company  will  pay  (or  cause  the  applicableDesignated

 of the applicable Lender under agreements having provisions similar to this Section  3.04 after  consideration of such factors as suchLender
 then  reasonably  determines  to  be  relevant  (which  determination  shall  be  made  in  good  faith).  The  Company  shall  pay  (or  cause  theapplicable Designated Borrower to pay) such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof.
(d)
Delay in Requests . Failure or delay  on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of thisSection
 shall  not  constitute  a  waiver  of  such  Lender’s  right  to  demand  such  compensation, provided  that  no  Borrower  shall  be  required  tocompensate
 a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 120days
 prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of suchLender’s
 intention  to  claim  compensation  therefor  (except  that,  if  the  Change  in  Law  giving  rise  to  such  increased  costs  or  reductions  isretroactive, then the 120-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

 charging such costs to similarly situated customers of the applicable Lender under agreements having provisions similar to this Section 3.04
 after consideration of such factors as such Lender then47

reasonably determines to be relevant (which determination shall be made in good faith). The Company shall pay such Lender the amount shownas
 due on any such certificate on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan. If a Lender fails to give notice 30 days prior to the relevantInterest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and payable 30 days from receipt of such notice.

any  continuation,  conversion,  payment  or  prepayment  of  any  Eurocurrency  Rate  Loan  on  a  day  other  than  the  last  day  of  theInterest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

 Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the LIBO Rate, the EURIBO Rate or the TIBO Rate forsuch Loan, as applicable, and each SONIA Loan made by it at the Daily Simple SONIA, in each case, by a matching deposit or other borrowing in
the relevant interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan or SONIA Loan

Section 3.01 , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; (d)
such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and (e)
