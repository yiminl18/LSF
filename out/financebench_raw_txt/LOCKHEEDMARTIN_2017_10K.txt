ITEM  1.    Business
General
We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of
advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system
integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial
applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2017, 69% of our $51.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S.
Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 58% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 30% were from international
customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our
main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.
We operate in an environment characterized by both increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally.
A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our
products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our
customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent
markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue
to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to
succeed.
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space, previously known
as Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.
Aeronautics
In 2017, our Aeronautics business segment generated net sales of $20.1 billion, which represented 39% of our total consolidated net sales. Aeronautics’
customers include the military services and various other government agencies of the U.S. and other countries. In 2017, U.S. Government customers
accounted for 63%, international customers accounted for 36% and U.S. commercial and other customers accounted for 1% of Aeronautics’ net sales. Net
sales from Aeronautics’ combat aircraft products and services represented 30% of our total consolidated net sales in 2017 and 28% in both 2016 and 2015.
Aeronautics is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft,
including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include:
•F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter - international multi-role, multi-variant, fifth generation stealth fighter;
•C-130 Hercules - international tactical airlifter;
•F-16 Fighting Falcon - low-cost, combat-proven, international multi-role fighter;
•F-22 Raptor - air dominance and multi-mission fifth generation stealth fighter; and
•C-5M Super Galaxy - strategic airlifter.
The F-35 program is our largest program, generating 25% of our total consolidated net sales, as well as 64% of Aeronautics’ net sales in 2017. The F-35
program consists of development contracts, multiple production contracts, and sustainment activities. The development contracts are being performed
concurrently with the production contracts. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts is used for complex programs to test aircraft,
shorten the time to field systems and achieve overall cost savings. The System Development and Demonstration (SDD) portion of the development contracts
was substantially completed in 2017, with over 99% of flight test objectives met through over 9,200 flights. Approximately 70 flights remain and are
expected to be completed in early 2018. Additionally, the final logistics and training capability is planned for 2018 and new Third Life structural testing
added to the SDD portion in 2013 is scheduled to be completed in 2019. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S.
Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy; commitments from our eight international partners and
three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. During 2017, we delivered 66 aircraft to our U.S. and international
partners, resulting in total deliveries of 266 production aircraft as of December 31, 2017. We have 235 production aircraft in backlog as of December 31,

2017, including orders from our international partners. For additional information on the F-35 program, see “Status of the F‑35 Program” in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Aeronautics produces and provides support and sustainment services for the C-130J Super Hercules, as well as upgrades and support services for the
legacy C-130 Hercules worldwide fleet. We delivered 26 C-130J aircraft in 2017, including seven to international customers. We have 64 aircraft in our
backlog as of December 31, 2017 with advanced funding from customers for additional C-130J aircraft not currently in backlog. Our C-130J backlog extends
into 2020.
While production and deliveries of F-16 aircraft were completed in 2017 from our Fort Worth, Texas facilities, Aeronautics continues to provide service-
life extension, modernization and other upgrade programs for our customers’ F‑16 aircraft, with existing contracts continuing for several years. We delivered
eight F-16 aircraft in 2017 and continue to seek international opportunities to deliver additional aircraft. In November 2017, the U.S. and Bahrain signed a
government-to-government agreement, or a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA), regarding the sale of new production Block 70 aircraft for the Royal
Bahraini Air Force. We are transitioning F-16 production to Greenville, South Carolina, to support the Bahrain production program and other emerging F-16
production requirements.
While production and deliveries of F-22 aircraft were completed in 2012, Aeronautics continues to provide modernization and sustainment activities for
the U.S. Air Force’s F-22 aircraft fleet. The modernization program comprises upgrading existing systems requirements, developing new systems
requirements, adding capabilities and enhancing the performance of the weapon systems. The sustainment program consists of sustaining the weapon systems
of the F-22 fleet, providing training systems, customer support, integrated support planning, supply chain management, aircraft modifications and heavy
maintenance, systems engineering and support products.
Aeronautics provides sustainment services for the existing U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy fleet and modernization activities to convert 52 C-5 Galaxy aircraft
to the C-5M Super Galaxy configuration. These modernization activities include the installation of new engines, landing gear and systems and other
improvements that enable a shorter takeoff, a higher climb rate, an increased cargo load and longer flight range. As of December 31, 2017, we had delivered
48 C‑5M aircraft under these modernization activities, including seven C-5M aircraft delivered in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we have four C-5 aircraft
in backlog with all deliveries expected in 2018. Although existing production contracts provide for deliveries of C-5M aircraft through mid-2018, we continue
to seek additional modernization opportunities for the C-5 Galaxy fleet beyond 2018. Sustainment activities for our customers’ C-5 Galaxy aircraft are
expected to continue for several years.
In addition to the aircraft programs discussed above, Aeronautics is involved in advanced development programs incorporating innovative design and
rapid prototype applications. Our Advanced Development Programs (ADP) organization, also known as Skunk Works®, is focused on future systems,
including unmanned and manned aerial systems and next generation capabilities for advanced strike, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, situational
awareness and air mobility. We continue to explore technology advancement and insertion in our existing aircraft. We also are involved in numerous network-
enabled activities that allow separate systems to work together to increase effectiveness and we continue to invest in new technologies to maintain and
enhance competitiveness in military aircraft design, development and production.
Missiles and Fire Control
In 2017, our MFC business segment generated net sales of $7.2 billion, which represented 14% of our total consolidated net sales. MFC’s customers
include the military services, principally the U.S. Army, and various government agencies of the U.S. and other countries, as well as commercial and other
customers. In 2017, U.S. Government customers accounted for 64%, international customers accounted for 34% and U.S. commercial and other customers
accounted for 2% of MFC’s net sales.
MFC provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems;

Financial, Geographic and Other Business Segment Information
For additional information regarding our business segments, including comparative segment net sales, operating profit and related financial information,
including geographic, for 2017, 2016, and 2015, see “Business Segment Results of Operations” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 5 – Information on Business Segments” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Competition
Our broad portfolio of products and services competes both domestically and internationally against products and services of other large aerospace and
defense companies, as well as numerous smaller competitors. Changes within the industry we operate in, such as vertical integration by our peers, could
negatively impact us. We often form teams with our competitors in efforts to provide our customers with the best mix of capabilities to address specific
requirements. In some areas of our business, customer requirements are changing to encourage expanded competition and increasingly what would have
previously been competed as a single large procurement is being broken into multiple smaller procurements. Principal factors of competition include the
value of our products and services to the customer; technical and management capability; the ability to develop and implement complex, integrated system
architectures; total cost of ownership; our demonstrated ability to execute and perform against contract requirements; and our ability to provide timely
solutions. Technological advances in such areas as: additive manufacturing, cloud computing, advanced materials, autonomy, robotics, and big data and new
business models such as commercial access to space are enabling new factors of competition for both traditional and non-traditional competitors.
The competition for international sales is generally subject to U.S. Government stipulations (e.g., export restrictions, market access, technology transfer,
industrial cooperation and contracting practices). We may compete against U.S. and non-U.S. companies (or teams) for contract awards by international
governments. International competitions also may be subject to different laws or contracting practices of international governments that may affect how we
structure our bid for the procurement. In many international procurements, the purchasing government’s relationship with the U.S. and its industrial
cooperation programs are also important factors in determining the outcome of a competition. It is common for international customers to require contractors
to comply with their industrial cooperation regulations, sometimes referred to as offset requirements, and we have entered into foreign offset agreements as
part of securing some international business. For more information concerning offset agreements, see “Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Intellectual Property
We routinely apply for and own a substantial number of U.S. and foreign patents related to the products and services we provide. In addition to owning a
large portfolio of patents, we own other intellectual property, including trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how. Unpatented research,
development and engineering skills also make an important contribution to our business. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. The
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provides that the U.S. Government has licenses in our intellectual property, including patents, that are developed in
performance of government contracts or with government funding, and it may use or authorize others, including competitors, to use such intellectual property,
commonly referred to as government use rights. The U.S. Government is taking increasingly aggressive positions under the FAR both as to what intellectual
property they believe such rights apply and to acquire broad license rights to use and have others use such intellectual property. If the U.S. Government is
successful in these efforts, this could affect our ability to compete and to obtain access to and use certain supplier intellectual property. Foreign governments
may also have certain rights in patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of foreign government contracts. Although our intellectual
property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business, we do not believe that any existing patent, license or other intellectual property
right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on our business taken as a whole.
Raw Materials and Seasonality
Some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials. Historically, we have been successful in obtaining the raw materials and other supplies
needed in our manufacturing processes. We seek to manage raw materials supply risk through long-term contracts and by maintaining an acceptable level of
the key materials in inventories.
Aluminum and titanium are important raw materials used in certain of our Aeronautics and Space programs. Long-term agreements have helped enable a
continued supply of aluminum and titanium. Carbon fiber is an important ingredient in composite materials used in our Aeronautics programs, such as the F-
35 aircraft. We have been advised by some suppliers that pricing and the timing of availability of materials in some commodities markets can fluctuate
widely. These fluctuations may negatively affect the price and availability of certain materials. While we do not anticipate material problems regarding the
supply of our raw
6
Table of Contents
materials and believe that we have taken appropriate measures to mitigate these variations, if key materials become unavailable or if pricing fluctuates widely
in the future, it could result in delay of one or more of our programs, increased costs or reduced operating profits.
No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our sales between accounting periods,
including the timing of government awards, the availability of government funding, product deliveries and customer acceptance.
Government Contracts and Regulations
Our business is heavily regulated. We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, principally all branches of the U.S. military and
NASA. We also contract with similar government authorities in other countries and they regulate our international efforts. Additionally, our commercial
aircraft products are required to comply with U.S. and international regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation
approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety.
We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government and other
governments’ contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things:
•require certification and disclosure of all cost or pricing data in connection with certain types of contract negotiations;
•impose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from U.S. GAAP;
•impose acquisition regulations, which may change or be replaced over time, that define allowable and unallowable costs, the allocability of costs, and
otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain U.S. Government and foreign contracts;
•require specific security controls to protect U.S. Government controlled unclassified information and restrict the use and dissemination of information
classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services and technical data; and
•require the review and approval of contractor business systems, defined in the regulations as: (i) Accounting System; (ii) Estimating System; (iii) Earned
Value Management System, for managing cost and schedule performance on certain complex programs; (iv) Purchasing System; (v) Material
Management and Accounting System, for planning, controlling and accounting for the acquisition, use, issuing and disposition of material; and (vi)
Property Management System.
The U.S. Government and other governments may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts either at its convenience or for default
based on our performance. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we generally are protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on
the contract and profit on those costs. If a contract is terminated for default, we generally are entitled to payments for our work that has been accepted by the
U.S. Government or other governments; however, the U.S. Government and other governments could make claims to reduce the contract value or recover its
procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. For more information regarding the U.S. Government’s and other governments’ right to terminate
our contracts, see Item 1A - Risk Factors. For more information regarding government contracting laws and regulations, see Item 1A - Risk Factors as well as
“Critical Accounting Policies - Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations. For more information on the risks of doing work internationally, see Item 1A - Risk Factors. Additionally, the U.S. Government may also enter
into unilateral contract actions. This can affect our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms.
A portion of our business is classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified contracts are
included in our consolidated financial statements. The business risks and capital requirements associated with classified contracts historically have not
differed materially from those of our other U.S. Government contracts. Our internal controls addressing the financial reporting of classified contracts are
consistent with our internal controls for our non-classified contracts.
Our operations are subject to and affected by various federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations regarding the
discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise regulating the protection of the environment. While the extent of our financial exposure cannot in all
cases be reasonably estimated, the costs of environmental compliance have not had, and we do not expect that these costs will have, a material adverse effect
on our earnings, financial position and cash flow, primarily because most of our environmental costs are allowable in establishing the price of our products
and services under our contracts with the U.S. Government. For information regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that we
believe are required for remediation or cleanup to the extent that they are probable and estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies - Environmental Matters”
in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and
Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also the discussion of environmental matters within Item 1A - Risk Factors.

Backlog
At December 31, 2017, our backlog was $99.9 billion compared with $96.2 billion at December 31, 2016. Backlog is converted into sales in future
periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. Under existing revenue recognition guidance, approximately $31 billion, or 31%, of our backlog at
December 31, 2017 would have been converted into sales in 2018.
Our backlog includes both funded (firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the
customer) and unfunded (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated) amounts. We do not include unexercised options or potential orders under
indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity agreements in our backlog. If any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be
reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts. Funded backlog was $73.6 billion at December 31, 2017, as compared to $66.0 billion
at December 31, 2016. For backlog related to each of our business segments, see “Business Segment Results of Operations” in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Research and Development
We conduct research and development (R&D) activities under customer-sponsored contracts and with our own independent R&D funds. Our independent
R&D costs include basic research, applied research, development, systems and other concept formulation studies. Generally, these costs are allocated among
contracts and programs in progress. Costs we incur under customer-sponsored R&D programs pursuant to contracts are included in net sales and cost of sales.
Under certain arrangements in which a customer shares in product development costs, our portion of the unreimbursed costs is expensed as incurred in cost of
sales. Independent R&D costs charged to cost of sales were $1.2 billion in 2017, $988 million in 2016, and $817 million in 2015. See “Note 1 – Significant
Accounting Policies” (under the caption “Research and development and similar costs”) included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 100,000 employees, about 93% of whom were located in the U.S. Approximately 21% of our employees
are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. A number of our existing collective bargaining agreements expire in any given year.
Historically, we have been successful in negotiating renewals to expiring agreements without any material disruption of operating activities. Management
considers employee relations to be good.

of assets, or the anticipated consequences are examples of forward-looking statements. Numerous factors, including the risk factors described in the following
section, could affect our forward-looking statements and actual performance.
Our actual financial results likely will be different from those projected due to the inherent nature of projections. Given these uncertainties, forward-
looking statements should not be relied on in making investment decisions. The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K speak only as of the
date of its filing. Except where required by applicable law, we expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements after the date of this
Form 10-K to reflect subsequent events, changed circumstances, changes in expectations, or the estimates and assumptions associated with them. The
forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by the federal securities laws.
ITEM  1A.    Risk Factors
An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business,
but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material effect on our
operating results, financial position, or cash flows. You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase our common stock or debt securities.
We depend heavily on contracts with the U.S. Government for a substantial portion of our business.
We derived 69% of our total net sales from the U.S. Government in 2017, including 58% from the Department of Defense (DoD). We expect to continue
to derive most of our sales from work performed under U.S. Government contracts. Those contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of
Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may extend over many years.
Consequently, contracts are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur
costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the
contract.
The F-35 is our largest program and represented 25% of our total net sales in 2017 and is expected to represent a higher percentage of our sales in future
years. A decision to cut spending or reduce planned orders would have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Given the size and complexity of the F-
35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD,
Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, increasing
manufacturing capabilities to meet higher customer demand for new aircraft and sustainment activities, supplier and partner performance, software
development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, successfully negotiating and receiving funding for production
contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft. Additionally, the U.S. Government may
also enter into unilateral contract actions. A unilateral contract action obligates us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. Government.
Unilateral contract actions could negatively affect profit and cash flows, and establish a precedent for future contracts.
Based upon our diverse range of defense, homeland security and information technology products and services, we believe that this makes it less likely
that cuts in any specific contract or program will have a long-term effect on our business. However, termination of multiple or large programs or contracts
could adversely affect our business and future financial performance. Potential changes in funding priorities may afford new or additional opportunities for
our businesses in terms of existing, follow-on or replacement programs. While we would expect to compete and be well positioned as the incumbent on
existing programs, we may not be successful or the replacement programs may be funded at lower levels.
We are subject to a number of procurement laws and regulations. Our business and our reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to comply
with these laws.
We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts.
Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. A violation of
specific laws and regulations, by us, our employees, others working on our behalf, a supplier or a venture partner, could harm our reputation and result in the
imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contracts, loss of our ability to
export products or services and civil or criminal investigations or proceedings.
In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are different from those typically found in commercial transactions. For
example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts either at its convenience or for default based on our
performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally
9
Table of Contents
are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process and an allowance for profit on the
contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss.
Upon termination for convenience of a cost-reimbursable contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee.
Allowable costs would include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to
the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation. We attempt to ensure that adequate funds are available by
notifying the customer when its estimated costs, including those associated with a possible termination for convenience, approach levels specified as being
allotted to its programs. As funds are typically appropriated on a fiscal year basis and as the costs of a termination for convenience may exceed the costs of
continuing a program in a given fiscal year, occasionally programs do not have sufficient funds appropriated to cover the termination costs were the
government to terminate them for convenience. Under such circumstances, the U.S. Government could assert that it is not required to appropriate additional
funding.
A termination arising out of our default may expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and
orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime
contract under which we are a subcontractor, notwithstanding the quality of our services as a subcontractor. In the case of termination for default, the U.S.
Government could make claims to reduce the contract value or recover its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. However, under such
circumstances we have rights and remedial actions under laws and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
In addition, certain of our U.S. Government contracts span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the
right not to exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period for various reasons. However, the U.S. Government may exercise option periods,
even for contracts for which it is expected that our costs may exceed the contract price or ceiling.
U.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and various agency Inspectors
General, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, its cost structure, its
business systems and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. Government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain
payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. Additionally, any costs found to be misclassified may be subject to repayment. We
have unaudited and/or unsettled incurred cost claims related to past years, which places risk on our ability to issue final billings on contracts for which
authorized and appropriated funds may be expiring.
If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including
reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, penalties, fines and suspension, or
prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made
against us. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business.
Our profitability and cash flow may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs, our performance, our ability to control costs and evolving
U.S. Government procurement policies.
Our profitability and cash flow may vary materially depending on the types of government contracts undertaken, the nature of products produced or
services performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of
performance at which the right to receive fees is determined, particularly under award and incentive-fee contracts.
Our backlog includes a variety of contract types that are intended to address changing risk and reward profiles as a program matures. Contract types
include cost-reimbursable, fixed-price incentive-fee, fixed-price and time-and-materials contracts. Contracts for development programs with complex design
and technical challenges are typically cost-reimbursable. Under cost-reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may
be fixed or performance-based. In these cases, the associated financial risks primarily relate to a reduction in fees and the program could be canceled if cost,
schedule or technical performance issues arise.
Other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production (e.g., Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contracts), which includes the
challenge of starting and stabilizing a manufacturing production and test line while the final design is being validated. These generally are cost-reimbursable
or fixed-price incentive-fee contracts. Under a fixed-price incentive-fee contract, the allowable costs incurred are eligible for reimbursement but are subject to
a cost-share arrangement, which affects profitability. Generally, if our costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable
regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated.
10
Table of Contents
There are also contracts for production, as well as operations and maintenance of the delivered products, that have the challenge of achieving a stable
production and delivery rate, while maintaining operability of the product after delivery. These contracts are mainly fixed-price, although some operations and
maintenance contracts are time-and-materials type. Under fixed-price contracts, we receive a fixed price regardless of the actual costs we incur. We have to
absorb any costs in excess of the fixed price. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain
expenses.
The failure to perform to customer expectations and contract requirements may result in reduced fees or losses and affect our financial performance in
that period. Under each type of contract, if we are unable to control costs, our operating results could be adversely affected, particularly if we are unable to
justify an increase in contract value to our customers. Cost overruns or the failure to perform on existing programs also may adversely affect our ability to
retain existing programs and win future contract awards.
The U.S. Government is currently pursuing and implementing policies that could negatively impact our profitability. Changes in procurement policy
favoring more incentive-based fee arrangements, different award fee criteria or government contract negotiation offers based upon the customer’s view of
what our costs should be (as compared to our actual costs) may affect the predictability of our profit rates. Our customers are subject to pressures that may
result in a change in contract types referenced above earlier in a program’s maturity than is traditional. An example of this is the use of fixed-price incentive-
fee contracts for recent LRIP contracts on the F-35 program while the development contract is being performed concurrently. Our customers also may pursue
non-traditional contract provisions in negotiation of contracts. For example, changes resulting from the F-35 development contract may need to be
implemented on the production contracts (including the LRIP contracts), a concept referred to as concurrency, which may require us to pay for a portion of
the concurrency costs. In some circumstances, the U.S. Government is proposing positions that are inconsistent with the FAR and existing practice. For
example, the U.S. Government is now requiring that bid and proposal costs be included in general and administrative costs, rather than charged directly to
contracts in certain circumstances. Another example is a recent challenge to overhead costs. The U.S. Government’s pursuit of policies intended to cause us to
absorb cost may become more aggressive if the U.S. Government concludes that our profitability justifies cost shifting without regard to the provisions of the
FAR.
Other policies could negatively impact our working capital and cash flow. For example contrary to FAR, the government has expressed a preference for
requiring progress payments rather than performance based payments on new fixed-price contracts, which if implemented, delays our ability to recover a
significant amount of costs incurred on a contract and thus affects the timing of our cash flows.
Increased competition and bid protests in a budget-constrained environment may make it more difficult to maintain our financial performance and
customer relationships.
We are experiencing increased competition while, at the same time, many of our customers are facing budget pressures, trying to do more with less by
cutting costs, identifying more affordable solutions, performing certain work internally rather than hiring a contractor, and reducing product development
cycles. It is critical we maintain strong customer relationships and seek to understand the priorities of their requirements in this price competitive
environment.
In international sales, we face substantial competition from both U.S. manufacturers and international manufacturers whose governments sometimes
provide research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products. Additionally, our competitors are also focusing on
increasing their international sales to partially mitigate the effect of reduced U.S. Government budgets. To remain competitive, we consistently must maintain
strong customer relationships and provide superior performance, advanced technology solutions and service at an affordable cost and with the agility that our
customers require to satisfy their mission objectives.
A substantial portion of our business is awarded through competitive bidding. The U.S. Government increasingly has relied upon competitive contract
award types, including indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity and other multi-award contracts, which have the potential to create pricing pressure and
increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bids and proposals. In addition, multi-award contracts require that we make sustained efforts to obtain
task orders under the contract. The competitive bidding process entails substantial costs and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that
may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors. Additionally, the U.S. Government may fail to award us large competitive contracts in an effort
to maintain a broader industrial base. Following award, we may encounter significant expenses, delays, contract modifications or bid protests from
unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Unsuccessful bidders are more frequently protesting in the hope of being awarded a subcontract for a portion of
the work in return for withdrawing the protest. Bid protests could result in significant expenses to us, contract modifications or even loss of the contract
award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of a contract award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and, as a
result, delay our recognizing sales. We also may not be successful in our efforts to protest or challenge any bids for contracts that were not awarded to us and
we could incur significant time and expense in such efforts.

We are the prime contractor on most of our contracts and if our subcontractors, suppliers or teaming agreement or venture partners fail to perform
their obligations, our performance and our ability to win future business could be harmed.
For most of our contracts we rely on other companies to provide materials, major components and products, and to perform a portion of the services that
we provide to our customers. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, ventures or supply agreements with other companies upon
which we rely (contracting parties). There is a risk that the contracting party does not perform and we may have disputes with our contracting parties,
including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed, the workshare provided to that party, customer concerns about the other party’s
performance, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders, or our hiring the personnel of a subcontractor, teammate or venture partner or
vice versa. In addition, changes in the economic environment, including defense budgets and constraints on available financing, may adversely affect the
financial stability of our contracting parties and their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a timely basis as might
their inability to perform profitably in the current highly competitive and budget constrained environment. We could also be adversely affected by
reputational issues experienced by our teammates that are outside of our control, which could adversely affect our ability to compete for contract awards. A
failure, for whatever reason, by one or more of our contracting parties to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services on a timely
basis, according to specifications, or at all may affect our ability to perform our obligations and require that we transition the work to other companies.
Contracting party performance deficiencies may result in additional costs or delays in product deliveries and affect our operating results and could result in a
customer terminating our contract for default or convenience. A default termination could expose us to liability and affect our ability to compete for future
contracts and orders. Additionally, our efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the affordability of our products and services could
negatively impact our ability to attract and retain suppliers.
International sales may pose different risks.
In 2017, 30% of our total net sales were from international customers. This percentage has been increasing and we have a strategy to continue to grow
international sales, inclusive of sales of F-35 aircraft to our international partners and other countries. International sales are subject to numerous political and
economic factors, regulatory requirements, significant competition, taxation, and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. Our exposure
to such risks increased as a result of our acquisition of Sikorsky and our increased ownership interest in AWE and may further increase if our international
sales grow as we anticipate.
Our international business is conducted through foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government or by direct commercial sales
(DCS) with international customers. In 2017, approximately 63% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 37% were DCS. These
transaction types differ as FMS transactions represent sales by the U.S. Government to international governments and our contract with the U.S. Government
is subject to FAR. By contrast, DCS transactions represent sales directly to another international government or commercial customer. All sales to
international customers are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, import-export control, technology transfer
restrictions, taxation, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, and the
anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. While we have stringent policies in place to comply with such laws and regulations, failure by
us, our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities,
including suspension, debarment from bidding for or performing government contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material
adverse effect on us. We frequently team with international subcontractors and suppliers who are also exposed to similar risks.
While international sales, whether contracted as FMS or DCS, present risks that are different and potentially greater than those encountered in our U.S.
business, DCS with international customers may impose even greater risks. DCS transactions involve commercial relationships with parties with whom we
have less familiarity and where there may be significant cultural differences. Additionally, international procurement rules and regulations, contract laws and
regulations, and contractual terms differ from those in the U.S. and are less familiar to us. International regulations may be interpreted by foreign courts less
bound by precedent and with more discretion; these interpretations frequently have terms less favorable to us than the FAR. Export and import, tax and
currency risk also may be increased for DCS with international customers. While these risks are potentially greater than those encountered in our U.S.
business, we seek to price our products and services commensurate with the risk profile on DCS with international customers.
Our international business is highly sensitive to changes in regulations, political environments or security risks that may affect our ability to conduct
business outside of the U.S., including those regarding investment, procurement, taxation and repatriation of earnings. Our international business also may be
impacted by changes in foreign national priorities, foreign government budgets, global economic conditions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. Sales of military products are also affected by defense budgets and U.S. foreign policy. Additionally, the timing of orders from our international
customers can be less predictable than for our U.S. customers and may lead to fluctuations in the amount reported each year for our international sales.

In conjunction with defense procurements, some international customers require contractors to comply with industrial cooperation regulations, including
entering into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements. Offset agreements may require in-country purchases, technology
transfers, local manufacturing support, investments in foreign joint ventures and financial support projects as an incentive or as a condition to a contract
award. In some countries, these offset agreements may require the establishment of a venture with a local company, which must control the venture. The costs
to satisfy our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our profitability and cash flows. The
ability to recover investments that we make is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products
and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. In these and other situations, we could be liable for violations of law for actions taken by these
entities such as laws related to anti-corruption, import and export, taxation, and anti-boycott restrictions. Offset agreements generally extend over several
years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are typically subjective and can be
outside our control.
Our efforts to minimize the likelihood and impact of adverse cyber security incidents and to protect data and intellectual property may not be
successful and our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.
We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our
company sensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and venture partners. We have a Computer
Incident Response Team (CIRT) which has among its responsibilities defending against such attacks. Additionally, we conduct regular periodic training of our
employees as to the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks. We experience similar
security threats at customer sites that we operate and manage.
The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states,
which target us and other defense contractors because we protect national security information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our
customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, and depending on the
severity of the incident, our customers’ data, our employees’ data, our intellectual property, and other third party data (such as teammates, venture partners,
subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. As a consequence of their persistence, sophistication and volume, we may not be successful in
defending against all such attacks. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats and the national security aspects of much of the data we protect, the
impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.
In addition to cyber threats, we experience threats to the security of our facilities and employees and threats from terrorist acts as do our customers,
suppliers, subcontractors, venture partners and entities we acquire with whom we typically work cooperatively to seek to minimize the impact of cyber
threats, other security threats or business disruptions. However, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, as well as other entities, which
we do not control, who have access to our information, and may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cybersecurity
expertise and safeguards, and their relationships with government contractors, such as Lockheed Martin, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by
the same cyber threats we face. We have approximately 16,000 direct suppliers and even more indirect suppliers with a wide variety of systems and cyber
security capabilities and we may not be successful in preventing adversaries from exploiting possible weak links in our supply chain. We also must rely on
this supply chain for detecting and reporting cyber incidents and so we may not be successful in reporting or responding to cyber security incidents in a timely
manner.
The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Additionally, some cyber
technologies we develop under contract for our customers, particularly those related to homeland security, may raise potential liabilities related to intellectual
property and civil liberties, including privacy concerns, which may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means or involve reputational risk. Our
enterprise risk management program includes threat detection and cyber security mitigation plans, and our disclosure controls and procedures address cyber
security and include elements intended to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from security breaches. We also maintain
compliance programs to address the potential applicability of restrictions against trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information generally and
in connection with a cyber security breach. However, we may not be successful in detecting, reporting or responding to cyber incidents in a timely manner.
If we fail to manage acquisitions, divestitures, equity investments and other transactions successfully or if acquired entities or equity investments fail
to perform as expected, our financial results, business and future prospects could be harmed.
In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate companies, and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions,
divestitures, ventures and equity investments. We seek to identify acquisition or investment opportunities that will expand or complement our existing
products and services or customer base, at attractive valuations. We often compete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we must conduct
due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential
13
Table of Contents
loss contingencies; negotiate transaction terms; complete and close complex transactions; integrate acquired companies and employees; and realize
anticipated operating synergies efficiently and effectively. Acquisition, divestiture, venture and investment transactions often require substantial management
resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. Unidentified or identified but un-indemnified pre-closing liabilities could
affect our future financial results, particularly successor liability under procurement laws and regulations such as the False Claims Act or Truth in
Negotiations Act, anti-corruption, tax, import-export and technology transfer laws which provide for civil and criminal penalties and the potential for
debarment. We also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating
duplicate facilities, employee retention, transaction-related or other litigation, and other liabilities. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business
and results of operations. 
Ventures, or noncontrolling equity investments, operate under shared control with other parties. Under the equity method of accounting for
nonconsolidated ventures and investments, we recognize our share of the operating profit of these ventures in our results of operations. Our operating results
may be affected by the performance of businesses over which we do not exercise control, which includes the inability to influence strategic decisions that may
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, we may not be successful in achieving the growth or other intended
benefits of strategic investments. Our joint ventures face many of the same risks and uncertainties as we do. The most significant impact of our equity
investments is in our Space business segment where approximately 21% of its 2017 operating profit was derived from its share of earnings from equity
method investees, particularly that in United Launch Alliance (ULA).
There can be no assurance that we will continue to increase our dividend or to repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels.
The payment of cash dividends and share repurchases is subject to limitations under applicable laws and the discretion of our Board of Directors and is
determined after considering current conditions, including earnings, other operating results and capital requirements. Our payment of dividends and share
repurchases could vary from historical practices or our stated expectations. Decreases in asset values or increases in liabilities, including liabilities associated
with benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes, can reduce net earnings and stockholders’ equity. We recorded a net one-time tax charge,
substantially all of which was non-cash, resulting from the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced our 2017 net earnings and resulted
in a deficit in our total equity as of December 31, 2017. As a Maryland corporation, so long as we are able to pay our indebtedness as it becomes due in the
usual course of business, we anticipate that we would be able to pay dividends and make stock repurchases in an amount limited to our net earnings in either
the current or the preceding fiscal year or from the net earnings for the preceding eight quarters, notwithstanding the deficit in our total equity. However, our
ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases under Maryland law could be limited if our net earnings are less than anticipated. We also have no
assurance as to the timing of any increase in our stockholders’ equity. In addition, the timing and amount of share repurchases under board approved share
repurchase plans is within the discretion of management and will depend on many factors, including results of operations, capital requirements as well as
applicable law.
Our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance.
A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced defense and technology products and systems. New
technologies may be untested or unproven. Failure of some of these products and services could result in extensive loss of life or property damage.
Accordingly, we also may incur liabilities that are unique to our products and services, including combat and air mobility aircraft, missile and space systems,
command and control systems, cybersecurity, homeland security and training programs. In some but not all circumstances, we may be entitled to certain legal
protections or indemnifications from our customers, either through U.S. Government indemnifications under Public Law 85-804 or the Price-Anderson Act,
qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002,
contractual provisions or otherwise. We endeavor to obtain insurance coverage from established insurance carriers to cover these risks and liabilities. The
amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Existing coverage may be canceled while we remain
exposed to the risk, and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. For example, we are limited in the amount
of insurance we can obtain to cover certain natural hazards, such as earthquakes. We have significant operations in geographic areas prone to this risk, such as
Sunnyvale, California. Even if insurance coverage is available, we may not be able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us. Additionally, disputes
with insurance carriers over coverage terms or the insolvency of one or more of our insurance carriers may significantly affect the amount or timing of our
cash flows.
Substantial costs resulting from an accident; failure of or defect in our products or services; natural catastrophe or other incident; or liability arising from
our products and services in excess of any legal protection, indemnity, and our insurance coverage (or for which indemnity or insurance is not available or not
obtained) could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows, or operating results. Any accident, failure of, or defect in our products or services, even
if fully indemnified or insured, could
14
Table of Contents
negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. It also could affect the cost and
availability of adequate insurance in the future.
Pension funding and costs are dependent on several economic assumptions which if changed may cause our future earnings and cash flow to
fluctuate significantly as well as affect the affordability of our products and services.
Many of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans, and other postemployment plans
(collectively, postretirement benefit plans). The impact of these plans on our U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings may be volatile
in that the amount of expense we record for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to
changes in several key economic assumptions including interest rates and rates of return on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions including participant
longevity (also known as mortality) and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. Changes in these factors, including actual returns on plan
assets, may also affect our plan funding, cash flow and stockholders’ equity. In addition, the funding of our plans and recovery of costs on our contracts, as
described below, may also be subject to changes caused by legislative or regulatory actions.
With regard to cash flow, we make substantial cash contributions to our plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). We generally are able to recover these contributions related to our plans as allowable
costs on our U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, but there is a lag between when we contribute cash to our plans under pension funding rules and
recover it under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). Effective February 2012, the CAS rules were revised to harmonize the measurement
and period assignment of the pension cost allocable to government contracts with the PPA (CAS Harmonization). Following the five year transition period,
CAS Harmonization was fully phased in during 2017, this better aligns the CAS pension cost and ERISA funding requirements. The enactment of the
Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased the interest rate assumption used to determine our CAS
pension costs and ERISA funding requirements. This has the effect of lowering both the recovery of pension contributions, as it decreases our CAS pension
costs, and our ERISA funding requirements during the affected periods.
For more information on how these factors could impact earnings, financial position, cash flow and stockholders’ equity, see “Critical Accounting
Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and “Note 11 –
Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Environmental costs could affect our future earnings as well as the affordability of our products and services.
Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations. We are involved
in environmental remediation at some of our facilities, some of our former facilities, and at third-party-owned sites where we have been designated a
potentially responsible party. In addition, we could be affected by future regulations imposed or claims asserted in response to concerns over climate change,
other aspects of the environment or natural resources. We have an ongoing, comprehensive sustainability program to reduce the effects of our operations on
the environment.
We manage and have managed various U.S. Government-owned facilities, and portions of U.S. Government-owned facilities, on behalf of the U.S.
Government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs historically have been the responsibility of the U.S. Government. We have
relied, and continue to rely with respect to past practices, upon U.S. Government funding to pay such costs, notwithstanding efforts by some U.S.
Government representatives to limit this responsibility. Although the U.S. Government remains responsible for capital and operating costs associated with
environmental compliance, responsibility for fines and penalties associated with environmental noncompliance typically is borne by either the U.S.
Government or the contractor, depending on the contract and the relevant facts. Some environmental laws include criminal provisions. An environmental law
conviction could affect our ability to be awarded future, or perform existing, U.S. Government contracts.
We have incurred and will continue to incur liabilities under various federal, state, local and foreign statutes for environmental protection and
remediation. The extent of our financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated at this time. Among the variables management must assess in
evaluating costs associated with these cases and remediation sites generally are the status of site assessment, extent of the contamination, impacts on natural
resources, changing cost estimates, evolution of technologies used to remediate the site, continually evolving environmental standards and cost allowability
issues, including varying efforts by the U.S. Government to limit allowability of our costs in resolving liability at third party-owned sites. For information
regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for remediation or cleanup to the extent probable and
estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies - Environmental Matters” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty.
Our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. As required
by GAAP, we estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably
estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our
assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements. For a description of our
current legal proceedings, see Item 3 - Legal Proceedings along with “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings,
Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce.
Many of the products and services we provide are highly engineered and involve sophisticated technologies, with related complex manufacturing and
system integration processes. Our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends, in part, on our ability
to adapt to changing customer needs rapidly, identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture innovative products and services and bring
those offerings to market quickly at cost-effective prices. Due to the complex nature of the products and services we offer, we may experience technical
difficulties during the development of new products or technologies. These technical difficulties could result in delays and higher costs, which may negatively
impact our financial results, until such products or technologies are fully developed. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our developmental projects
will be successful or meet the needs of our customer.
Additionally, the possibility exists that our competitors may develop new technology or offerings that could cause our existing offerings to become
obsolete. If we fail in our development projects or if our new products or technologies fail to achieve customer acceptance, our ability to procure new
contracts could be unsuccessful and this could negatively impact our financial results.
Due to the specialized nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain a workforce with the requisite
skills in multiple areas including: engineering, science, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, business development and strategy and
management. Our operating performance is also dependent upon personnel who hold security clearances and receive substantial training in order to work on
certain programs or tasks. Additionally, as we expand our operations internationally, it is increasingly important to hire and retain personnel with relevant
experience in local laws, regulations, customs, traditions and business practices.
We face a number of challenges that may affect personnel retention such as our endeavors to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the
affordability of our products and services such as workforce reductions and consolidating and relocating certain operations. Additionally a substantial portion
of our workforce are retirement-eligible or nearing retirement. We previously amended certain of our defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees
to freeze future retirement benefits. The freeze, which will be completed January 1, 2020, may encourage retirement-eligible personnel (generally age 55) to
elect to retire earlier than anticipated.
To the extent that we lose experienced personnel, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel, and successfully manage
the transfer of critical knowledge. Competition for personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining personnel with the requisite skills
or clearances. We increasingly compete with commercial technology companies outside of the aerospace and defense industry for qualified technical, cyber
and scientific positions as the number of qualified domestic engineers is decreasing and the number of cyber professionals is not keeping up with demand. To
the extent that these companies grow at a faster rate or face fewer cost and product pricing constraints, they may be able to offer more attractive compensation
and other benefits to candidates or our existing employees. To the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher
labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees; we could experience difficulty in performing our contracts if we were unable
to do so. We also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business. While we have processes in place for management
transition and the transfer of knowledge, the loss of key personnel, coupled with an inability to adequately train other personnel, hire new personnel or
transfer knowledge, could significantly impact our ability to perform under our contracts.
Approximately 21% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Historically, where employees are covered
by collective bargaining agreements with various unions, we have been successful in negotiating renewals to expiring agreements without any material
disruption of operating activities. This does not assure, however, that we will be successful in our efforts to negotiate renewals of our existing collective
bargaining agreements in the future. If we encounter difficulties with renegotiations or renewals of collective bargaining arrangements or are unsuccessful in
those efforts, we could incur additional costs and experience work stoppages. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Any delays or work stoppages

could adversely affect our ability to perform under our contracts, which could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
Our estimates and projections may prove to be inaccurate.
The accounting for some of our most significant activities is based on judgments and estimates, which are complex and subject to many variables. For
example, accounting for sales using the percentage-of-completion method requires that we assess risks and make assumptions regarding schedule, cost,
technical and performance issues for each of our thousands of contracts, many of which are long-term in nature. Additionally, we initially allocate the
purchase price of acquired businesses based on a preliminary assessment of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For
significant acquisitions we may use a one-year measurement period to analyze and assess a number of factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair
values as of the acquisition date and could result in adjustments to asset and liability balances.
Another example is the $10.8 billion of goodwill assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 from previous acquisitions,
which represents approximately 23% of our total assets. These goodwill assets are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the
occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstances that indicate goodwill may be impaired. If we experience changes or factors arise that
negatively affect the expected cash flows of a reporting unit, we may be required to write off all or a portion of the reporting unit’s related goodwill assets. We
acquired Sikorsky in November 2015 and recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. As a result, the carrying value and fair value of
our Sikorsky reporting unit continue to be closely aligned. Therefore, any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or market pressures
could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections and could cause goodwill and intangible assets to be impaired.
Additionally, Sikorsky may not perform as expected, or demand for its products may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, including oil and
gas trends that are outside of our control.
Future changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, including those with retroactive effect, and audits by tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in
our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the
measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, and future changes in tax laws.
Actual financial results could differ from our judgments and estimates. See “Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and use of estimates.

ITEM 2.    Properties
At December 31, 2017, we owned or leased building space (including offices, manufacturing plants, warehouses, service centers, laboratories and other
facilities) at approximately 375 locations primarily in the U.S. Additionally, we manage or occupy approximately 15 government-owned facilities under lease
and other arrangements. At December 31, 2017, we had significant operations in the following locations:
•Aeronautics - Palmdale, California; Marietta, Georgia; Greenville, South Carolina; and Fort Worth, Texas.
•Missiles and Fire Control - Camden, Arkansas; Ocala and Orlando, Florida; Lexington, Kentucky; and Grand Prairie, Texas.
•Rotary and Mission Systems - Colorado Springs, Colorado; Shelton and Stratford, Connecticut; Orlando and Jupiter, Florida; Moorestown/Mt. Laurel,
New Jersey; Owego and Syracuse, New York; Manassas, Virginia; and Mielec, Poland.
•Space - Sunnyvale, California; Denver, Colorado; Valley Forge, Pennsylvania; and Reading, England.
•Corporate activities - Bethesda, Maryland.
The following is a summary of our square feet of floor space by business segment at December 31, 2017 (in millions):
  Owned  Leased  Government-
Owned  Total
Aeronautics  5.0  2.1  14.4  21.5 
Missiles and Fire Control  6.3  2.8  1.8  10.9 
Rotary and Mission Systems  11.2  6.6  0.4  18.2

Corporate activities  2.7  0.9  —  3.6 
Total  33.8  14.3  23.3  71.4 
We believe our facilities are in good condition and adequate for their current use. We may improve, replace or reduce facilities as considered appropriate
to meet the needs of our operations.
ITEM  3.    Legal Proceedings
We are a party to or have property subject to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising
under provisions relating to the protection of the environment and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned. These types
of matters could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the
outcome of each of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the corporation as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any
matter may have a material effect on our net earnings in any particular interim reporting period. We cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings
with certainty. These matters include the proceedings summarized in “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials
and remediation of contaminated sites. Due in part to the complexity and pervasiveness of these requirements, we are a party to or have property subject to
various lawsuits, proceedings and remediation obligations. The extent of our financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated at this time. For
information regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for remediation or clean-up to the extent
estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies - Environmental Matters” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to various audits and investigations by the U.S. Government to determine whether our operations are
being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. U.S. Government investigations of us, whether relating to government contracts or
conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us,
suspension, proposed debarment, debarment from eligibility for future U.S. Government contracting, or suspension of export privileges. Suspension or
debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our dependence on contracts with the U.S. Government. U.S. Government investigations
often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S., which
are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations and foreign procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with local regulations or applicable U.S.
Government regulations also may be audited or investigated.

(a) Our operating profit and net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations were affected by severance charges of $80 million
($52 million or $0.17 per share, after tax) in 2016; severance charges of $82 million ($53 million or $0.17  per share, after tax) in 2015; severance charges of $156 million
($101 million or $0.31 per share, after tax) in 2013. See “ Note 15 – Restructuring Char ges” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of
2016 and 2015 restructuring char ges.
(b) The impact of our postretir ement benefit plans can cause our operating profit, net earnings, cash flows and certain amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets to
fluctuate. Accordingly , our earnings were affected by a FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $876 million in 2017 , $902 million in 2016 , $400 million in 2015 , $317 million
in 2014 , and $(500) million in 2013 . We made $46 million in 2017 , $23 million in 2016 , and $5 million in 2015  of pension contributions (for our Sikorsky plan) and
$2.0 billion in 2014 , and $2.25 billion in 2013  (for our legacy plans), and these contributions caused fluctuations in our operating cash flows and cash balance between
each of those  years. Fluctuations in our total assets, total liabilities and equity between years 2013 to 2014 primarily were due to the annual measurement of the funded
status of our postretiremen t benefit plans. See “Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations for more information.
(c) In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a previously deferred non-cash gain of $198 million  related to properties sold in 2015 as a result of completing our remaining
obligations, which increased net earnings from continuing operations by $122 million  ($0.42  per share).
(d) In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a net one-time tax charge of $1.9 billion  ($6.69  per share) , substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to the
estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (see “Note 9 – Income Taxes” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). This charge along with our
annual re-measurement adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plans of $1.4 billion  resulted in a deficit in our total equity as of December 31, 2017.

Table of Contents
(e) Our net earnings from discontinued operations includes a $1.2 billion net gain in 2016 related to the divestiture of our IS&GS business.
(f) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
(g) Included in total current assets are assets of discontinued operations of $1.0 billion in 2015 , $900 million in 2014 , and $1.0 billion in 2013 . Included in total current
liabilities are liabilities of discontinued operations of $900 million in each of the years 2015 , 2014  and 2013 . Included in total assets are assets of discontinued operations
of $4.1 billion in 2015 , $4.2 billion in 2014 , and $3.9 billion in 2013 . Included in total liabilities are liabilities of discontinued operations of $1.2 billion in each of the
years 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .
(h) The increase in our goodwill and total assets from 2014 to 2015 was primarily attributable to the Sikorsky  acquisition, which resulted in an increase in goodwill and total
assets as of December 31, 2015 of $2.8 billion and $1 1.7 billion, respectively .
(i) The increase in our total debt and total liabilities from 2014 to 2015 was primarily a result of the debt incurred to fund the Sikorsky acquisition, as well as the issuance of
debt in February of 2015 for general corporate purposes (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures ” and “Note 10 – Debt ” inclu ded in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).
(j) The fluctuations in our net cash provided by operating activities between years 2013  to 2017  were due to changes in pension contributions, working capital and tax
payments made. See “Liquidity and Cash Flows” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information.
(k) The increase in our cash used for investing activities in 2015 was attributable to acquisitions of businesses , including the $9.0 billion acquisition of Sikorsky in 2015, net
of cash acquired (see “ Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures ” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
(l) The increase in our cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was primarily a result of the debt incurred to fund the Sikorsky acquisition (see “Note 10 – Debt ”
included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in our cash used for financing activities in 2014 was due to decreased proceeds from stock

ITEM 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Business Overview
We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of
advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system
integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial
applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2017, 69% of our $51.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S.
Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 58% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 30% were from international
customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our
main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space, previously known
as Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.
We operate in an environment characterized by both increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally.
A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our
products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our
customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent
markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives. We also expect to continue
to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to
succeed without limiting our ability to return a substantial portion of our free cash flow to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We
define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less capital expenditures as
presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
2018 Financial Trends
Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted two new accounting standards. Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, as amended (Topic 606) (commonly referred to as ASC 606) changes the way we recognize revenue from contracts with customers. ASU No.
2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) changes the income statement presentation of certain components of net periodic benefit cost related
to defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” (under the caption “Recent Accounting
Pronouncements”) included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the adoption of these standards.

(a) Total unallocated, net and consolidated operating profit includes an increase of $846 million  in 2017, with a correspon ding increase in other non-operating expense, net
for the expected impact of adopting ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retir ement Benefits (Topic 715) on January 1, 2018. See “Note 1 – Significant Accounting
Policies ” (under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”) included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
We expect 2018 net sales will increase in the low-single digit range from 2017 levels. The projected growth is driven by increased production and
sustainment volume on the F-35 program at Aeronautics as well as increased volume in tactical missiles programs at MFC, partially offset by decreased
volume at RMS and Space. Segment operating profit is expected to increase in the mid-single digit range from 2017 levels primarily driven by improved
performance at RMS. Accordingly, we expect that 2018 segment operating profit margin will slightly increase over our 2017 margin of 10.2%. Our outlook
for 2018 assumes the U.S. Government continues to support and fund our key programs, consistent with the government fiscal year (GFY) 2018 budget.
Changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2018 net sales and operating profit
margin. For additional information related to trends in net sales and operating profit at our business segments, see the “Business Segment Results of
Operations” discussion below.
We expect the net 2018 FAS/CAS pension benefit to be approximately $1.0 billion assuming a 3.625% discount rate (a 50 basis point decrease from the
end of 2016), an approximately 13.00% return on plan assets in 2017 (a 550 basis point increase from the expected rate of return at the end of 2016), and a
7.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years, and the revised longevity assumptions released on October 20, 2017 by the Society of
Actuaries. We will make contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary
contributions. As a result of these contributions, we do not expect any material qualified defined benefit cash funding will be required until 2021. We plan to
fund these contributions using a mix of cash on hand and commercial paper. While we do not anticipate a need to do so, our capital structure and resources
would allow us to issue new debt if circumstances change (see “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” discussion below). As a result of adopting ASU No.
2017-07, we expect to present a reclassification of non-service FAS net periodic benefit costs for all postretirement benefit plans (including the qualified
defined benefit pension plans) of approximately $870 million for the fiscal year 2018 from consolidated operating profit to other non-operating income, net
on our consolidated statements of earnings. This reclassification has no impact on our total business segment operating profit or consolidated net earnings.
Business Segment 2018 Financial Trends
Aeronautics
We expect Aeronautics’ 2018 net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range as compared to 2017 driven by increased production and
sustainment volume on the F-35 program. Operating profit is expected to increase in the low-single digit percentage range, resulting in slightly lower
operating profit margins.
25
Table of Contents
Missiles and Fire Control
We expect MFC’s net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2018 as compared to 2017 driven primarily by key contract awards and
volume in tactical missile programs. Operating profit is expected to increase in the low-single digit percentage range in 2018 as compared to 2017 due
primarily to new development volume associated with recent key contract awards. Accordingly, operating profit margin is expected to slightly decrease from
2017 levels.
Rotary and Mission Systems
We expect RMS’ net sales to decrease in the low-single digit percentage range as compared to 2017 driven primarily by lower volume in our Sikorsky
business partially offset by higher volume in our training and logistics services and integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) lines of business.
Operating profit is expected to increase in the low double digit percentage range driven by performance improvements in the IWSS and C4ISR and Undersea
Systems and Sensors (C4USS) lines of business. Operating profit margins are also expected to improve from 2017 levels.
Space
We expect Space's 2018 net sales to decrease in the mid-single digit percentage range compared to 2017, driven by lower volume resulting from program
lifecycles on government satellite programs and lower cost on follow-on contracts. Operating profit in 2018 is expected to be comparable to 2017. As a result
operating profit margin is expected to increase slightly from 2017 levels.
Portfolio Shaping Activities
We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in
part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.
We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and
allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could
perform better outside of our organization. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements
regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, ventures and equity investments.
Divestiture of the Information Systems & Global Solutions Business
On August 16, 2016, we divested our former Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business, which merged with Leidos Holdings, Inc.
(Leidos), in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the “Transaction”). The Transaction was completed in a multi-step process pursuant to which we initially
contributed the IS&GS business to Abacus Innovations Corporation (Abacus), a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin created to facilitate the
Transaction, and the common stock of Abacus was distributed to participating Lockheed Martin stockholders through an exchange offer. Under the terms of
the exchange offer, Lockheed Martin stockholders had the option to exchange shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of Abacus common stock.
At the conclusion of the exchange offer, all shares of Abacus common stock were exchanged for 9,369,694 shares of Lockheed Martin common stock held by
Lockheed Martin stockholders that elected to participate in the exchange. The shares of Lockheed Martin common stock that were exchanged and accepted
were retired, reducing the number of shares of our common stock outstanding by approximately 3%. Following the exchange offer, Abacus merged with a
subsidiary of Leidos, with Abacus continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leidos. As part of the merger, each share of
Abacus common stock was automatically converted into one share of Leidos common stock. We did not receive any shares of Leidos common stock as part of
the Transaction and do not hold any shares of Leidos or Abacus common stock following the Transaction. Based on an opinion of outside tax counsel, subject
to customary qualifications and based on factual representations, the exchange offer and merger will qualify as tax-free transactions to Lockheed Martin and
its stockholders, except to the extent that cash was paid to Lockheed Martin stockholders in lieu of fractional shares.
In connection with the Transaction, Abacus borrowed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.84 billion under term loan facilities with third
party financial institutions, the proceeds of which were used to make a one-time special cash payment of $1.80 billion to Lockheed Martin and to pay
associated borrowing fees and expenses. The entire special cash payment was used to repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock during the third and
fourth quarters of 2016. The obligations under the Abacus term loan facilities were guaranteed by Leidos as part of the Transaction.
As a result of the Transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion, including $1.2 billion recognized in 2016. The net gain represents
the $2.5 billion fair value of the shares of Lockheed Martin common stock exchanged and retired
26
Table of Contents
as part of the exchange offer, plus the $1.8 billion one-time special cash payment, less the net book value of the IS&GS business of about $3.0 billion at
August 16, 2016 and other adjustments of about $100 million. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized an additional gain of $73 million, which
reflects certain post-closing adjustments, including certain tax adjustments and the final determination of net working capital.
We classified the operating results of our former IS&GS business as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, as the divestiture of this business represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. However, the cash
flows generated by the IS&GS business have not been reclassified in our consolidated statements of cash flows as we retained this cash as part of the
Transaction.
Acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation
On November 6, 2015, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 19, 2015 by and between us and United Technologies Corporation
(UTC) and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of UTC, we completed the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and certain affiliated companies
(collectively “Sikorsky”) for $9.0 billion, net of cash acquired. Sikorsky, a global company primarily engaged in the design, manufacture, service and support
of military and commercial helicopters, has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, aligned under the RMS business segment. We funded the acquisition
with new debt issuances, commercial paper and cash on hand. We and UTC made a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code,
which treats the transaction as an asset purchase for tax purposes. This election generates a cash tax benefit for us and our stockholders. The 2015 financial
results of the acquired Sikorsky business have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through
December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of Sikorsky’s operations.
See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the debt we incurred in connection with the Sikorsky acquisition.
Other
On August 24, 2016, we increased our ownership interest in the AWE Management Limited (AWE) joint venture, which operates the United Kingdom’s
nuclear deterrent program, from 33% to 51%. At which time, we began consolidating AWE. Consequently, our operating results include 100% of AWE’s
sales and 51% of its operating profit. Prior to increasing our ownership interest, we accounted for our investment in AWE using the equity method of
accounting. Under the equity method, we recognized only 33% of AWE’s earnings or losses and no sales. Accordingly, prior to August 24, 2016, the date we
obtained control, we recorded 33% of AWE’s net earnings in our operating results and subsequent to August 24, 2016, we recognized 100% of AWE’s sales
and 51% of its operating profit.
For additional information, see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Industry Considerations
U.S. Government Funding
The U.S. Government has not yet passed an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018 (the U.S. Government’s fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on
September 30). However, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government passed a continuing resolution funding measure to finance all U.S. Government
activities through January 19, 2018. Congress was unable to reach an agreement to continue to fund the government prior to midnight on January 19, 2018,
and the U.S. Government was forced to shut down for three days. On January 22, 2018, the U.S. Government passed a continuing resolution funding measure
to finance all U.S. Government activities through February 8, 2018. Under this continuing resolution, partial-year funding at amounts consistent with
appropriated levels for fiscal year 2017 are available, subject to certain restrictions, but new spending initiatives are not authorized. Our key programs
continue to be supported and funded despite the continuing resolution financing mechanism. However, during periods covered by continuing resolutions or
until the regular appropriation bills are passed, we may experience delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and those delays
may affect our results of operations.
In May 2017, the President submitted a budget proposal for GFY 2018 to Congress, which includes a base budget for the DoD of $575 billion,
approximately $52 billion above the spending limits established under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the Budget Control Act) (described below) and an
increase of $32 billion over the fiscal year 2017 funding level. The President’s budget requests also includes funding of $65 billion for Overseas Contingency
Operations (OCO) / Global War on Terror (GWOT), which is not subject to the Budget Control Act spending limits. Congress must approve or revise the
President’s GFY 2018 budget proposals through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which would then require final Presidential
approval.
27
Table of Contents
In December, the President signed the GFY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law. The NDAA authorizes funding levels for the
agencies responsible for defense and sets forth how the funds will be used. The NDAA authorizes $626 billion in base defense spending ($606 billion for
DoD) and $66 billion in OCO funds, exceeding the Budget Control Act limits for base defense spending by $85 billion. The OCO account is exempt from the
Budget Control Act. It remains uncertain when an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018 will be enacted or at what levels.
Currently, U.S. defense spending through fiscal year 2021 remains subject to statutory spending limits established by the Budget Control Act. The
spending limits were modified for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. However, these acts did not provide relief to the spending limits beyond fiscal year 2017. If Congress approves the President’s
budget proposal or other appropriation legislation with funding levels that exceed the spending limits, automatic across-the-board spending reductions, known
as sequestration, would be triggered to reduce funding back to the spending limits. As currently enacted, the Budget Control Act limits defense spending to
$549 billion (approximately $522 billion for DoD) for fiscal year 2018 with modest increases of about 2.5% per year through 2021. The President’s budget
proposal as well as defense budget estimates for fiscal year 2018 and beyond exceed the spending limits established by the Budget Control Act. As a result,
continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain unless the Budget Control Act is repealed or significantly modified. The
investments and acquisitions we have made in recent years have sought to align our businesses with what we believe are the most critical national priorities
and mission areas. However, the possibility remains that our programs could be materially reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the U.S.
Government’s continuing assessment of priorities, changes in government priorities, the implementation of sequestration (particularly in those circumstances
where sequestration is implemented across-the-board without regard to national priorities), or other budget cuts in lieu of sequestration.
On September 8, 2017, Congress passed legislation suspending the debt ceiling through December 8, 2017. On December 9, 2017, the debt limit was
increased to the amount of debt the U.S. Government held outstanding on that date. However, despite using cash on hand and measures employed by the
Department of Treasury, the debt ceiling is expected to be reached again in early 2018. Congress will need to raise the debt limit for the U.S. Government to
continue borrowing money before these measures are exhausted. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the U.S. Government may not be able to pay for expenditures
or fulfill its funding obligations and there could be significant disruption to all discretionary programs.
We anticipate there will continue to be a significant amount of debate and negotiations within the U.S. Government over defense spending and the debt
ceiling. In the context of these negotiations, it is possible that existing cuts to government programs could be kept in place, replaced with different spending
cuts, and/or replaced with a package of broader reforms to reduce the federal deficit. However, we continue to believe that our portfolio of products and
services will continue to be well supported in a strategically focused allocation of budget resources.
International Business
A key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our
relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. We conduct business with international customers through each of our business
segments through either FMS or direct sales to international customers.
International customers accounted for 36% of Aeronautics’ 2017 net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which
includes commitments from the U.S. Government and eight international partner countries and three international customers, as well as expressions of interest
from other countries. The U.S. Government and the eight partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of
the F-35 program. The international commitment to the program continues to grow. Through 2017, $8.2 billion of funding was awarded for the F-35 program
under Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 11 contract for aircraft currently in production. This award is for international F-35 partners and FMS customers.
Additionally in 2017, F‑35 aircraft deliveries continued from the Final Assembly and Check-Out (FACO) facility in Italy and were initiated at the Japan
FACO facility. Other areas of international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the C-130J and F-16 programs. During 2017, six C-130J
aircraft were delivered to India. In November 2017, the U.S. and Bahrain signed a government-to-government agreement, or a Letter of Offer and Acceptance
(LOA), regarding the sale of new production Block 70 aircraft for the Royal Bahraini Air Force. We are transitioning F-16 production to Greenville, South
Carolina, to support the Bahrain production program and other emerging F-16 production requirements.
In 2017, international customers accounted for 34% of MFC’s net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international
interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude
Area Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 is an advanced missile defense system designed to intercept incoming airborne threats. We have ongoing PAC-3
programs for sustainment activities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan. Additionally during 2017, we received
an order for PAC-3 systems from Japan. THAAD is an integrated system designed to protect against high altitude ballistic missile threats. UAE is an
international
28
Table of Contents
customer for THAAD, and other countries in the Middle East, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense
systems, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who took formal steps in October 2017 to begin the purchase of THAAD. Additionally, we continue to see
international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products, including in Poland, where we will be submitting a proposal for a Multiple Launch
Rocket System (MLRS). Other MFC international customers include the United Kingdom, Germany, India, Kuwait, and Bahrain.
In 2017, international customers accounted for 28% of RMS’ net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the
Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. We perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for
ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Republic of Korea, and Australia. We have ongoing programs in Canada and Chile for combat systems
equipment upgrades on Halifax-class and Type 23 frigates. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the
United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Canada, Singapore, and Australia. In addition, Sikorsky adds a significant international component to the
RMS business segment with an installed base of over 1,000 aircraft internationally. We have active development, production, and sustainment support of the
S-70i Black Hawk and MH-60 Seahawk aircraft to foreign military customers, including Chile, Australia, Denmark, Taiwan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
and Colombia. Commercial aircraft are sold to customers in the oil and gas industry, emergency medical evacuation, search and rescue fleets, and VIP
customers in over 30 countries.
International customers accounted for 14% of Space’s 2017 net sales. Our Space business segment includes the operations of AWE, which operates the
United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program. The work at AWE covers the entire life cycle, from initial concept, assessment and design, through component
manufacture and assembly, in-service support and decommissioning and disposal. In addition, Space has international contracts with the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia and Japan to design and manufacture geostationary communication satellites using the A2100 satellite platform.
Status of the F-35 Program
The F-35 program consists of development contracts, production contracts and sustainment activities. The development contracts are being performed
concurrent with the production contracts. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts is used for complex programs to test aircraft,
shorten the time to field systems, and achieve overall cost savings. The System Development and Demonstration (SDD) portion of the development contracts
was substantially completed in 2017, with over 99% of flight test objectives met through over 9,200 flights. Approximately 70 flights remain and are
expected to be completed in early 2018. Additionally, the final logistics and training capability is planned for 2018 and new Third Life structural testing
added to the SDD portion in 2013 is scheduled to be completed in 2019. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S.
Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments from our eight
international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries.
Operationally, the U.S. Government continues to complete various tests, including ship trials, mission system evaluations and weapons testing, and the F-
35 aircraft fleet recently surpassed 118,000 flight hours. Progress also continues on the production of aircraft. In January 2017, the program achieved a major
milestone when the U.S. Navy received its first F‑35C carrier variant at NAS Lemoore, California, as we continue to advance towards the U.S. Navy
declaring the F‑35C carrier variant ready for combat. The U.S. Marine Corps completed the deployment of 16 F-35B variants now permanently assigned to
Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. In June 2017, the first Japanese assembled F‑35A variant was unveiled at the FACO facility in Nagoya, Japan. This
aircraft, delivered in September 2017, marks the first of nearly 40 jets that will be produced for the Japanese Ministry of Defense at this location. Similarly, in
May 2017, the first F‑35B variant to be assembled outside the U.S. was rolled out at the Italian FACO facility, which has already delivered multiple
F‑35A variants and is slated to produce over 100 aircraft in total. As of December 31, 2017, we have delivered 266 production aircraft to our U.S. and
international partners, and we have 235 production aircraft in backlog, including orders from our international partners.
Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule,
cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include,
but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance, software development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and
warranties, receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests, findings resulting from testing, and operating the
aircraft.
Consolidated Results of Operations
Since our operating cycle is primarily long term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and
related activities with varying delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be
indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among years should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts
cited in these discussions are presented

(a) For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating profit includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million  related to properties sold in 2015 (see
“Note 8 – Property , Plant and Equipment, net” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information) and a $64 million  charge, which
represents our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by our equity method investee, Advanced Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center LLC
venture (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies ” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). For the year ended
December 31, 2016, operating profit includes a non-cash gain on the step acquisition of AWE of approximately $104 million  (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and
Divestitures ” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating profit includes $45
million of operating loss at Sikorsky , which is less than 1% of consolidated operating profit in 2015. Sikorsky’ s operating loss is net of intangible amortization and
adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business in the fourth quarter of 2015 (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures ” included in our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).
(b) In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a net one-time tax charge of $1.9 billion  ($6.69  per share) , substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to the
estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See “Income Tax Expense” section below and “Note 9 – Income Taxes” inclu ded in our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.
Certain amounts reported in other income, net, primarily our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit
of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in our discussion of our business segment results of operations.
Net Sales
We generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions):
  2017  2016  2015 
Products  $ 43,875  $ 40,365  $ 34,868 
% of total net sales  85.9% 85.4% 86.0%
Services  7,173  6,883  5,668 
% of total net sales  14.1% 14.6% 14.0%
Total net sales  $ 51,048  $ 47,248  $ 40,536 
Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we record
net sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion.
The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our
consolidated cost of sales and our business segment

results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the
percentage-of-completion method.
Product Sales
Product sales increased $3.5 billion, or 9%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $2.1 billion at
Aeronautics, $680 million at RMS and $425 million at MFC. The increase in product sales at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to higher sales for the F-
35 program due to increased production volume, higher sales for the C-130 program due to increased deliveries and aircraft configuration mix and higher
volume on aircraft modernization for the F-16 program, partially offset by lower sales for the C-5 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries. The increase in
product sales at RMS was primarily due to certain adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition of Sikorsky and higher volume on
training and logistics services programs. Higher product sales at MFC were primarily due to higher sales for tactical missile programs due to product
configuration mix and increased deliveries (primarily Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM)), higher sales for air and missile defense systems due to
contract mix (primarily PAC-3), higher volume on certain programs (primarily THAAD), and increased deliveries for fire control programs (primarily Low
Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN®) and SNIPER®).
Product sales increased $5.5 billion, or 16%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $3.7 billion at
RMS and approximately $1.8 billion at Aeronautics. The increase in product sales at RMS was primarily attributable to sales from Sikorsky, which was
acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase was partially offset by lower net sales for training and logistics programs due to the divestiture of our
Lockheed Martin Commercial Flight Training (LMCFT) business, which reported sales through the May 2, 2016 divestiture date. The increase at Aeronautics
was primarily attributable to the F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and the C-130 program due to increased aircraft deliveries.
Service Sales
Service sales increased $290 million, or 4%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $245 million at
Aeronautics and $180 million at MFC, partially offset by lower service sales of about $210 million at Space. The increase in service sales at Aeronautics was
primarily due to higher sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and F-16 programs). Higher service sales at MFC were primarily attributable to increased
volume on sustainment activities (primarily PAC-3 and Hellfire). The decrease in service sales at Space was primarily due to lower space transportation
programs due to a reduction in launch-related events, partially offset by increased volume on government satellite services.
Service sales increased $1.2 billion, or 21%, in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $700 million at RMS and
approximately $360 million at Aeronautics. The increase in service sales at RMS was primarily attributable to sales from Sikorsky, which was acquired in the
fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in service sales at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to increased sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and F-16
programs).
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and
administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain
contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for
estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions):
  2017  2016  2015 
Cost of sales – products  $ (39,750)  $(36,616)  $(31,091) 
% of product sales  90.6% 90.7% 89.2%
Cost of sales – services  (6,405)  (6,040)  (4,824) 
% of service sales  89.3% 87.8% 85.1%
Severance charges  —  (80)  (82) 
Other unallocated, net  655  550  (47) 
Total cost of sales  $ (45,500)  $(42,186)  $(36,044) 
Due to the nature of percentage-of-completion accounting, changes in our cost of sales for both products and services are typically accompanied by
changes in our net sales. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales
31
Table of Contents
for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of
operations. We have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations.
Product Costs
Product costs increased approximately $3.1 billion, or 9%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased product costs of
about $1.8 billion at Aeronautics, $665 million at RMS and $420 million at MFC. The increase in product costs at Aeronautics was primarily due to increased
volume on aircraft production for the F-35 program and higher cost for the C-130 program due to increased deliveries and aircraft configuration mix and
higher cost on aircraft modernization for the F-16 program, partially offset by lower cost for the C-5 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries. Higher product
costs at RMS were primarily due to higher volume on certain helicopter programs, a net increase in charges for C4USS programs for performance matters on
the EADGE-T contract and higher cost for training and logistics services programs due to higher volume. The increase in product costs at MFC was primarily
attributable to higher cost for air and missile defense systems due to higher volume (primarily THAAD) and contract mix (primarily PAC-3), higher cost for
tactical missile programs due to product configuration mix (primarily JASSM) and increased deliveries for fire control programs (primarily LANTIRN® and
SNIPER®).
Product costs increased approximately $5.5 billion, or 18%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased product costs of
about $3.6 billion at RMS and about $1.6 billion at Aeronautics. The increase at RMS was primarily attributable to product costs generated by Sikorsky,
which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to increased volume on aircraft production for the F-
35 program and increased aircraft deliveries on the C-130 program.
Service Costs
Service costs increased approximately $365 million, or 6%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased service costs of about $265 million at
Aeronautics, $150 million at MFC and $110 million at RMS. This increase was partially offset by lower service costs of about $160 million at Space. Higher
service cost at Aeronautics were primarily due to increased sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and F-16 programs) and higher cost for the C-130
program due to timing of expenses for sustainment programs. Higher service costs at MFC were primarily attributable to higher sustainment activities
(primarily PAC-3 and Hellfire). The increase in service costs at RMS was primarily attributable to higher Sikorsky sustainment activities for international
programs. Lower service costs at Space were primarily due to lower space transportation programs due to a reduction in launch-related events, partially offset
by increased volume on government satellite services.
Service costs increased approximately $1.2 billion, or 25%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased service costs of about $670 million at
RMS and approximately $400 million at Aeronautics. The increase at RMS was primarily attributable to service costs generated by Sikorsky, which was
acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase at Aeronautics was primarily attributable to increased sustainment activities (primarily the F-35 and the
F-22 programs).
Restructuring Charges
2016 Actions
During 2016, we recorded severance charges totaling approximately $80 million related to our Aeronautics business segment. The charges consisted of
severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated
employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several
quarters. As of the end of the first quarter of 2017, we had substantially paid the severance costs associated with these actions.
2015 Actions
During 2015, we recorded severance charges totaling $82 million, of which $67 million related to our RMS business segment and $15 million related to
businesses that were reported in our former IS&GS business prior to our fourth quarter 2015 program realignment. The charges consisted of severance costs
associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated employees receive
lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service. As of December 31, 2016, we substantially paid the severance costs associated with these
actions.
In connection with the Sikorsky acquisition, we assumed obligations related to certain restructuring actions committed to by Sikorsky in June 2015. Net
of amounts we anticipate to recover through the pricing of our products and services to our customers, we incurred and paid $40 million of costs in 2016
related to these actions.
32
Table of Contents
We have recovered a substantial amount of the restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other
customers in future periods, with the impact included in the respective business segment’s results of operations.
Other Unallocated, Net
Other unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment as described in the “Business Segment Results of Operations” section below,
stock-based compensation and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the cost of sales
for products and services. Other unallocated, net was a net reduction to expense of $655 million and $550 million in 2017 and 2016, compared to a net
increase to expense of $47 million in 2015.
The increase in net reduction to expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to corporate overhead costs reclassified during 2016
from the former IS&GS business to other unallocated, net, partially offset by fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, none of
which were individually significant. See “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information about costs reclassified to other unallocated, net.
Additionally, the fluctuation between each respective period was also impacted by the change in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $876 million in
2017, $902 million in 2016 and $400 million in 2015, partially offset by fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, none of which
were individually significant. The decrease in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment from 2016 to 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in FAS pension
expense related to a lower discount rate and lower expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; mostly offset by the increase in U.S. Government Cost
Accounting Standards (CAS) pension cost due to the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization. The increase in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment from 2015
to 2016 was primarily attributable to the increase in U.S. Government CAS pension cost due to the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization. See “Critical
Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” discussion below for more information on our CAS pension cost.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net primarily includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees and gains or losses for acquisitions and divestitures.
Other income, net in 2017 was $373 million, compared to $487 million in 2016 and $220 million in 2015. The decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 was
primarily attributable to decreased earnings generated by equity method investees and recognition in the first quarter of 2017 of our portion of a non-cash
asset impairment charge recorded by our equity method investee, Advanced Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center LLC (AAMROC). These
decreases were partially offset by the recognition in the fourth quarter of 2017 of a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million related
to properties sold in 2015, which was greater than the net gain of $104 million recognized in the third quarter of 2016 on the step acquisition of AWE.
The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily attributable to the non-cash net gain of $104 million associated with obtaining a controlling
interest in AWE and approximately $120 million of increased earnings generated by equity method investees as discussed in the “Business Segment Results
of Operations” section below. Additionally, in 2015 we incurred a $90 million non-cash impairment charge related to our decision in 2015 to divest our
LMCFT business.
Interest Expense
Interest expense in 2017 was $651 million, compared to $663 million in 2016 and $443 million in 2015. The decrease in interest expense in 2017 resulted
primarily from our scheduled repayment of $952 million of debt during 2016. The increase in interest expense in 2016 resulted from the debt we incurred to
fund the acquisition of Sikorsky, and the issuance of notes in February of 2015 for general corporate purposes. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other”
included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a
discussion of our debt.
Other Non-Operating (Expense) Income, Net
Other non-operating (expense) income, net in 2017 was comparable to 2016. Other non-operating income, net decreased $30 million from 2015 to 2016
primarily due to a gain from the sale of an investment in 2015, which did not recur in 2016.
Income Tax Expense
On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate
income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we wrote down our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 by
$1.9 billion to reflect the estimated impact of the Tax Act. We recorded a
33
Table of Contents
corresponding net one-time charge of $1.9 billion ($6.69 per share), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to enactment of the Tax Act,
the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate (approximately $1.8 billion), a deemed repatriation tax
(approximately $43 million), and a reduction in the U.S. manufacturing benefit (approximately $81 million) as a result of our decision to accelerate
contributions to our pension fund in 2018 in order to receive a tax deduction in 2017.
While we have substantially completed our provisional analysis of the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recorded a reasonable estimate of such
effects, the net one-time charge related to the Tax Act may differ, possibly materially, due to, among other things, further refinement of our calculations,
changes in interpretations and assumptions that we have made, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Government, and actions and related
accounting policy decisions we may take as a result of the Tax Act. We will complete our analysis over a one-year measurement period ending December 22,
2018, and any adjustments during this measurement period will be included in net earnings from continuing operations as an adjustment to income tax
expense in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined. 
Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 63.4% for 2017, 23.2% for 2016, and 27.3% for 2015. The net one-time charge related to
the Tax Act increased our 2017 effective income tax rate by 36.9 percentage points. Our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments in years after 2017
are expected to benefit materially from the enactment of the Tax Act.
The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan
feature, and the U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credit. The U.S. manufacturing benefit was insignificant for 2017, compared to a reduction of our
effective tax rate by 2.4 percentage points for 2016 and 2.9 percentage points for 2015. The 2017 benefit was reduced by $81 million because of our 2017
decision after enactment of the Tax Act to make accelerated contributions of cash in 2018 to our defined benefit pension plans. The R&D tax credit reduced
our effective tax rate by 2.2 percentage points in both 2017 and 2016, and 1.6 percentage points in 2015. The rate for 2016 also benefited from the nontaxable
gain recorded in connection with the consolidation of AWE.
In addition, the rate for 2017 and 2016 benefited from tax benefits related to employee share-based payment awards, which are now recorded in earnings
as income tax benefit or expense, effective with the adoption of an accounting standard update during 2016. Accordingly, we recognized additional income
tax benefits of $106 million and $152 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 2.0
percentage points and 3.1 percentage points.
As a result of a decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT business in 2016, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $90 million. This
charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about $80 million. The net impact of the resulting tax benefit reduced our effective income tax rate
by 1.2 percentage points in 2015.
Future changes in tax laws could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability
balances, and stockholders’ equity. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our
postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, and future changes in tax laws.    
Net Earnings from Continuing Operations
We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $1.9 billion ($6.64 per share) in 2017, $3.8 billion ($12.38 per share) in 2016 and $3.1 billion
($9.93 per share) in 2015. Both net earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per
share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately five million common shares outstanding from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 as a result
of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. From December 31, 2015 to
December 31, 2016 earnings per share benefited from a decrease of approximately 14 million common shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases and
the completion of the exchange offer, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.
Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations
We reported net earnings from discontinued operations related to the 2016 divestiture of the IS&GS business of $73 million ($0.25 per share) in 2017,
$1.5 billion ($5.11 per share) in 2016 and $479 million ($1.53 per share) in 2015. Net earnings from discontinued operations in 2017 reflects certain post-
closing adjustments, including final working capital and tax adjustments. Net earnings from discontinued operations in 2016 included an initial net gain of
approximately $1.2 billion recognized as a result of the divestiture of the IS&GS business.
34
Table of Contents
Net Earnings
We reported net earnings of $2.0 billion ($6.89 per share) in 2017, $5.3 billion ($17.49 per share) in 2016 and $3.6 billion ($11.46 per share) in 2015.
Business Segment Results of Operations
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and
services offered. The financial information in the following tables includes the results of businesses we have acquired from their respective dates of
acquisition and excludes businesses included in discontinued operations (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements) for all years presented. Net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation.
Operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees because the operating activities of the
equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. United Launch Alliance (ULA), results of which are included in our
Space business segment, is one of our largest equity method investees. Operating profit of our business segments excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment
described below; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating
performance, such as charges related to goodwill impairments (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements) and significant severance actions (see “Note 15 – Restructuring Charges” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements);
gains or losses from significant divestitures (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); the
effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. These items are
included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit.
Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which we
refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, the
CAS pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Since our consolidated financial statements must present
pension expense calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP, which we refer to as FAS pension expense, the FAS/CAS pension
adjustment increases or decreases the CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations to equal the FAS pension expense. As a
result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds FAS pension expense, which occurred for 2017, 2016 and 2015, we have a favorable FAS/CAS pension
adjustment.

(a) On August 24, 2016, our ownership interest in the A WE joint venture increased from 33% to 51% and we were required to change our accounting for this investment from
the equity method to consolidation. As a result of the increased ownership interest, we recognized a non-cash gain of $127 million  at our Space business segment, which
increased net earnings from  continuing operations by $104 million  ($0.34  per share) in 2016. See “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures ” includ ed in our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).
(b) FAS pension expense, CAS pension costs and severa nce charges reflect the reclassification for discontinued operations presentation of benefits related to former IS&GS
salaried employees (see “ Note 1 1 – Postretirement Benefit Plans ” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
(c) The higher F AS expense in 2017  is primarily due to a lower  discount rate and lower expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in 2017  versus 2016. The higher CAS
pension cost primarily reflects the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization (see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans ” included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).
(d) We expect a F AS/CAS pension adjustment in 2018  of about $1.0 billion (see “Critical Accounting Policies – Postretirement Benefit Plans” discussion below).
(e) See “Consoli dated Results of Operations – Restructuring Char ges” discussion above for informatio n on charges related to certain severance actions at our business
segments. Severance char ges for initiatives that are not significant are included in business segment operating profit.
(f) Other , net in 2017 includes  a previously deferred non-cash gain of $198 million  related to properties sold in 2015 as a result of completing our remaining obligations  (see
“Note 8 – Property , Plant and Equipment, net” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information) and a $64 million  charge, which
represents our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by our equity method investee, AMMROC (see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies ”
included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).
(g) Other , net in 2015 includes a non-cash asset impairment char ge of approximately $90 million  related to our decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT  business (see “Note 3 –
Acquisitions and Divestitures ” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). This charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about
$80 million , which is recorded in income tax expense. The net impact reduced net earnings by about $10 million . Addit ionally other , net in 2015 includes approximat ely
$38 million  of non-recoverable transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Sikorsky .
The following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. Backlog was approximately $99.9 billion, $96.2 billion
and $94.8 billion at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both
authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include
unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $73.6 billion at
December 31, 2017.

Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense.
Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the
business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales
and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.
We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner
specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that
product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts
generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under
circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our
U.S. Government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or
components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices.
Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to
the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the
contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g.,
the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation
agreements required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the
ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase
during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the
estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase.
All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate.
We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The operating results of
these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our
other programs.
Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted
through the U.S. Government. We account for these contracts, as well as product contracts with non-U.S. Government customers, using the percentage-of-
completion method of accounting, which represent substantially all of our net sales. We derive our remaining net sales from contracts to provide services to
non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under the services method of accounting.
Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular
contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs plus a fee.
For fixed-priced contracts, net sales and cost of sales are recognized as products are delivered or as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the percentage-of-
completion method of accounting, changes in our cost of sales are typically accompanied by a related change in our net sales.
Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or
operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating
profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract.
In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit
booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically
referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely,
conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate.
Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating
profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters,
cost recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of
contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes;
asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or
other matters are presented net of state income taxes.

As previously disclosed, we have a program to design, integrate, and install an air missile defense C4I systems for an international customer that has
experienced performance issues and for which we have periodically accrued reserves. In 2017, we revised our estimated costs to complete the program,
EADGE-T, as a consequence of ongoing performance matters and recorded an additional charge of $120 million ($74 million or $0.25 per share, after tax) at
our RMS business segment. As of December 31, 2017, cumulative losses, including reserves, remained at approximately $260 million on this program. We
are continuing to monitor the viability of the program and the available options and could record additional charges in future periods. However, based on the
reserves already accrued and our current estimate of the costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional charges, if any, would
be material.
We have two commercial satellite programs at our Space business segment, for which we have experienced performance issues related to the
development and integration of a modernized LM 2100 satellite platform. These commercial programs require the development of new satellite technology to
enhance the LM 2100’s power, propulsion and electronics, among other items. The enhanced satellite is expected to benefit other commercial and government
satellite programs. We have periodically revised our estimated costs to complete these developmental commercial programs. We have recorded cumulative
losses of approximately $305 million as of December 31, 2017, including approximately $135 million ($83 million or $0.29 per share, after tax) recorded
during the year ended December 31, 2017. While these losses reflect our estimated total losses on the programs, we will continue to incur unrecovered costs
each period until we complete these programs and may have to record additional loss reserves in future periods, which could be material to our operating
results. While we do not currently anticipate recording additional loss reserves, the programs remain developmental and further challenges in the delivery and
integration of new satellite technology, anomalies discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework, further schedule delays and potential penalties
could require that we record additional reserves. We do not currently expect to be able to meet the delivery schedule under the contracts and have informed
the customers. The customers could seek to exercise a termination right under the contracts, in which case we would have to refund the payments we have
received and pay certain penalties. However, we think the probability that the customers will seek to exercise any termination right is remote as the delay
beyond the termination date is modest and the customers have an immediate need for the satellites.
Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, net of state income taxes,
increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.5 billion in both 2017 and 2016 and $1.7 billion in 2015. The consolidated net adjustments in 2017
were comparable to 2016, with increases in profit booking rate adjustments at our Aeronautics and Space business segments, offset by decreases at our MFC
and RMS business segments. The decrease in our consolidated net adjustments in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in profit booking
rate adjustments at our MFC and Space business segments, partially offset by an increase at our RMS business segment. The consolidated net adjustments for
2017 are inclusive of approximately $790 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on the EADGE-T contract, Vertical
Launching System (VLS) program and other programs at RMS and on commercial satellite programs at Space. The consolidated net adjustments for 2016 are
inclusive of approximately $530 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on an international program at RMS and on
commercial satellite programs at Space. The consolidated net adjustments for 2015 are inclusive of approximately $550 million in unfavorable items, which
include reserves for performance matters on the EADGE-T contract at RMS and on commercial satellite programs at Space.
Aeronautics
Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of
advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include
the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C‑130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor and C-5M Super Galaxy. Aeronautics’ operating results
included the following (in millions):
  2017  2016  2015 
Net sales  $ 20,148  $ 17,769  $ 15,570 
Operating profit  2,164  1,887  1,681 
Operating margin  10.7% 10.6% 10.8%
Backlog at year-end  $ 35,832  $ 34,182  $ 31,842 
2017 compared to 2016
Aeronautics’ net sales in 2017 increased $2.4 billion, or 13%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of
approximately $2.0 billion for the F-35 program due to increased volume on production and sustainment; about $260 million for the C-130 program due to
increased deliveries (26 aircraft delivered in 2017 compared to 24 in 2016) and due to aircraft configuration mix, partially offset by lower volume for
sustainment programs; and about $55 million for the F-16 program due to higher volume on aircraft modernization programs, partially offset by lower
deliveries (eight aircraft delivered in 2017
38
Table of Contents
compared to 12 in 2016). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $155 million for the C-5 program due to lower deliveries
(seven aircraft delivered in 2017 compared to nine in 2016).
Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2017 increased $277 million, or 15%, compared to 2016. Operating profit increased approximately $290 million for the
F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities and higher risk retirements and about $85 million for the F-
16 program due to higher risk retirements and higher volume on aircraft modernization programs, partially offset by lower deliveries. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease of about $30 million due to lower equity earnings from an investee; about $25 million for the C-130 program primarily due to
lower volume and the timing of expenses for sustainment programs; and approximately $45 million for other aeronautics programs primarily due to lower risk
retirements and the establishment of a reserve recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate
adjustments, were about $175 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016.    
2016 compared to 2015
Aeronautics’ net sales in 2016 increased $2.2 billion, or 14%, compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $1.7
billion for the F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities, partially offset by lower volume on development
activities; and approximately $290 million for the C-130 program due to increased deliveries (24 aircraft delivered in 2016 compared to 21 in 2015) and
increased sustainment activities; and approximately $250 million for the F-16 program primarily due to higher volume on aircraft modernization programs.
The increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $55 million for the C-5 program due to decreased sustainment activities.
Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2016 increased $206 million, or 12%, compared to 2015. Operating profit increased approximately $195 million for the
F-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities and higher risk retirements; and by approximately $60 million for
aircraft support and maintenance programs due to higher risk retirements and increased volume. These increases were partially offset by lower operating
profit of approximately $65 million for the C-130 program due to contract mix and lower risk retirements. Adjustments not related to volume, including net
profit booking rate adjustments, were approximately $20 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015.
Backlog
Backlog increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher orders on F-35 production and sustainment programs. Backlog increased in 2016
compared to 2015 primarily due to higher orders on F-35 production and sustainment programs.
Missiles and Fire Control
Our MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire
control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy
management solutions. MFC’s major programs include PAC‑3, THAAD, MLRS, Hellfire, JASSM, Javelin, Apache, SNIPER®, LANTIRN® and Special
Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services (SOF CLSS). In August 2017, we were awarded a contract for the Special Operations Forces Global
Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) program, which is a competitive follow-on contract to SOF CLSS. MFC’s operating results included the following
(in millions):
  2017  2016  2015 
Net sales  $ 7,212  $ 6,608  $ 6,770 
Operating profit  1,053  1,018  1,282 
Operating margin  14.6% 15.4% 18.9%
Backlog at year-end  $ 17,863  $ 14,704  $ 15,463 
2017 compared to 2016
MFC’s net sales in 2017 increased $604 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was attributable to higher net sales of
approximately $250 million for tactical missile programs due to product configuration mix and increased deliveries (JASSM) and due to increased deliveries
for various other programs; about $210 million for air and missile defense programs due to contract mix on certain programs (primarily PAC-3) and increased
volume on certain programs (primarily THAAD); and about $110 million for fire control programs due to increased deliveries (primarily LANTIRN® and
SNIPER®).
MFC’s operating profit in 2017 increased $35 million, or 3%, compared to 2016. Operating profit increased about $70 million for air and missile defense
programs due to increased volume (primarily THAAD), contract mix (primarily PAC-3), a reserve recorded in fiscal year 2016 for a contractual matter that
did not recur in 2017, partially offset by lower risk retirements; and about
39
Table of Contents
$30 million for fire control programs due to increased deliveries (primarily LANTIRN® and SNIPER®). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of
approximately $65 million for tactical missile programs due to lower risk retirements (primarily JASSM and Hellfire) and the establishment of a reserve on a
program. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were about $80 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016.
2016 compared to 2015
MFC’s net sales in 2016 decreased $162 million, or 2%, compared to 2015. The decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately $205
million for air and missile defense programs due to decreased volume (primarily THAAD); and lower net sales of approximately $95 million due to lower
volume on various programs. These decreases were partially offset by a $75 million increase for tactical missiles programs due to increased deliveries
(primarily Hellfire); and approximately $70 million for fire control programs due to increased volume (SOF CLSS).
MFC’s operating profit in 2016 decreased $264 million, or 21%, compared to 2015. Operating profit decreased approximately $145 million for air and
missile defense programs due to lower risk retirements (PAC-3 and THAAD) and a reserve for a contractual matter; approximately $45 million for tactical
missiles programs due to lower risk retirements (Javelin); and approximately $45 million for fire control programs due to lower risk retirements (Apache) and
program mix. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and reserves, were about $225 million lower in 2016
compared to 2015.
Backlog
Backlog increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher orders on Hellfire, Precision Fires and PAC-3. Backlog decreased in 2016 compared
to 2015 primarily due to lower orders on PAC-3, Hellfire, and JASSM.
Rotary and Mission Systems
As previously described, on November 6, 2015, we acquired Sikorsky and aligned the Sikorsky business under our RMS business segment. The 2015
results of the acquired Sikorsky business have been included in our financial results from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through December 31, 2015.
As a result, our consolidated operating results and RMS business segment operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of
Sikorsky operations.
Our RMS business segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and commercial helicopters, ship and submarine
mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; the
Littoral Combat Ship (LCS); simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. In addition, RMS supports the needs of government
customers in cybersecurity and delivers communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions for defense applications.
RMS’ major programs include Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters, Aegis Combat System (Aegis), LCS, CH-53K development helicopter, VH-
92A helicopter program, Advanced Hawkeye Radar System, and The Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) contract.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we realigned certain programs within the RMS business segment to align with changes in management structure. RMS’
operating results included the following (in millions):
  2017  2016  2015 
Net sales  $ 14,215  $ 13,462  $ 9,091 
Operating profit  905  906  844 
Operating margin  6.4% 6.7% 9.3%
Backlog at year-end  $ 28,974  $ 28,430  $ 30,076 
2017 compared to 2016
RMS’ net sales in 2017 increased $753 million, or 6%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to approximately $680 million for
Sikorsky helicopter programs due to certain adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition and higher volume on certain helicopter
programs; and about $160 million for training and logistics services programs due to higher volume. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of
about $50 million for IWSS programs due to lower volume.
RMS’ operating profit in 2017 was comparable with 2016. Operating profit increased about $105 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to certain
adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition. This increase was offset by a decrease of $100 million for C4USS programs due to a net
$95 million increase for charges for performance matters on the EADGE-T contract and $20 million for IWSS programs primarily due to a performance
matter on the VLS program, partially offset by higher
40
Table of Contents
risk retirements (primarily LCS). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were about $55 million lower in 2017
compared to 2016.
2016 compared to 2015
RMS’ net sales in 2016 increased $4.4 billion, or 48%, compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately
$4.6 billion from Sikorsky helicopter programs, which was acquired on November 6, 2015. Net sales for 2015 include Sikorsky’s results subsequent to the
acquisition date, net of certain revenue adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business. This increase was partially offset by lower net
sales of approximately $115 million for IWSS programs due to decreased volume on various programs; and approximately $70 million for training and
logistics programs due to the divestiture of our LMCFT business, which reported sales through the May 2, 2016 divestiture date.
RMS’ operating profit in 2016 increased $62 million, or 7%, compared to 2015. Operating profit increased approximately $85 million for training and
logistics programs due primarily to the divestiture of our LMCFT business which generated operating losses through its May 2, 2016 divestiture date; about
$30 million for our IWSS programs due to investments made in connection with a next generation radar technology program awarded during 2015; and
approximately $55 million for C4USS programs due primarily to higher reserves for performance matters on an international program in 2015. These
increases were partially offset by a decrease of $70 million as a result of a higher operating loss from Sikorsky, inclusive of the unfavorable impacts of
intangible asset amortization and other adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business; and about $25 million for other matters.
Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and reserves, were about $155 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015.
Backlog
Backlog increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a new multi-year award at Sikorsky. Backlog decreased in 2016 compared to 2015
primarily due to sales being recognized on several multi-year programs (primarily in Sikorsky) related to prior year awards.
Space
Our Space business segment, previously known as Space Systems, is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of
satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates
complex space and ground-based global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also
responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space’s major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet
Ballistic Missile (FBM), AWE, Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion), Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS), Global Positioning System (GPS) III,
Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), and The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). Operating profit for our Space business segment includes
our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. Space’s operating results included the
following (in millions):
  2017  2016  2015 
Net sales  $ 9,473  $ 9,409  $ 9,105 
Operating profit  993  1,289  1,171 
Operating margin  10.5% 13.7% 12.9%
Backlog at year-end  $ 17,267  $ 18,842  $ 17,375 
2017 compared to 2016
Space’s net sales in 2017 increased $64 million, or 1%, compared to 2016. The increase was attributable to approximately $810 million due to a full year
of net sales from AWE in 2017 compared to four months of sales in 2016, which we began consolidating during the third quarter of 2016. This increase was
partially offset by a decrease of approximately $300 million for space transportation programs due to a reduction in launch-related events; about $255 million
for government satellite programs (primarily AEHF and SBIRS) due to lower volume; and approximately $190 million across other programs (including the
Orion program) due to lower volume.
Space’s operating profit in 2017 decreased $296 million, or 23%, compared to 2016. Operating profit decreased about $127 million due to the pre-tax
gain recorded in 2016 related to the consolidation of AWE; about $95 million for lower equity earnings from ULA; about $30 million for space transportation
programs due to a reduction in launch-related events; a net decrease of about $25 million related to charges recorded in 2017 for performance matters on
certain commercial satellite programs; and about $25 million for government satellite programs (primarily SBIRS and AEHF) due to a charge for
performance matters and

lower volume. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and changes in reserves, were about $20 million higher in
2017 compared to 2016.
2016 compared to 2015
Space’s net sales in 2016 increased $304 million, or 3%, compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to net sales of approximately $410 million
from AWE following the consolidation of this business in the third quarter of 2016; and approximately $150 million for commercial space transportation
programs due to increased launch-related activities; and approximately $70 million of higher net sales for various programs (primarily FBM) due to increased
volume. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of approximately $340 million for government satellite programs due to decreased
volume (primarily SBIRS and MUOS) and the wind-down or completion of mission solutions programs.
Space’s operating profit in 2016 increased $118 million, or 10%, compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a non-cash, pre-tax gain of
approximately $127 million related to the consolidation of AWE; and approximately $80 million of increased equity earnings from joint ventures (primarily
ULA). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $105 million for government satellite programs due to lower risk retirements
(primarily SBIRS, MUOS and mission solutions programs) and decreased volume. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate
adjustments, were approximately $185 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015.
Equity earnings
Total equity earnings recognized by Space (primarily ULA) represented approximately $205 million, $325 million and $245 million, or 21%, 25% and
21% of this business segment’s operating profit during 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Backlog
Backlog decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower orders for government satellite programs, partially offset by higher orders on the
Orion program. Backlog increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the addition of AWE’s backlog.
Liquidity and Cash Flows
We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when
they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business, including capital expenditures, independent research and development
and made selective business acquisitions, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, and managing our debt levels,
maturities and interest rates.
We have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, capital expenditures, debt service and
repayments, dividends, share repurchases and postretirement benefit plan contributions. Our strong operating cash flows enabled our Board of Directors to
approve two key cash deployment initiatives in September 2017. First, we increased our fourth quarter dividend rate by 10% to $2.00 per share. Second, the
Board of Directors approved a $2.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future
common share repurchases under our program was $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2017.
During 2016, we received a one-time, tax-free special cash payment of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of the divestiture of the IS&GS business in
the third quarter of 2016. We used the proceeds to repay $500 million of long-term notes at their scheduled maturity and paid $484 million in dividends with a
portion of this cash. The remainder was used for share repurchases.
We have accessed the capital markets opportunistically as we did in February 2015 when we issued $2.25 billion of long-term debt and as needed as we
did in November 2015 when we issued $7.0 billion of long-term debt in connection with our acquisition of Sikorsky. We also used a combination of short-
term debt financing, commercial paper and available cash to fund the Sikorsky acquisition, as discussed below in “Capital Structure, Resources and Other”
and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to
support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. We also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general
corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, our revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper and letters of credit to support customer
advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. See our “Capital Structure, Resources
and Other” section below for a discussion on financial resources available to us.
We will make contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. As a
result of these contributions, we do not expect any material qualified defined benefit cash funding
42
Table of Contents
will be required until 2021. We plan to fund these contributions and manage the timing of cash flows in 2018 using a mix of cash on hand and commercial
paper. While we do not anticipate a need to do so, our capital structure and resources would allow us to issue new debt if circumstances change.
Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source
of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund customer programs
ourselves pending government appropriations and are doing so with increased frequency. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we
may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs.
Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash
more frequently under cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts, which together represents approximately 37% of the sales we recorded in 2017, as
we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments,
which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are
encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance,
thereby affecting our cash flows.
The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts,
rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a
percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. While the total amount of cash collected on a contract is the same,
performance-based payments have had a more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flows. In addition, our cash flows may be affected if the U.S.
Government decides to withhold payments on our billings. While the impact of withholding payments delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of
cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary.
The majority of our capital expenditures for 2017 and those planned for 2018 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology.
Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For
example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support higher production of the F-35 combat
aircraft, and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support
programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.
The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions):
  2017 2016 2015
Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year  $ 1,837 $ 1,090 $ 1,446

Cash and cash equivalents at end of year  $ 2,861 $ 1,837 $ 1,090
Operating Activities
2017 compared to 2016
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in cash used for working capital, a
reduction in cash paid for income taxes and a reduction in cash paid for severance. The change in working capital is defined as receivables and inventories
less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. The change in working capital was largely driven by timing of cash
receipts for accounts receivable (primarily PAC-3, THAAD, LANTIRN® and SNIPER®, and Sikorsky helicopter programs) and lower inventory. We made
net income tax
43
Table of Contents
payments of $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments in years
after 2017 are expected to benefit materially from the enactment of the Tax Act. We made interest payments of approximately $610 million and
approximately $600 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. In addition, cash provided by operating activities during the year ended
December 31, 2016 included cash generated by IS&GS of approximately $310 million as we retained this cash as part of the divestiture. We will make
contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018. For discussion of future postretirement benefit plan funding, see “Critical
Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans” (under the caption “Funding Considerations”).
2016 compared to 2015
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $88 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a reduction in cash paid for income taxes,
partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest expense and an increase in cash used for working capital. The $196 million increase in cash flows used
for working capital (defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) was
attributable to timing of cash receipts for receivables (primarily F-35 program), partially offset by timing of production and billing cycles affecting customer
advances and progress payments applied to inventories (primarily C-130 program). We made net income tax payments of $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion during
the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We made interest payments of approximately $600 million and $375 million during the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015
included cash generated by IS&GS of approximately $310 million and approximately $500 million as we retained this cash as part of the divestiture.
Investing Activities
Net cash used for investing activities increased $162 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher capital expenditures and cash proceeds
received in the prior year related to properties sold. Net cash used for investing activities decreased $8.7 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to
$9.0 billion of cash used for acquisition activities in 2015 that did not recur in 2016. Acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and
investments in affiliates. We had no significant cash acquisitions in 2017 and 2016. In 2015, we paid $9.0 billion for the Sikorsky acquisition, net of cash
acquired (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
Capital expenditures amounted to $1.2 billion in 2017, $1.1 billion in 2016 and $939 million in 2015. The majority of our capital expenditures were for
equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur
capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the
development or purchase of internal-use-software.
Additionally, in 2015, we received cash proceeds of approximately $165 million related to three properties sold in California.
Financing Activities
Net cash used for financing activities increased $848 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the receipt of a one-time special cash payment in
2016 from the divestiture of the IS&GS business and higher dividend payments in 2017, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt in 2016 and a
reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock.
Net cash used for financing activities increased $7.7 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in
2015 which did not recur in 2016, the repayments of long-term debt in 2016, and higher dividend payments, partially offset by the proceeds from the one-time
special cash payment of $1.8 billion from the divestiture of the IS&GS business and a reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock.
In May 2016, we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities. In September 2016,
we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities.
In February 2015, we received net proceeds of $2.21 billion for the issuance of $2.25 billion of fixed interest-rate long-term notes. In November 2015,
we borrowed $7.0 billion of fixed interest-rate long-term notes and received net proceeds of $6.9 billion (the November 2015 Notes). These proceeds were
used to repay $6.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under a 364-day revolving credit facility that was used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the
Sikorsky acquisition. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2015, to partially finance the Sikorsky acquisition we borrowed and repaid approximately $1.0
billion under our commercial paper program.
For additional information about our debt financing activities see the “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt”
included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents
We paid dividends totaling $2.2 billion ($7.46 per share) in 2017, $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share) in 2016 and $1.9 billion ($6.15 per share) in 2015. We
paid quarterly dividends of $1.82 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2017 and $2.00 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017; $1.65 per
share during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and $1.82 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016; and $1.50 per share during each of the first three
quarters of 2015 and $1.65 per share during the fourth quarter of 2015.
We paid $2.0 billion, $2.1 billion and $3.1 billion to repurchase 7.1 million, 8.9 million and 15.2 million shares of our common stock during 2017, 2016
and 2015.
Cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with employee stock option exercises during 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled
$71 million, $106 million and $174 million. The exercises resulted in the issuance of 0.8 million, 1.2 million and 2.2 million shares of our common stock.
Capital Structure, Resources and Other
At December 31, 2017, we held cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $580 million of our cash and cash
equivalents was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. Those balances are generally available to fund ordinary business operations without legal or
other restrictions and a significant portion could be immediately available to fund U.S. operations upon repatriation. While our investment in our foreign
subsidiaries continues to be permanent in duration, in light of our decision to accelerate contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, earnings from
certain foreign subsidiaries may be repatriated.
Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, amounted to $14.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and mainly is in the form of
publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit
agreements.
We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We
review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance
existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.
On occasion, our customers may seek deferred payment terms to purchase our products. In connection with these transactions, we may, at our customer’s
request, enter into arrangements for the non-recourse sale of customer receivables to unrelated third–party financial institutions. For accounting purposes,
these transactions are not discounted and are treated as a sale of receivables as we have no continuing involvement. The sale proceeds from the financial
institutions are reflected in our operating cash flows on the statement of cash flows. During 2017, we sold approximately $698 million of customer
receivables. There were no gains or losses related to sales of these receivables.
Revolving Credit Facilities
On October 9, 2015, we entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year Facility) with various banks. The 5‑year Facility was amended in
October 2017 to extend its expiration date by one year from October 9, 2021 to October 9, 2022. The 5‑year Facility is available for general corporate
purposes. The undrawn portion of the 5-year Facility is also available to serve as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. We may request and
the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase in the borrowing capacity under the 5-year Facility of up to an additional $500 million. There were no
borrowings outstanding under the 5-year Facility as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Borrowings under the 5-year Facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the
5-year Facility’s agreement. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the 5-year Facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various
representations, warranties, and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant
not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5‑year Facility agreement.
Long-Term Debt
In September 2017, we issued notes totaling approximately $1.6 billion with a fixed interest rate of 4.09% maturing in September 2052 (the New Notes)
in exchange for outstanding notes totaling approximately $1.4 billion with fixed interest rates ranging from 4.70% to 8.50% maturing 2029 to 2046 (the Old
Notes). In connection with the exchange of principal, we paid a premium of $237 million, substantially all of which was in the form of New Notes. This
premium will be amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the New Notes using the effective interest method. We may, at our option, redeem
some or all of the New Notes at any time by paying the principal amount of notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued
45
Table of Contents
and unpaid interest. Interest on the New Notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2018. The New Notes are
unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
In September 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. In May 2016,
we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities. We also had related variable interest rate
swaps with a notional amount of $450 million mature, which did not have a significant impact on net earnings or comprehensive income.
In November 2015, we issued $7.0 billion of notes (the November 2015 Notes) in a registered public offering with fixed rates ranging from 1.85% to
4.70% and maturing 2018 to 2046. We received net proceeds of $6.9 billion from the offering, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, which are
being amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt. The proceeds of the November 2015 Notes were used to repay $6.0 billion of borrowings under
our 364-day Facility and for general corporate purposes.
In February 2015, we issued $2.25 billion of notes (the February 2015 Notes) in a registered public offering with fixed rates ranging from 2.90% to
3.80% and maturing 2025 to 2045. We received net proceeds of $2.21 billion from the offering, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, which are
being amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt. The proceeds of the February 2015 Notes were used for general corporate purposes.
We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the issuance of
an indeterminate amount of debt securities.
Commercial Paper
We have agreements in place with financial institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion 5-year Facility.
During 2017, we borrowed and fully repaid amounts under our commercial paper programs. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of
December 31, 2017. However, we may as conditions warrant issue commercial paper backed by our credit facility to manage the timing of cash flows and to
fund a portion of our defined benefit pension contributions of approximately $5.0 billion in 2018.
Total Equity
Our total deficit was $609 million at December 31, 2017 compared to equity of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease in equity was primarily
due to the estimated impact of the Tax Act, which resulted in a net one-time tax charge of $1.9 billion, the annual December 31 re-measurement adjustment
related to our postretirement benefit plans of $1.4 billion, the repurchase of 7.1 million common shares for $2.0 billion; and dividends declared of $2.2 billion
during the year. These decreases were partially offset by net earnings of $2.0 billion, which includes the $1.9 billion net tax charge, recognition of previously
deferred postretirement benefit plan amounts of $802 million, and employee stock activity of $400 million (including the impacts of stock option exercises,
ESOP activity and stock-based compensation).
As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over
par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. If additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we record the remainder of the excess purchase
price over par value as a reduction of retained earnings. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in
capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $1.6 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in
2017.

Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2017, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to
purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and
commitments are as follows (in millions):

(a) Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only and excludes approximately $10 million of debt issued by a consolidated joint venture, for which the debt is
not guaranteed by us.
The table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for our qualified defined benefit pension plans. For additional information about our
future minimum contributions for these plans, see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2017. Such amounts
mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans.
Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or
nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related
to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table
include approximately $37.3 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers.
The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related
contracts “for convenience” under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform
subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with
foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts
with commercial customers.
Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include facilities infrastructure, equipment and information technology.
We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products
and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign
country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use
cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g.,
our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies
from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities
for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately
applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the
original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may
impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations
is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our
business activities. At December 31, 2017, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $13.4
billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments, most of which extend through 2044. To the extent we have entered into
purchase or other obligations at December 31, 2017 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs
usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2017, in the
47

event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset
requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments.
In connection with our 50% ownership interest of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) are required to provide ULA an additional capital
contribution if ULA is unable to make required payments under its inventory supply agreement with Boeing. As of December 31, 2017, ULA’s total
remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agreement was $120 million. The parties have agreed to defer the remaining payment obligation,
as it is more than offset by other commitments to ULA. Accordingly, we do not expect to be required to make a capital contribution to ULA under this
agreement.
In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other for guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA
under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2017, and that it
will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities or guarantees.
We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions and other directly issued guarantees to third
parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds
generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as
venture partners. At December 31, 2017, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions):

Total commitments  $ 3,305 $ 1,333 $ 1,073 $ 463 $ 436
(a) Approximately $640 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category , $473 million in the “Years 2 and 3” category and $277 million in the “Years 4
and 5” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.
At December 31, 2017, third-party guarantees totaled $750 million, of which approximately 62% related to guarantees of contractual performance of
ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon
the contractual non-performance of the venture, venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable
us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a venture partner.
In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current
and former venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. There were no material
amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.
Critical Accounting Policies
Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition
Substantially all of our net sales are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method, which requires that significant estimates and assumptions
be made in accounting for the contracts. Our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we
account for under a services accounting model.
We evaluate new or significantly modified contracts with customers other than the U.S. Government, to the extent the contracts include multiple
elements, to determine if the individual deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting. When we determine that accounting for the
deliverables as separate units is appropriate, we allocate the contract value to the deliverables based on their relative estimated selling prices. The contracts or
contract modifications we evaluate for multiple elements typically are long-term in nature and include the provision of both products and services. Based on
the nature of our business, we generally account for components of such contracts using the percentage-of-completion accounting model or the services
accounting model, as appropriate.
48
Table of Contents
We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the underlying contract.
Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to international governments
contracted through the U.S. Government.
Contract Types
Our contracts generally record sales for both products and services under fixed-price, cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts.
Fixed-price contracts
Under fixed-price contracts, which accounted for about 63%, 61%, and 57% of our total net sales in 2017, 2016, and 2015, we agree to perform the
specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more
or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur
financial penalties based on our performance.
Cost-reimbursable contracts
Cost-reimbursable contracts, which accounted for about 37%, 38%, and 42% of our total net sales in 2017, 2016, and 2015, provide for the payment of
allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee, up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. We generate revenue under
two general types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee/incentive-fee contracts, which represent a substantial majority of our cost-reimbursable
contracts; and cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.
Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against
a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for
reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (incentive based on
cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (incentive based on performance). The fixed fee in a cost-plus-fixed-
fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs.
Percentage-of-Completion Method
We record net sales and estimated profits for substantially all of our contracts using the percentage-of-completion method for fixed-price and cost-
reimbursable contracts for products and services with the U.S. Government.
The percentage-of-completion method for product contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract. For example, for contracts
that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and/or to deliver minimal quantities, sales
are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales and an
estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. For contracts that require us to provide a
substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and an estimated profit on a percentage-of-completion basis
using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. For contracts to provide services to the U.S. Government, sales are
generally recorded using the cost-to-cost method.
Award and incentive fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted
for under the percentage-of-completion method. Estimates of award fees are based on past experience and anticipated performance. We record incentives or
penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely
on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs.
Accounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs
(including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance) and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the
number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the
estimation of total sales and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and, accordingly, is subject to change. When adjustments in
estimated total contract sales or estimated total costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-
date effect of such changes.
Our estimates of costs at completion of the contract are based on assumptions we make for variables such as labor productivity and availability, the
complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for
materials), performance by our subcontractors and the availability and
49
Table of Contents
timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total sales to be
earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to
the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the
contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g.,
the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation
agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each
contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the
contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost
aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated
total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit
booking rate.
In addition, comparability of our business segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted by changes in profit booking rates on
our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk
retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a
particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or
decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and
margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost
recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual
matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions (such as those mentioned in “Note 15 – Restructuring Charges” included in our Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements), which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of
certain assets. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state
income taxes.
Services Method
Under fixed-price service contracts, we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the
costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss. We record net sales under fixed-price service contracts with non-U.S. Government
customers on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in
a different pattern. For cost-reimbursable contracts for services to non-U.S. Government customers, we record net sales as services are performed, except for
award and incentive fees. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable, generally at the date the amount is communicated to us
by the customer. This approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals (typically every six months) throughout the contract and is
dependent on the customer’s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications. Costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred.
Other Contract Accounting Considerations
The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S.
Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for
goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain
advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements
with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the
environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and
administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.
We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and
allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit
Agency.

New Accounting Pronouncement
On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (Topic 606) (commonly referred to as ASC
606), which will change the way we recognize revenue and significantly expand the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. We adopted the
requirements of the new standard on the effective date of January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective transition method, whereby ASC 606 will be applied to
each prior year presented and the cumulative effect of applying ASC 606 will be recognized at January 1, 2016, the beginning of the earliest year presented.
For additional information regarding our adoption of ASC 606, see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”).
Postretirement Benefit Plans
Overview
Many of our employees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other
postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life
insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability
on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation
of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on
past service.
In June 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees; comprising the majority of
our benefit obligations; to freeze future retirement benefits. The calculation of retirement benefits under the affected defined benefit pension plans is
determined by a formula that takes into account the participants’ years of credited service and average compensation. The freeze will take effect in two stages.
On January 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen so that future pay increases, annual incentive
bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after December 31, 2015 are not used to calculate retirement benefits. On January 1, 2020, the
service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited
service for any period after December 31, 2019. When the freeze is complete, the majority of our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced
defined contribution retirement savings plan.
Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the
funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as
changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including
participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.
Actuarial Assumptions
The plan assets and benefit obligations are measured at the end of each year or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a
significant plan amendment, settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key
assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, employee turnover and the health care cost
trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the
calculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make
judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to
plan participants.
We continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit
pension plans resulting in 3.625% at December 31, 2017, compared to 4.125% at December 31, 2016 and 4.375% at December 31, 2015. We utilized a single
weighted average discount rate of 3.625% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31,
2017, compared to 4.00% at December 31, 2016 and 4.25% at December 31, 2015. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single
weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over
the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected
postretirement benefit plan cash flows.
51
Table of Contents
We utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.50% at both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 as compared to 8.00% at
December 31, 2015. We reduced our expected long-term rate of return assumption in 2016 due to downward pressure on the equity and fixed income asset
classes in our trust. An increasingly aging population and debt burden place downward pressure on already low interest rates and economic growth;
suggesting the future return for our fixed-income may be lower than historical norms. Surges in equities since 2009 have led to a high valuation of the equity
markets, suggesting the forward return may also be lower than historical norms. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term
rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several
factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses
and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual
return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods.
Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be
approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of
variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes
in the discount rate.
In both October 2017 and 2016, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies. We used the revised
assumptions indicating a shortened longevity in our December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 re-measurements of benefit obligation. The publications
were a refinement to assumptions the Society of Actuaries published in previous years, beginning in 2014.
Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $12.6 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement
benefit plans. The cumulative non-cash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates, investment
losses and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used
to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor
method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over the average future
service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately nine years as of December 31, 2017. This amortization period is
expected to extend (approximately double) in 2020 when our non-union pension plans are completely frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of
the participants instead of average future service. During 2017, $802 million of these amounts was recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans
expense and about $1.2 billion is expected to be recognized as expense in 2018.
The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment.
A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 3.625% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2017, with all other assumptions held constant, would
have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2017 by approximately $1.5 billion, which
would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.2 billion. If the 3.625% discount rate at
December 31, 2017 that was used to compute the expected 2018 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis
points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2018 would be lower or higher by
approximately $115 million. If the 7.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2017 that was used to compute the
expected 2018 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held
constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2018 would be lower or higher by approximately $85 million. Each year, differences between the
actual plan asset return and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year’s FAS expense. Every 100
basis points difference in return during 2017 between our actual rate of return of approximately 13.00% and our expected long-term rate of return of 7.50%
impacted 2018 expected FAS pension expense by approximately $20 million.
Funding Considerations
There were no material contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Funding of our qualified defined benefit
pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as
amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined under the PPA.
The ERISA funded status is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP. As a result of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012
(MAP-21), which included a provision that changed the methodology for calculating the interest rate assumption used in determining the minimum funding
requirements under the PPA, there was an increase in the interest rate assumption, which in turn lowered the minimum funding requirements. On August 8,
2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA) was enacted; and on November 2, 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015; which
extend the methodology put in place by MAP-21 to calculate the
52
Table of Contents
interest rate assumption so that the impact will begin to decrease in 2021 and phase out by 2024. This has the effect of lowering our minimum funding
requirements during the affected periods from what they otherwise would have been. The ERISA funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans
was about 83% and 86% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The GAAP funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was about 68% and 70%
at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government
contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and
recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. We recovered $2.2 billion in 2017, $2.0 billion in 2016, and $1.6 billion in 2015 as
CAS pension costs. Effective February 27, 2012, CAS rules were revised to better align the recovery of pension costs, including prepayment credits, on U.S.
Government contracts with the minimum funding requirements of the PPA (referred to as CAS Harmonization). Specifically, CAS Harmonization shortened
the amortization period for allocating gains and losses to U.S. Government contracts from 15 to 10 years and requires the use of an interest rate to determine
CAS pension cost consistent with the interest rate used to determine minimum pension funding requirements under the PPA. While the change in the
amortization period was applicable beginning in 2013, there was a transition period for the impact of the change in the CAS liability measurement due to the
revised interest rate that was phased in with the full impact occurring in 2017. The incremental impact of CAS Harmonization increased successively through
2017, primarily due to the liability measurement transition period included in the amended rule. The enactment of the HATFA and Bipartisan Budget Act of
2015 also increased the interest rate assumption used to determine our CAS pension costs, which has the effect of lowering the recovery of pension
contributions during the affected periods as it decreases our CAS pension costs.
Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made under the PPA. Amounts contributed in excess
of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. As of December 31,
2017, our prepayment credits were approximately $6.3 billion as compared to $7.7 billion at December 31, 2016. The recovery of CAS pension costs under
U.S. Government contracts in excess of our contributions reduces the prepayment credit balance. The prepayment credit balance will also increase or decrease
based on our actual investment return on plan assets.
Trends
We will make contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. As a
result of these contributions, we do not expect any material qualified defined benefit cash funding will be required until 2021. We plan to fund these
contributions using a mix of cash on hand and commercial paper. While we do not anticipate a need to do so, our capital structure and resources would allow
us to issue new debt if circumstances change (see our “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” discussion above). We anticipate recovering approximately
$2.4 billion of CAS pension cost in 2018.
We expect our 2018 FAS pension expense to be $1.4 billion; comparable to our 2017 FAS pension expense of $1.4 billion. The impact of the lower FAS
discount rate of 3.625% for 2018 versus 4.125% for 2017 was mostly offset by our actual rate of investment return in 2017 of approximately 13.00% versus
our expected long-term rate of return of 7.50%, shortened longevity assumptions, and 2018 cash contributions of $5.0 billion versus immaterial cash
contributions in 2017. We expect a FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2018 of about $1.0 billion, as compared to $876 million in 2017, due to higher 2018 CAS
pension costs as compared to 2017.
Environmental Matters
We are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where
we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our consolidated
balance sheet for environmental matters was $920 million and $1.0 billion. We have recorded receivables totaling $799 million and $870 million at
December 31, 2017 and 2016 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies
of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to not be
recoverable under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.
We enter into agreements (e.g., administrative consent orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental
remediation obligations. We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify
the extent and timing of our obligations. Environmental cleanup activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due
to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on
natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving environmental standards.
53
Table of Contents
We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting
Policies” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the
above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities, which results in the
calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash
payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts
could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our
estimate of the extent of contamination).
Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as
general and administrative costs. Under existing U.S. Government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government
business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result,
most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the
contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other
factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and recent
efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.
In addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, California previously established a maximum level of the contaminant
hexavalent chromium in drinking water of 10 parts per billion (ppb). Recently, this standard was successfully challenged by the California Manufacturers and
Technology Association (CMTA) for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis. In response to the court’s ruling, the State Water Resources
Control Board (State Board), a branch of the California Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published
regulations, leaving only the 50 ppb standard for total chromium. The State Board has indicated it will work to re-establish a hexavalent chromium standard.
If the standard for hexavalent chromium is re-established at 10 ppb or above, it will not have a material impact on our existing remediation costs in California.
Further, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.
California is also reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate, and the U.S. EPA is taking steps to regulate perchlorate in
drinking water. If substantially lower standards are adopted, in either California or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium, we expect a
material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery
in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is
determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular
interim reporting period.
As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our
environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental receivable and a charge to earnings. For example, if we
were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million,
with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the
U.S. Government.
We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former
operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at
this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the
contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a
particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable
with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.
If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be
shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree
among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible
parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were
required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the
other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from
other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation.

Goodwill
As disclosed in “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting
Pronouncements”), at the beginning of the quarter ended September 24, 2017, we adopted the amendments in ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and
Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which eliminates the requirement to compare the implied fair value of reporting unit
goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill (commonly referred to as Step 2) from the goodwill impairment test and requires entities to only compare
the fair value of the reporting unit to the reporting units’ carrying amount to determine goodwill impairment. We elected to adopt the new standard at the
beginning of the third quarter of 2017 because it significantly simplifies the evaluation of goodwill for impairment and we have updated our critical
accounting policy for goodwill to reflect the adoption of the new standard.
The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses.
Our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the
fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or
changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in
our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal
of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our
business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the
operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management
regularly reviews the operating results.
We may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative
approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment.
Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further
evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three
years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.
To perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a
reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds
its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a
combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and
values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of
expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction
multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such
as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in
working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective
reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and
represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The
carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business
segment and corporate levels.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units utilizing the statutory tax rate in effect at
the time of the test. The results of that test indicated that for each of our reporting units, including Sikorsky, no impairment existed. As of December 31, 2017,
the carrying value of our Sikorsky reporting unit includes goodwill of $2.7 billion and exceeds its fair value by a margin of approximately 25%, after
adjusting for the positive impact of lower statutory tax rates due to the passage of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. We acquired Sikorsky in November
2015 and recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. As a result, the carrying value and fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit
continue to be closely aligned. Therefore, any business deterioration, changes in timing of orders, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes
in market factors could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections. Similarly, market factors utilized in the impairment
analysis, including long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and transaction multiples, could
negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill at our Sikorsky
reporting unit
55
Table of Contents
is at risk for impairment should there be deterioration of projected cash flows, negative changes in market factors or a significant increase in the carrying
value of the reporting unit.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we realigned certain programs within the RMS business segment to align with changes in management structure. We
performed goodwill impairment tests prior and subsequent to the realignment, and there was no indication of goodwill impairment.
Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many
variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a
material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and consist of customer programs,
trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired
businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated
program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value, which ranges from nine to 20 years.
Acquired intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This testing compares carrying value to
fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the
applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future
net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be
impaired. Should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted
future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. Should the asset group’s carrying
amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net
earnings.
The carrying value of our Sikorsky business includes an indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset of $887 million as of December 31, 2017. In the
fourth quarter of 2017, we performed the annual impairment test for the Sikorsky indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset utilizing the statutory tax rate in
effect at the time of the test and the results indicated that no impairment existed. At December 31, 2017, the Sikorsky trademark exceeded its carrying value
by a margin of approximately 20%, after adjusting for the positive impact of lower statutory tax rates due to the passage of the Tax Act on December 22,
2017. Additionally, our Sikorsky business has finite-lived customer program intangible assets with carrying values of $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2017.
As discussed above in the Goodwill section, the carrying value and fair value of Sikorsky’s intangible assets continue to be closely aligned due to the
November 2015 acquisition of Sikorsky. Therefore, any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors
could cause our sales to decline below current projections. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that our Sikorsky intangible
assets are at risk for impairment should there be any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting
Pronouncements”).
ITEM  7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with
sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and
actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring
availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.
Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial
instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was
$16.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and the outstanding principal amount was $15.5 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of
$1.2 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2017.
56
Table of Contents
We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We
do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with
changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign
currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the
Australian dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated
with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest
rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate
borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to LIBOR in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For
variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate
the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not
designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.
The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its
resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings
and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the
hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges, or of
derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our
outstanding interest rate swaps at both December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1.2 billion. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency
hedges at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $4.1 billion and $4.0 billion. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the net fair value of our derivative instruments
was not material (see “Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate
movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial
statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contract to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions we believe that any
movement on our foreign currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create
material risk.
We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable
credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. We periodically
monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2017,
investments in the trust totaled $1.4 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds
investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the
liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and
certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the
change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other
unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP,
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,
on the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Lockheed Martin Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lockheed Martin Corporation (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016,
and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2017. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Corporation as of
December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 6, 2018 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Lockheed Martin Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies
Organization – We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and
sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific,
logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil
and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government.
Basis of presentation – Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest entities if we are the
primary beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. Our receivables, inventories, customer advances and amounts in
excess of costs incurred and certain amounts in other current liabilities primarily are attributable to long-term contracts or programs in progress for which the
related operating cycles are longer than one year. In accordance with industry practice, we include these items in current assets and current liabilities. Unless
otherwise noted, we present all per share amounts cited in these consolidated financial statements on a “per diluted share” basis. Certain prior period amounts
have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.
The discussion and presentation of the operating results of our business segments have been impacted by the following recent events.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the business segment formally known as Space Systems was renamed Space. There was no change to the composition
of the portfolio in connection with the name change. The information for this segment for all periods included in these consolidated financial statements has
been labeled using the new name.
On August 16, 2016, we completed the divestiture of the Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business, which merged with a subsidiary of
Leidos Holdings, Inc. (Leidos) in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Accordingly, the operating results of the IS&GS business have been classified as
discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of earnings for all prior periods presented. However, the cash flows of the IS&GS business have not
been reclassified in our consolidated statements of cash flows as we retained the cash as part of the Transaction. See “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures”
for additional information about the divestiture of the IS&GS business.
On August 24, 2016, we increased our ownership interest in the AWE Management Limited (AWE) joint venture, which operates the United Kingdom’s
nuclear deterrent program, from 33% to 51%. At which time, we began consolidating AWE. Consequently, our operating results include 100% of AWE’s
sales and 51% of its operating profit. Prior to increasing our ownership interest, we accounted for our investment in AWE using the equity method of
accounting. Under the equity method, we recognized only 33% of AWE’s earnings or losses and no sales. Accordingly, prior to August 24, 2016, the date we
obtained control, we recorded 33% of AWE’s net earnings in our operating results and subsequent to August 24, 2016, we recognized 100% of AWE’s sales
and 51% of its operating profit. See “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” for additional information about the change in ownership of AWE.
On November 6, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and certain affiliated companies (collectively “Sikorsky”) for $9.0
billion, net of cash acquired, and aligned Sikorsky under our Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business segment. The operating results and cash flows of
Sikorsky have been included on our consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of cash flows since the November 6, 2015 acquisition
date. Additionally, the assets and liabilities of Sikorsky are included in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. See
“Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures” for additional information about the acquisition of Sikorsky and related final purchase accounting.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we realigned certain programs among our business segments. The amounts, discussion and presentation of our
business segments for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements reflect the program realignment.
Use of estimates – We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In doing
so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We
base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results
may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not
limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition, postretirement benefit plans, environmental receivables and
64
Table of Contents
liabilities, evaluation of goodwill and other assets for impairment, income taxes including deferred tax assets, fair value measurements and contingencies.
Sales and earnings – We record net sales and estimated profits for substantially all of our contracts using the percentage-of-completion method for
fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts for products and services with the U.S. Government. Sales are recorded on all time-and-materials contracts as the
work is performed based on agreed-upon hourly rates and allowable costs. We account for our services contracts with non-U.S. Government customers using
the services method of accounting. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the attributes of the
underlying contracts.
Percentage-of-Completion Method – The percentage-of-completion method for product contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under
the contract. For example, for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract
and/or to deliver minimal quantities, sales are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method
of accounting, we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. For
contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and an estimated profit
on a percentage-of-completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. For contracts to provide services
to the U.S. Government, sales are generally recorded using the cost-to-cost method.
Award and incentive fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted
for under the percentage-of-completion method. Estimates of award fees are based on past experience and anticipated performance. We record incentives or
penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely
on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs.
Accounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs
(including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance) and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the
number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the
estimation of total sales and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and, accordingly, is subject to change. When adjustments in
estimated total contract sales or estimated total costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-
date effect of such changes. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total sales to be earned, a provision for the entire
loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to
the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the
contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g.,
the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation
agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each
contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the
contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost
aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated
total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit
booking rate.
In addition, comparability of our business segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted by changes in profit booking rates on
our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk
retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a
particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or
decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and
margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost
recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual
matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions (such as those mentioned below in “Note 15 – Restructuring Charges”), which are
excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. Segment operating profit and items
such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes.

Changes in Estimates – As previously disclosed, we have a program to design, integrate, and install an air missile defense C4I systems for an
international customer that has experienced performance issues and for which we have periodically accrued reserves. In 2017, we revised our estimated costs
to complete the program, EADGE-T, as a consequence of ongoing performance matters and recorded an additional charge of $120 million ($74 million or
$0.25 per share, after tax) at our RMS business segment. As of December 31, 2017, cumulative losses, including reserves, remained at approximately
$260 million on this program. We are continuing to monitor the viability of the program and the available options and could record additional charges in
future periods. However, based on the reserves already accrued and our current estimate of the costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate
that additional charges, if any, would be material.
We have two commercial satellite programs at our Space business segment, for which we have experienced performance issues related to the
development and integration of a modernized LM 2100 satellite platform. These commercial programs require the development of new satellite technology to
enhance the LM 2100’s power, propulsion and electronics, among other items. The enhanced satellite is expected to benefit other commercial and government
satellite programs. We have periodically revised our estimated costs to complete these developmental commercial programs. We have recorded cumulative
losses of approximately $305 million as of December 31, 2017, including approximately $135 million ($83 million or $0.29 per share, after tax) recorded
during the year ended December 31, 2017. While these losses reflect our estimated total losses on the programs, we will continue to incur unrecovered costs
each period until we complete these programs and may have to record additional loss reserves in future periods, which could be material to our operating
results. While we do not currently anticipate recording additional loss reserves, the programs remain developmental and further challenges in the delivery and
integration of new satellite technology, anomalies discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework, further schedule delays and potential penalties
could require that we record additional reserves. We do not currently expect to be able to meet the delivery schedule under the contracts and have informed
the customers. The customers could seek to exercise a termination right under the contracts, in which case we would have to refund the payments we have
received and pay certain penalties. However, we think the probability that the customers will seek to exercise any termination right is remote as the delay
beyond the termination date is modest and the customers have an immediate need for the satellites.
Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, net of state income taxes,
increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.5 billion in both 2017 and 2016 and $1.7 billion in 2015. These adjustments increased net earnings by
approximately $980 million ($3.37 per share) in 2017, $950 million ($3.13 per share) in 2016 and $1.1 billion ($3.50 per share) in 2015.
Services Method – Under fixed-price service contracts, we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full
responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss. We record net sales under fixed-price service contracts with non-U.S.
Government customers on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations
are fulfilled in a different pattern. For cost-reimbursable contracts for services to non-U.S. Government customers, we record net sales as services are
performed, except for award and incentive fees. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable, generally at the date the amount
is communicated to us by the customer. This approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals (typically every six months) throughout
the contract and is dependent on the customer’s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications. Costs for all service contracts are
expensed as incurred.
Research and development and similar costs – Except for certain arrangements described below, we account for independent research and
development costs as part of the general and administrative costs that are allocated among all of our contracts and programs in progress under U.S.
Government contractual arrangements and charged to cost of sales. Under certain arrangements in which a customer shares in product development costs, our
portion of unreimbursed costs is expensed as incurred in cost of sales. Independent research and development costs charged to cost of sales totaled $1.2
billion in 2017, $988 million in 2016 and $817 million in 2015. Costs we incur under customer-sponsored research and development programs pursuant to
contracts are included in net sales and cost of sales.
Stock-based compensation – Compensation cost related to all share-based payments is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of
the award. We generally recognize the compensation cost ratably over a three-year vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. At each reporting date, the
number of shares is adjusted to the number ultimately expected to vest.
Income taxes – We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as from operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.

We periodically assess our tax exposures related to periods that are open to examination. Based on the latest available information, we evaluate our tax
positions to determine whether the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other taxing
authorities. If we cannot reach a more-likely-than-not determination, no benefit is recorded. If we determine that the tax position is more likely than not to be
sustained, we record the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled. We record interest and penalties
related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Interest and penalties were not material.
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash equivalents include highly liquid instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less.
Receivables – Receivables include amounts billed and currently due from customers and unbilled costs and accrued profits primarily related to sales on
long-term contracts that have been recognized but not yet billed to customers. Pursuant to contract provisions, agencies of the U.S. Government and certain
other customers have title to, or a security interest in, assets related to such contracts as a result of advances, performance-based payments and progress
payments. We reflect those advances and payments as an offset to the related receivables balance for contracts that we account for on a percentage-of-
completion basis using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion.
On occasion, our customers may seek deferred payment terms to purchase our products. In connection with these transactions, we may, at our customer’s
request, enter into arrangements for the non-recourse sale of customer receivables to unrelated third–party financial institutions. For accounting purposes,
these transactions are not discounted and are treated as a sale of receivables as we have no continuing involvement. The sale proceeds from the financial
institutions are reflected in our operating cash flows on the statement of cash flows. During 2017, we sold approximately $698 million of customer
receivables. There were no gains or losses related to sales of these receivables.
Inventories – We record inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Costs on long-term contracts and programs in progress
represent recoverable costs incurred for production or contract-specific facilities and equipment, allocable operating overhead, advances to suppliers and, in
the case of contracts with the U.S. Government and substantially all other governments, research and development and general and administrative expenses.
Pursuant to contract provisions, agencies of the U.S. Government and certain other customers have title to, or a security interest in, inventories related to such
contracts as a result of advances, performance-based payments and progress payments. We reflect those advances and payments as an offset against the
related inventory balances for contracts that we account for on a percentage-of-completion basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress
toward completing the contract. We determine the costs of other product and supply inventories by the first-in first-out or average cost methods.
Property, plant and equipment – We record property, plant and equipment at cost. We provide for depreciation and amortization on plant and
equipment generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets and the straight-line method thereafter. The
estimated useful lives of our plant and equipment generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for machinery and equipment. No
depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such assets are placed into operation. Depreciation expense related to plant and equipment
was $760 million in 2017, $747 million in 2016, and $716 million in 2015.
We review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets for impairment if events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. We assess impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the related asset grouping to its
carrying amount. If an asset is determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of
the asset and its carrying amount.
Capitalized software – We capitalize certain costs associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software. The amounts capitalized are
included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting
software, which ranges from two to six years. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, capitalized software totaled $424 million and $427 million, net of
accumulated amortization of $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion. No amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for its intended use. Amortization
expense related to capitalized software was $123 million in 2017, $136 million in 2016 and $161 million in 2015.
Goodwill – The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the
date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses.
Our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the
fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or
changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in
our market capitalization, operating performance indicators,
67
Table of Contents
competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been
allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment.
The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining
business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
We may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we
use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of
goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at
least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.
For the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting
unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair
value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a
combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and
values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of
expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction
multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such
as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in
working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective
reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and
represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The
carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business
segment and corporate levels.
During the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. The results of our annual
impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we realigned certain programs within the RMS business segment to align with changes in management structure. We
performed goodwill impairment tests prior and subsequent to the realignment, and there was no indication of goodwill impairment.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. During the fourth quarter of 2015,
we realigned certain programs between our business segments in connection with our strategic review of our government IT and technical services
businesses. As part of the realignment, goodwill was reallocated between affected reporting units on a relative fair value basis. We performed goodwill
impairment tests prior and subsequent to the realignment. The results of our 2015 annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed.
Intangible assets – Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and consist of
customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major
programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks
underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value, which
ranges from nine to 20 years. Acquired intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. This
testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. Finite-lived intangibles are
amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic
benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate their carrying value may be impaired.
Customer advances and amounts in excess of cost incurred – We receive advances, performance-based payments and progress payments from
customers that may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts, including contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government. We classify such advances, other
than those reflected as a reduction of receivables or inventories as discussed above, as current liabilities.
Postretirement benefit plans – Many of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans and we provide certain health care and life
insurance benefits to eligible retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). GAAP requires that the
68
Table of Contents
amounts we record related to our postretirement benefit plans be computed, based on service to date, using actuarial valuations that are based in part on
certain key economic assumptions we make, including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions
including participant longevity (also known as mortality), health care cost trend rates and employee turnover, each as appropriate based on the nature of the
plans.
A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of
deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These asset gains or losses, along with those resulting from adjustments to our benefit obligation, will be
amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit
obligations, over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately nine years as of December 31,
2017. This amortization period is expected to extend (approximately double) in 2020 when our non-union pension plan is frozen to use the average remaining
life expectancy of the participants instead of average future service.
We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset recorded within other
noncurrent assets or a liability recorded within noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status is measured as the
difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The funded status under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP.
Environmental matters – We record a liability for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the costs to be incurred for remediation at a particular site. We do not
discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Our environmental
liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets within other liabilities, both current and noncurrent. We expect to include a substantial portion of
environmental costs in our net sales and cost of sales in future periods pursuant to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. At the time a liability is
recorded for future environmental costs, we record a receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of products and
services to agencies of the U.S. Government, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continuously evaluate the
recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and
contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and recent efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.
We include the portion of those environmental costs expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts, or that is determined to not be
recoverable under U.S. Government contracts, in our cost of sales at the time the liability is established. Our environmental receivables are recorded on our
consolidated balance sheets within other assets, both current and noncurrent. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.
Investments in marketable securities – Investments in marketable securities consist of debt and equity securities and are classified as trading securities.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of our trading securities totaled $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion and was included in other noncurrent assets on
our consolidated balance sheets. Our trading securities are held in a separate trust, which includes investments to fund our deferred compensation plan
liabilities. Net gains on trading securities in 2017 and 2016 were $150 million and $66 million. Net losses on trading securities in 2015 were $11 million.
Gains and losses on these investments are included in other unallocated, net within cost of sales on our consolidated statements of earnings in order to align
the classification of changes in the market value of investments held for the plan with changes in the value of the corresponding plan liabilities.
Equity method investments – Investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for under the
equity method of accounting and are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Significant influence typically exists if we have a
20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. Under this method of accounting, our share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is included in
operating profit in other income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with the operations of
the business segment holding the investment. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other
than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. As of both December 31, 2017 and 2016, our equity method investments totaled $1.4
billion, which primarily are composed of our Space business segment’s investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA), see “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings,
Commitments and Contingencies”, and our Aeronautics and RMS business segments’ investments in the Advanced Military Maintenance, Repair and
Overhaul Center (AMMROC) venture. Our share of net earnings related to our equity method investees was $207 million in 2017, $443 million in 2016 and
$320 million in 2015, of which approximately $205 million, $325 million and $245 million related to our Space business segment.
69
Table of Contents
During the year ended December 31, 2017, equity earnings included a charge recorded in the first quarter of approximately $64 million ($40 million or
$0.14 per share, after tax), which represented our portion of a non-cash asset impairment related to certain long-lived assets held by our equity method
investee, AMMROC. We are continuing to monitor this investment. It is possible that we may have to record our portion of additional charges should their
business continue to experience performance issues, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Derivative financial instruments – We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are
subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that
change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in
our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also
are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate
swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. These swaps are designated as
fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings
in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative
instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.
We record derivatives at their fair value. The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our
intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of
hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated
other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the
ineffective portion of the hedges or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The
aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at both December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1.2 billion and the fair value was not significant.
The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $4.1 billion and $4.0 billion and the fair
value was not significant. Derivative instruments did not have a material impact on net earnings and comprehensive income during the years ended December
31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Substantially all of our derivatives are designated for hedge accounting. See “Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements” for more
information on the fair value measurements related to our derivative instruments.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, as amended (Topic 606) (commonly referred to as ASC 606), which will change the way we recognize revenue and significantly expand the
disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
We adopted the requirements of the new standard on January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective transition method, whereby ASC 606 will be applied to
each prior year presented and the cumulative effect of applying ASC 606 will be recognized at January 1, 2016, the beginning of the earliest year presented.
As ASC 606 supersedes substantially all existing revenue guidance affecting us under current GAAP, it will impact revenue and cost recognition across all of
our business segments, as well as our business processes and our information technology systems.
We commenced our evaluation of the impact of ASC 606 in late 2014, by evaluating its impact on selected contracts at each of our business segments.
With this baseline understanding, we developed a project plan to evaluate thousands of contracts across our business segments, develop processes and tools to
dual report financial results under both current GAAP and ASC 606 and assess the internal control structure in order to adopt ASC 606 on January 1, 2018.
We have periodically briefed our Audit Committee on our progress made towards adoption.
We currently recognize the majority of our revenue using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, whereby revenue is recognized as we
progress on the contract. For contracts with a significant amount of development and/or requiring the delivery of a minimal number of units, revenue and
profit are recognized using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress. For example, we use this method at our Aeronautics
business segment for the F-35 program; at our Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) business segment for the THAAD program; at our RMS business segment for
the Littoral Combat Ship and Aegis Combat System programs; and at our Space business segment for government satellite programs. For contracts that
70
Table of Contents
require us to produce a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we currently record revenue and profit using the
percentage-of-completion units-of-delivery method as the basis for measuring progress on the contract. For example, we use this method in Aeronautics for
the C-130J and C-5 programs; in MFC for tactical missile programs (e.g., Hellfire, JASSM), PAC-3 programs and fire control programs (e.g., LANTIRN®
and SNIPER®); in RMS for Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopter programs; and in Space for commercial satellite programs. For contracts to provide services
to the U.S. Government, revenue is generally recorded using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method.
Under ASC 606, revenue will be recognized as the customer obtains control of the goods and services promised in the contract (i.e., performance
obligations). Given the nature of our products and terms and conditions in our contracts, in particular those with the U.S. Government (including foreign
military sales (FMS) contracts), the customer obtains control as we perform work under the contract. Therefore, we expect to recognize revenue over time for
substantially all of our contracts using a method similar to our current percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Accordingly, adoption of ASC 606 will
primarily impact our contracts where revenue is currently recognized using the percentage-of-completion units-of-delivery method. As a result, we anticipate
recognizing revenue for these contracts earlier in the performance period as we incur costs, as opposed to when units are delivered. We may also have more
performance obligations in our contracts under ASC 606, which may impact the timing of recording sales and operating profit, including those where sales
recognition is deferred pending the incurrence of costs.
During the third quarter of 2017, we completed our preliminary assessment of the cumulative effect of adopting ASC 606 on our December 31, 2015
balance sheet using the full retrospective transition method. The adoption resulted in a decrease in inventories, an increase in billed receivables, contract
assets (i.e., unbilled receivables) and contract liabilities (i.e., customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) to primarily reflect the impact of
converting contracts currently applying the units-of-delivery method to the cost-to-cost method for recognizing revenue and profits. We expect the net impact
of these reclassifications to increase both our current assets and current liabilities by approximately 2%.
In addition, we have completed our preliminary assessment of adopting ASC 606 on our 2017 and 2016 operating results, and have presented selected
recast, unaudited financial data in the following table (in millions, except per share data). The impact of adopting ASC 606 on our 2017 and 2016 operating
results may not be indicative of the adoption impacts in future periods or of our operating performance.

Benefits (T opic 715) on January 1, 2018 as discussed below .
Total net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used by investing and financing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows were
not impacted by the adoption of ASC 606.
Compensation-Retirement Benefits
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), which changes the income statement presentation of
certain components of net periodic benefit cost related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Currently, we record all components
of net periodic benefit costs in operating profit as part of cost of sales. Under ASU No. 2017-07, we will be required to record only the service cost
component of net periodic benefit cost in operating profit and the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost (i.e., interest cost, expected return
on plan assets, amortization
71
Table of Contents
of prior service cost or credits, and net actuarial gains or losses) as part of non-operating income. We adopted the requirements of ASU No. 2017-07 on
January 1, 2018 using the retrospective transition method. We expect the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07 to result in an increase to consolidated operating
profit of $471 million and $846 million for 2016 and 2017, respectively, and a corresponding decrease in non-operating income for each year. We do not
expect any impact to our business segment operating profit, our consolidated net earnings, or cash flows as a result of adopting ASU No. 2017-07.
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which eliminates the requirement to compare the
implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill (commonly referred to as Step 2) from the goodwill impairment test.
The new standard does not change how a goodwill impairment is identified. We will continue to perform our quantitative and qualitative goodwill impairment
test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, but if we are required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, under the new
standard the amount of the charge will be calculated by subtracting the reporting unit’s fair value from its carrying amount. Under the prior standard, if we
were required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, Step 2 required us to calculate the implied value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a
reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the amount of the charge was
calculated by subtracting the reporting unit’s implied fair value of goodwill from its actual goodwill balance. The new standard is effective for interim and
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied prospectively from the date of adoption.
We elected to adopt the new standard for future goodwill impairment tests at the beginning of the third quarter of 2017, because it significantly simplifies the
evaluation of goodwill for impairment. The impact of the new standard will depend on the outcomes of future goodwill impairment tests.
Derivatives and Hedging
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), which eliminates the requirement to separately measure and
report hedge ineffectiveness. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect a
significant impact to our consolidated assets and liabilities, net earnings, or cash flows as a result of adopting this new standard. We plan to adopt the new
standard January 1, 2019.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the
balance sheet and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements for both lessees and lessors. The new standard is effective January 1, 2019 for
public companies, with early adoption permitted. The new standard currently requires the application of a modified retrospective approach to the beginning of
the earliest period presented in the financial statements. We are continuing to evaluate the expected impact to our consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures. We plan to adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2019.
Note 2 – Earnings Per Share
The weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute earnings per common share were as follows (in millions):
  2017 2016 2015
Weighted average common shares outstanding for basic computations  287.8 299.3 310.3
Weighted average dilutive effect of equity awards  2.8 3.8 4.4
Weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations  290.6 303.1 314.7
We compute basic and diluted earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the respective weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the periods presented. Our calculation of diluted earnings per common share also includes the dilutive effects for the assumed vesting of
outstanding restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs) and exercise of outstanding stock options based on the treasury stock method.
There were no significant anti-dilutive equity awards for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation
On November 6, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Sikorsky from United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and certain of UTC’s subsidiaries. The
purchase price of the acquisition was $9.0 billion, net of cash acquired. As a result of the acquisition,
72
Table of Contents
Sikorsky became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. Sikorsky is a global company primarily engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture and
support of military and commercial helicopters. Sikorsky’s products include military helicopters such as the Black Hawk, Seahawk, CH-53K, H-92; and
commercial helicopters such as the S-76 and S-92. The acquisition enables us to extend our core business into the military and commercial rotary wing
markets, allowing us to strengthen our position in the aerospace and defense industry. Further, this acquisition will expand our presence in commercial and
international markets. Sikorsky has been aligned under our RMS business segment.
To fund the $9.0 billion acquisition price, we utilized $6.0 billion of proceeds borrowed under a temporary 364-day revolving credit facility (the 364-day
Facility), $2.0 billion of cash on hand and $1.0 billion from the issuance of commercial paper. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we repaid all outstanding
borrowings under the 364-day Facility with the proceeds from the issuance of $7.0 billion of fixed interest-rate long-term notes in a public offering (the
November 2015 Notes). In the fourth quarter of 2015, we also repaid the $1.0 billion in commercial paper borrowings.
Allocation of Purchase Price to Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
We accounted for the acquisition of Sikorsky as a business combination, which requires us to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair
value. The amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, including the refinements described
in the previous paragraph (in millions):
Cash and cash equivalents $ 75
Receivables, net 1,924
Inventories, net 1,632
Other current assets 46
Property, plant and equipment 649
Goodwill 2,842
Intangible assets:  
Customer programs 3,184
Trademarks 887
Other noncurrent assets 572
Deferred income taxes, noncurrent 256
Total identifiable assets and goodwill 12,067
Accounts payable (565)
Customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred (1,197)
Salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes (105)
Other current liabilities (430)
Customer contractual obligations (a)(507)
Other noncurrent liabilities (185)
Total liabilities assumed (2,989)
Total consideration $ 9,078
(a) Recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
Intangible assets related to customer programs were recognized for each major helicopter and aftermarket program and represent the aggregate value
associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and tradenames underlying the associated program. These intangible assets will be
amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average useful life of approximately 15 years. The useful life is based on a period of expected cash flows
used to measure the fair value of each of the intangible assets.
Customer contractual obligations represent liabilities on certain development programs where the expected costs exceed the expected sales under
contract. We measured these liabilities based on the price to transfer the obligation to a market participant at the measurement date, assuming that the liability
will remain outstanding in the marketplace. Based on the estimated net cash outflows of the developmental programs plus a reasonable contracting profit
margin required to transfer the contracts to market participants, we recorded assumed liabilities of $507 million. These liabilities will be liquidated in
accordance with the underlying
73
Table of Contents
economic pattern of the contractual obligations, as reflected by the estimated future net cash outflows incurred on the associated contracts. As of
December 31, 2017, we recognized approximately $225 million in sales related to customer contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2017, the estimated
liquidation of the customer contractual obligation is approximated as follows: $100 million in 2018, $55 million in 2019, $55 million in 2020, $55 million in
2021, $5 million in 2022 and $12 million thereafter.
The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using income, market and cost valuation methodologies. The fair value
measurements were estimated using significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurement. The income approach was primarily used to value the customer programs and
trademarks intangible assets. The income approach indicates value for an asset or liability based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated
over the remaining economic life of the asset or liability being measured. Both the amount and the duration of the cash flows are considered from a market
participant perspective. Our estimates of market participant net cash flows considered historical and projected pricing, remaining developmental effort,
operational performance including company-specific synergies, aftermarket retention, product life cycles, material and labor pricing, and other relevant
customer, contractual and market factors. Where appropriate, the net cash flows are adjusted to reflect the uncertainties associated with the underlying
assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The adjusted future cash flows are then discounted to present value
using an appropriate discount rate. Projected cash flow is discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and
the time value of money. The market approach is a valuation technique that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions
involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities, or a group of assets and liabilities. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use
market multiples derived from a set of comparables. The cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with
another of equivalent economic utility, was used, as appropriate, for property, plant and equipment. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated
reproduction or replacement cost, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation.
The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of $2.8 billion of goodwill, all of which is expected to be amortizable for tax purposes.
Substantially all of the goodwill was assigned to our RMS business. The goodwill recognized is attributable to expected revenue synergies generated by the
integration of our products and technologies with those of Sikorsky, costs synergies resulting from the consolidation or elimination of certain functions, and
intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as the assembled workforce of Sikorsky.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of
expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on our best estimate of future
sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, customer budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders,
contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. Use of different estimates
and judgments could yield different results.
Impact to 2015 Financial Results
Sikorsky’s 2015 financial results have been included in our consolidated financial results only for the period from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date
through December 31, 2015. As a result, our consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of Sikorsky’s
results. From the November 6, 2015 acquisition date through December 31, 2015, Sikorsky generated net sales of approximately $400 million and operating
loss of approximately $45 million, inclusive of intangible amortization and adjustments required to account for the acquisition.
We incurred approximately $38 million of non-recoverable transaction costs associated with the Sikorsky acquisition in 2015 that were expensed as
incurred. These costs are included in other income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. We also incurred approximately $48 million in costs
associated with issuing the $7.0 billion November 2015 Notes used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 364-day Facility used to finance the
acquisition. The financing costs were recorded as a reduction of debt and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt.

Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information (unaudited)
The following table presents summarized unaudited pro forma financial information as if Sikorsky had been included in our financial results for the entire
year in 2015 (in millions):
Net sales    $ 45,366
Net earnings    3,534
Basic earnings per common share    11.39
Diluted earnings per common share    11.23
The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial data above has been calculated after applying our accounting policies and adjusting the historical results
of Sikorsky with pro forma adjustments, net of tax, that assume the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2015. Significant pro forma adjustments include the
recognition of additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets and additional interest expense related to the short-term debt used to
finance the acquisition. These adjustments assume the application of fair value adjustments to intangibles and the debt issuance occurred on January 1, 2015
and are approximated as follows: amortization expense of $125 million and interest expense of $40 million. In addition, significant nonrecurring adjustments
include the elimination of a $72 million pension curtailment loss, net of tax, recognized in 2015 and the elimination of a $58 million income tax charge
related to historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries recognized by Sikorsky in 2015.
The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information also reflects an increase in interest expense, net of tax, of approximately $110 million in
2015. The increase in interest expense is the result of assuming the November 2015 Notes were issued on January 1, 2015. Proceeds of the November 2015
Notes were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 364-day Facility used to finance a portion of the purchase price of Sikorsky, as contemplated
at the date of acquisition.
The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information does not reflect the realization of any expected ongoing cost or revenue synergies relating to
the integration of the two companies. Further, the pro forma data should not be considered indicative of the results that would have occurred if the acquisition,
related financing and associated notes issuance and repayment of the 364-day Facility had been consummated on January 1, 2015, nor are they indicative of
future results.
Consolidation of AWE Management Limited
On August 24, 2016, we increased our ownership interest in the AWE joint venture, which operates the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent program,
from 33% to 51%. At which time, we began consolidating AWE. Consequently, our operating results include 100% of AWE’s sales and 51% of its operating
profit. Prior to increasing our ownership interest, we accounted for our investment in AWE using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method,
we recognized only 33% of AWE’s earnings or losses and no sales. Accordingly, prior to August 24, 2016, the date we obtained control, we recorded 33% of
AWE’s net earnings in our operating results and subsequent to August 24, 2016, we recognized 100% of AWE’s sales and 51% of its operating profit.
We accounted for this transaction as a “step acquisition” (as defined by U.S. GAAP), which requires us to consolidate and record the assets and liabilities
of AWE at fair value. Accordingly, we recorded intangible assets of $243 million related to customer relationships, $32 million of net liabilities, and
noncontrolling interests of $107 million. The intangible assets are being amortized over a period of eight years in accordance with the underlying pattern of
economic benefit reflected by the future net cash flows. In 2016, we recognized a non-cash net gain of $104 million associated with obtaining a controlling
interest in AWE, which consisted of a $127 million pretax gain recognized in the operating results of our Space business segment and $23 million of tax-
related items at our corporate office. The gain represents the fair value of our 51% interest in AWE, less the carrying value of our previously held investment
in AWE and deferred taxes. The gain was recorded in other income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of AWE (including the
intangible assets), our controlling interest, and the noncontrolling interests were determined using the income approach.
Divestiture of the Information Systems & Global Solutions Business
On August 16, 2016, we divested our former IS&GS business, which merged with Leidos, in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the “Transaction”). The
Transaction was completed in a multi-step process pursuant to which we initially contributed the IS&GS business to Abacus Innovations Corporation
(Abacus), a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin created to facilitate the Transaction, and the common stock of Abacus was distributed to
participating Lockheed Martin stockholders through an exchange offer. Under the terms of the exchange offer, Lockheed Martin stockholders had the option
to exchange shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of Abacus common stock. At the conclusion of the exchange offer, all shares of Abacus
common stock were exchanged for 9,369,694 shares of Lockheed Martin common stock held by Lockheed Martin stockholders that elected to participate in
the exchange. The shares of Lockheed Martin common stock that were exchanged and accepted were retired, reducing the number of shares of our common
stock outstanding by approximately 3%. Following the exchange offer, Abacus merged with
75
Table of Contents
a subsidiary of Leidos, with Abacus continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leidos. As part of the merger, each share of
Abacus common stock was automatically converted into one share of Leidos common stock. We did not receive any shares of Leidos common stock as part of
the Transaction and do not hold any shares of Leidos or Abacus common stock following the Transaction. Based on an opinion of outside tax counsel, subject
to customary qualifications and based on factual representations, the exchange offer and merger will qualify as tax-free transactions to Lockheed Martin and
its stockholders, except to the extent that cash was paid to Lockheed Martin stockholders in lieu of fractional shares.
In connection with the Transaction, Abacus borrowed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.84 billion under term loan facilities with third
party financial institutions, the proceeds of which were used to make a one-time special cash payment of $1.80 billion to Lockheed Martin and to pay
associated borrowing fees and expenses. The entire special cash payment was used to repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock during the third and
fourth quarters of 2016. The obligations under the Abacus term loan facilities were guaranteed by Leidos as part of the Transaction.
As a result of the Transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion, including $1.2 billion recognized in 2016. The net gain represents
the $2.5 billion fair value of the shares of Lockheed Martin common stock exchanged and retired as part of the exchange offer, plus the $1.8 billion one-time
special cash payment, less the net book value of the IS&GS business of about $3.0 billion at August 16, 2016 and other adjustments of about $100 million.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized an additional gain of $73 million, which reflects certain post-closing adjustments, including certain tax
adjustments and the final determination of net working capital.
We classified the operating results of our former IS&GS business as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, as the divestiture of this business represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. However, the cash
flows generated by the IS&GS business have not been reclassified in our consolidated statements of cash flows as we retained this cash as part of the
Transaction.
The operating results of the IS&GS business that have been reflected within net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31,
2016 and 2015 are as follows (in millions):
  2016(a) 2015
Net sales  $ 3,410 $ 5,596
Cost of sales  (2,953) (4,868)
Severance charges  (19) (20)
Gross profit  438 708
Other income, net  16 16
Operating profit  454 724
Earnings from discontinued operations before income taxes  454 724
Income tax expense  (147) (245)
Net gain on divestiture of discontinued operations  1,242 —
Net earnings from discontinued operations  $ 1,549 $ 479
(a) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflect operating results prior to the August 16, 2016 divestiture date.
The operating results of the IS&GS business reported as discontinued operations are different than the results previously reported for the IS&GS business
segment. Results reported within net earnings from discontinued operations only include costs that were directly attributable to the IS&GS business and
exclude certain corporate overhead costs that were previously allocated to the IS&GS business. As a result, we reclassified $82 million in 2016 and $165
million in 2015 of corporate overhead costs from the IS&GS business to other unallocated, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.
Additionally, we retained all assets and obligations related to the pension benefits earned by former IS&GS business salaried employees through the date
of divestiture. Therefore, the non-service portion of net pension costs (e.g., interest cost, actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets) for
these plans have been reclassified from the operating results of the IS&GS business segment and reported as a reduction to the FAS/CAS pension adjustment.
These net pension costs were $54 million and $71 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The service portion of net pension costs related
to IS&GS business’s salaried employees that transferred to Leidos were included in the operating results of the IS&GS business classified as discontinued
operations because such costs are no longer incurred by us.
Significant severance charges related to the IS&GS business were historically recorded at the Lockheed Martin corporate office. These charges have been
reclassified into the operating results of the IS&GS business, classified as discontinued operations,
76
Table of Contents
and excluded from the operating results of our continuing operations. The amount of severance charges reclassified were $19 million in 2016 and $20 million
in 2015.
In connection with the Transaction, Lockheed Martin retained certain liabilities, including liabilities associated with the New York Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and its Capital Construction Company (collectively, the MTA) litigation discussed in “Note 14 - Legal Proceedings, Commitments
and Contingencies,” and has indemnified Abacus and Leidos in connection with other liabilities associated with the IS&GS business, including certain
liabilities associated with ongoing investigations by the Department of Energy and the Department of Justice (DOJ) relating to the IS&GS business’s
involvement in the Mission Support Alliance, LLC (MSA) joint venture that manages and operates the Hanford Nuclear site for the Department of Energy.
The DOJ has issued a number of Civil Investigative Demands to MSA, Lockheed Martin and the subsidiary of Lockheed Martin that performed information
technology services for MSA, as well as current and former employees of each of these entities, and is continuing its False Claims Act investigation into
matters involving MSA and the IS&GS business. The DOJ also is conducting a parallel criminal investigation. The investigations relate primarily to certain
information technology services performed by a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin under a fixed price/fixed unit rate subcontract to MSA. In the event that the
DOJ were to pursue a claim in connection with the ongoing MSA investigation, through the indemnification provisions agreed to as part of the Transaction,
Lockheed Martin and Leidos have allocated liabilities between themselves.
Financial information related to cash flows generated by the IS&GS business, such as depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, and other non-
cash items, included in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were not significant.
Other Divestitures
During 2016, we completed the sale of our Lockheed Martin Commercial Flight Training (LMCFT) business, which was classified as held for sale in the
fourth quarter of 2015. Other, net in 2015 includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of approximately $90 million. This charge was partially offset by a net
deferred tax benefit of about $80 million, which is recorded in income tax expense. The net impact reduced net earnings by about $10 million. LMCFT’s
financial results are not material and there was no significant impact on our consolidated financial results as a result of completing the sale of our LMCFT
business. Accordingly, LMCFT’s financial results are not classified in discontinued operations.

Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense primarily on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: customer
programs, from nine to 20 years; customer relationships, from four to 10 years; and other intangibles, from three to 10 years.
Amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets was $312 million, $284 million and $68 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Estimated
future amortization expense is as follows: $296 million in 2018; $285 million in 2019; $263 million in 2020; $256 million in 2021; $253 million in 2022 and
$1.6 billion thereafter.
Note 5 – Information on Business Segments
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and
services offered. Following is a brief description of the activities of our business segments:
•Aeronautics – Engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft,
including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.
•Missiles and Fire Control – Provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire
control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy
management solutions.
•Rotary and Mission Systems – Provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and civil helicopters; ship and submarine
mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems;
the Littoral Combat Ship; simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. In addition, RMS supports the needs of customers in
cybersecurity and delivers communications and command and control capability through complex mission solutions for defense applications. The 2015
results of the acquired Sikorsky business have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the November 6, 2015 acquisition date
through December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 do not reflect a full year of
Sikorsky operations.
•Space – Engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space
transportation systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground-based global systems to help our
customers gather, analyze and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support
of vital national security systems. Prior to August 24, 2016, the date we obtained control of AWE we accounted for the venture using the equity method
of accounting with 33% of AWE’s earnings or losses recognized by Space. Subsequent to August 24, 2016, we obtained control of AWE and 100% of
AWE’s sales and 51% of AWE’s earnings have been included in our consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, the consolidated results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 do not reflect a full year of AWE operations. Operating profit for our Space business segment also
includes our share of earnings for our investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government.
The financial information in the following tables includes the results of businesses we have acquired from their respective dates of acquisition and
excludes businesses included in discontinued operations (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures”) for all years presented. Net sales of our business
segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation.
Operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity
method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. ULA, results of which are included in our Space business segment, is our
primary equity method investee. Operating profit of our business segments excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment described below; expense for stock-
based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as charges related to
significant severance actions (see “Note 15 – Restructuring Charges”) and goodwill impairments; gains or losses from significant divestitures; the effects of
certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. These items are included in the
reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. See “Note 1 – Significant
Accounting Policies” (under the caption “Use of Estimates”) for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and
operating profit of our business segments.
Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS),
which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and,
therefore, the CAS pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Since our consolidated financial statements must
present pension expense calculated in
78
Table of Contents
accordance with the financial accounting standards (FAS) requirements under GAAP, which we refer to as FAS pension expense, the FAS/CAS pension
adjustment increases or decreases the CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations to equal the FAS pension expense.

(a) On August 24, 2016, our ownership interest in the A WE joint venture increased from 33% to 51% and we were required to change our accounting for this investment from
the equity method to consolidation. As a result of the increased ownership interest, we recognized a non-cash gain of $127 million  at our Space business segment, which
increased net earnings from continuing operations by $104 million  ($0.34  per share) in 2016. See “ Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures ” for more information.
(b) FAS pension expense, CAS pension costs and severa nce charges reflect the reclassification for discontinued operations presentation of benefits related to former IS&GS
salaried employees (see “ Note 1 1 – Postretirement Benefit Plans ”).
(c) The higher F AS expense in 2017  is primarily due to a lower  discount rate and lower expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in 2017  versus 2016. The higher CAS
pension cost primarily reflects the impact of phasing in CAS Harmonization (see “ Note 1 1 – Postretirement Benefit Plans ”).
(d) See “ Note 15 – Restructuring Char ges” for information on charges related to certain severance actions at our business segments. Severance charges for initiatives that are
not significant are included in business segment operating profit.
(e) Other , net in 2017 includes  a previously deferred non-cash gain of $198 million  related to properties sold in 2015 as a result of completing our remaining obligations  (see
“Note 8 – Property , Plant and Equipment, net”) and a $64 million  charge, which represents our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by our equity
method investee, AMMROC (see “ Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies ”).
(f) Other , net in 2015 includes a non-cash asset impairment char ge of approximately $90 million  related to our decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT  business (see “Note 3 –
Acquisitions and Divestitures ”). This charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about $80 million , which is recorded in income tax expense. The net
impact reduced net earnings by about $10 million . Additionally other , net in 2015 includes approximately $38 million  of non-recoverable transaction costs associated with
the acquisition of Sikorsky .

Note 9 – Income Taxes
On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate
income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we wrote down our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 by
$1.9 billion to reflect the estimated impact of the Tax Act. We recorded a corresponding net one-time charge of $1.9 billion ($6.69 per share), substantially all
of which was non-cash, primarily related to enactment of the Tax Act, the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower U.S. corporate
income tax rate, a deemed repatriation tax, and a reduction in the U.S. manufacturing benefit as a result of our decision to accelerate contributions to our
pension fund in 2018 in order to receive a tax deduction in 2017.
While we have substantially completed our provisional analysis of the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recorded a reasonable estimate of such
effects, the net one-time charge related to the Tax Act may differ, possibly materially, due to, among other things, further refinement of our calculations,
changes in interpretations and assumptions that we have made, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Government, and actions and related
accounting policy decisions we may take as a result of the Tax Act. We will complete our analysis over a one-year measurement period ending December 22,
2018, and any adjustments during this measurement period will be included in net earnings from continuing operations as an adjustment to income tax
expense in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined.
Our provision for federal and foreign income tax expense for continuing operations consisted of the following (in millions):

(a) Represents one-time charge due primarily to the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate and a deemed
repatriation tax.
State income taxes are included in our operations as general and administrative costs and, under U.S. Government regulations, are allowable costs in
establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the U.S. Government. Therefore, a substantial portion of state income taxes is included in our net
sales and cost of sales. As a result, the impact of certain transactions on our operating profit and of other matters presented in these consolidated financial
statements is disclosed net of state income taxes. Our total net state income tax expense was $103 million for 2017, $112 million for 2016, and $106 million
for 2015.

(a) Includes one-time charge due primarily to the re-mea surement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate and a deemed repatriation
tax.
(b) Includes a reduction in our 2017 manufacturing benefit as a result of our decision to accelerate contributions to our pension fund in 2018.
In 2016, we adopted the accounting standard update for employee share-based payment awards on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we recognized
additional income tax benefits of $106 million and $152 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The 2016 income tax rate also
benefited from the nontaxable gain recorded in connection with the consolidation of AWE.
Tax benefits from the U.S. manufacturing deduction were insignificant in 2017, $117 million in 2016, and $123 million in 2015. We recognized tax
benefits of $115 million in 2017, $107 million in 2016, and $70 million in 2015 from U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credits, including benefits
attributable to prior periods.
We receive a tax deduction for dividends paid on shares of our common stock held by certain of our defined contribution plans with an employee stock
ownership plan feature. The amount of the tax deduction has increased as we increased our dividend over the last three years, partially offset by a decline in
the number of shares in these plans.
As a result of a decision in 2015 to divest our LMCFT business (see “Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures”), we recorded an asset impairment charge
of approximately $90 million. This charge was partially offset by a net deferred tax benefit of about $80 million. The net impact of the resulting tax benefit
reduced the effective income tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2015.
We participate in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process program. Examinations of the years 2015, 2016, and 2017 remain under IRS review.

(a) Components of our federal and foreign deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017 after taking into account the estimated impacts of the Tax Act and
related items.
(b) The decrease in 2017  was primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Act and our decision to accelerate contributions of cash to our defined benefit pension plans, partially
offset by the reduction in the discount rate used to measure our postretirement benefit plans (see “ Note 1 1 – Postretirement Benefit Plans ”).
(c) A valuation allowance was provided against certain foreign company deferred tax assets arising from carryforwards of unused tax benefits.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits are not material.
We and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the statute of
limitations is no longer open for U.S. federal or non-U.S. income tax examinations for the years before 2014, other than with respect to refunds.
U.S. income taxes have been provided on deemed repatriated earnings of $435 million related to our non-U.S. companies as of December 31, 2017, as a
result of the enactment of the Tax Act. The additional net transition tax of $43 million on the deemed repatriated earnings was recorded for 2017. Before the
Tax Act, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on earnings of $386 million and $310 million that have not been distributed
by our non-U.S. companies as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Our intention before enactment of the Tax Act was to permanently reinvest these earnings,
thereby indefinitely postponing their remittance to the U.S. If these earnings had been remitted, we estimate that the additional income taxes after foreign tax
credits would have been approximately $64 million in 2016 and $49 million in 2015. In addition, we have reevaluated our intention concerning repatriation of
foreign earnings. While our investment in foreign subsidiaries continues to be permanent in duration, in light of our decision to accelerate contributions to our
defined benefit pension plans, earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries may be repatriated.
Our federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds received, were $1.1 billion in 2017, $1.3 billion in 2016, and $1.8 billion in 2015.

Revolving Credit Facilities
On October 9, 2015, we entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year Facility) with various banks. The 5‑year Facility was amended in
October 2017 to extend its expiration date by one year from October 9, 2021 to October 9, 2022. The 5‑year Facility is available for general corporate
purposes. The undrawn portion of the 5-year Facility is also available to serve as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. We may request and
the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase in the borrowing capacity under the 5-year Facility of up to an additional $500 million. There were no
borrowings outstanding under the 5-year Facility as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Borrowings under the 5-year Facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the
5-year Facility’s agreement. Each bank’s obligation to make loans under the 5-year Facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various
representations, warranties, and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and a covenant
not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5‑year Facility agreement. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all
covenants contained in the 5-year Facility agreement, as well as in our debt agreements.
Long-Term Debt
In September 2017, we issued notes totaling approximately $1.6 billion with a fixed interest rate of 4.09% maturing in September 2052 (the New Notes)
in exchange for outstanding notes totaling approximately $1.4 billion with fixed interest rates ranging from 4.70% to 8.50% maturing 2029 to 2046 (the Old
Notes). In connection with the exchange of principal, we paid a premium of $237 million, substantially all of which was in the form of New Notes. This
premium will be amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the New Notes using the effective interest method. We may, at our option, redeem
some or all of the New Notes at any time by paying the principal amount of notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid
interest. Interest on the New Notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2018. The New Notes are unsecured
senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
86
Table of Contents
We made interest payments of approximately $610 million, $600 million and $375 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
In September 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. In May 2016,
we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities. We also had related variable interest rate
swaps with a notional amount of $450 million mature, which did not have a significant impact on net earnings or comprehensive income.
Commercial Paper
We have agreements in place with financial institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion 5-year Facility.
During 2017 and 2016, we borrowed and fully repaid amounts under our commercial paper programs. There were no commercial paper borrowings
outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. However, we may as conditions warrant issue commercial paper backed by our credit facility to manage the
timing of cash flows and to fund a portion of our defined benefit pension contributions of approximately $5.0 billion in 2018.
Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans
Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans
Many of our employees are covered by qualified defined benefit pension plans and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible
retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit pension plans to provide for benefits in excess of qualified
plan limits. Non-union employees hired after December 2005 do not participate in our qualified defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in
a qualified defined contribution plan in addition to our other retirement savings plans. They also have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but
we do not subsidize the cost of their participation in those plans as we do with employees hired before January 1, 2006. Over the last few years, we have
negotiated similar changes with various labor organizations such that new union represented employees do not participate in our defined benefit pension
plans. In June 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees; comprising the majority of
our benefit obligations; to freeze future retirement benefits. The calculation of retirement benefits under the affected defined benefit pension plans is
determined by a formula that takes into account the participants’ years of credited service and average compensation. The freeze will take effect in two stages.
On January 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen so that future pay increases, annual incentive
bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after December 31, 2015 are not used to calculate retirement benefits. On January 1, 2020, the
service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited
service for any period after December 31, 2019. When the freeze is complete, the majority of our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced
defined contribution retirement savings plan. As part of the November 6, 2015 acquisition of Sikorsky, we established a new defined benefit pension plan for
Sikorsky’s union workforce that provides benefits for their prospective service with us. The Sikorsky salaried employees participate in a defined contribution
plan. We did not assume any legacy pension liability from UTC.
We have made contributions to trusts established to pay future benefits to eligible retirees and dependents, including Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary
Association trusts and 401(h) accounts, the assets of which will be used to pay expenses of certain retiree medical plans. We use December 31 as the
measurement date. Benefit obligations as of the end of each year reflect assumptions in effect as of those dates. Net periodic benefit cost is based on
assumptions in effect at the end of the respective preceding year.
The rules related to accounting for postretirement benefit plans under GAAP require us to recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our
postretirement benefit plans as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the
fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan.

(a) Total net periodic benefit cost associated with our qualified defined benefit plans represents pension expense calculated in accordance with GAAP (FAS pension expense).
We are required to calculate pension expense in accordance with both GAAP and CAS rules, each of which results in a different calculated amount of pension expense.
The CAS pension cost is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, is recognized in net sales and cost of
sales for products and services. We include the difference between FAS pension expense and CAS pension cost, referred to as the FAS/CAS pension adjustment, as a
component of other unallocated, net on our consolid ated statements of earnings. The FAS/CAS pension adjustment, which was $876 million  in 2017 , $902 million  in
2016 , and $400 million  in 2015 , effectively adjusts the amount of CAS pension cost in the business segment operating profit so that pension expense recorded on our
consolidated statements of earnings is equal to FAS pension expense. FAS pension expense and CAS pension costs reflect the reclassification for discontinued operations
presentation of benefits related to former IS&GS salaried employees.

divestiture of our IS&GS business (combined $134 million , net of tax).
(b) Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to postretirement benefit plans, after tax, of $12.6 billion  and $12.0 billion  at December 31, 2017  and 2016  (see “ Note 12 –
Stockholders’ Equity ”) includes $17.9 billion  ($11.8 billion , net of tax) and $17.3 billion  ($11.2 billion , net of tax) for qualified defined benefit pension plans, $412
million  ($252 million , net of tax) and $543 million  ($351 million , net of tax) for retiree medical and life insurance plans and $705 million  ($479 million , net of tax) and
$677 million  ($448 million , net of tax) for other plans.
The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all qualified defined benefit pension plans was $48.5 billion and $44.9 billion at December 31, 2017 and
2016, of which $48.5 billion and $44.8 billion related to plans where the ABO was in excess of plan assets. The ABO represents benefits accrued without
assuming future compensation increases to plan participants. Certain key information related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans as of
December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in millions):
  2017 2016

Funded status of plans (b) $ 112 $ 208
(a) Represents accrued pension liabilities, which are included on our consolidated balance sheets.
(b) Represents prepaid pension assets, which are included on our consolidated balance sheets in other noncurrent assets.
We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans to provide benefits in excess of qualified plan limits. The aggregate liabilities for these plans at
December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, which also represent the plans’ unfunded status. We have set aside certain assets totaling
$530 million and $460 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 in a separate trust which we expect to be used to pay obligations under our nonqualified
defined benefit plans. In accordance with GAAP, those assets may not be used to offset the amount of the benefit obligation similar to the postretirement
benefit plans in the table above. The unrecognized net actuarial losses at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $646 million and $642 million. The unrecognized
prior service credit at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $61 million and $74 million. The expense associated with these plans totaled $126 million in 2017,
$125 million in 2016 and $117 million in 2015. We also sponsor a small number of other postemployment plans and foreign benefit plans. The aggregate
liability for the other postemployment plans was $60 million and $63 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The expense for the other postemployment
plans, as well as the liability and expense associated with the foreign benefit plans, was not material to our results of operations, financial position or cash
flows. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense associated with our nonqualified defined benefit plans and
postemployment plans are similar to those assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense related to our qualified defined benefit pension
plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans as described below.

(a) Reflects the reclassification for discontinued operations presentation of benefits related to former IS&GS salaried employees ( $9 million  in 2016  and $16 million  in 2015 ).
In addition, we recognized $134 million  in 2016 of prior service credits from the divestiture of our IS&GS business, which were reclassified as discontinued operations.
We expect that approximately $1.5 billion, or about $1.2 billion net of tax, of actuarial losses and net prior service credit related to postretirement benefit
plans included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the end of 2017 to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost during 2018. Of this amount, $1.4
billion, or $1.1 billion net of tax, relates to our qualified defined benefit plans and is included in our expected 2018 pension expense of $1.4 billion.
Actuarial Assumptions
The actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations at December 31 of each year and to determine the net periodic benefit cost for each
subsequent year, were as follows:
  Qualified Defined Benefit
Pension Plans   Retiree Medical and
Life Insurance Plans
  2017 2016 2015  2017 2016 2015
Weighted average discount rate  3.625% 4.125% 4.375%  3.625% 4.000% 4.250%
Expected long-term rate of return on assets  7.50% 7.50% 8.00%  7.50% 7.50% 8.00%
Rate of increase in future compensation levels (for
applicable bargained pension plans)  4.50% 4.50% 4.50%       
Health care trend rate assumed for next year         8.50% 8.75% 9.00%
Ultimate health care trend rate         5.00% 5.00% 5.00%
Year that the ultimate health care trend rate is reached        2032 2032 2032
The decrease in the discount rate from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligations of our
qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $2.9 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease in the discount rate from December 31, 2015 to
December 31, 2016 resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $1.4 billion at
December 31, 2016.
The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the
benefits included in the benefit obligations. That assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term
allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns.

Plan Assets
Investment policies and strategies – Lockheed Martin Investment Management Company (LMIMCo), our wholly-owned subsidiary, has the fiduciary
responsibility for making investment decisions related to the assets of our postretirement benefit plans. LMIMCo’s investment objectives for the assets of
these plans are (1) to minimize the net present value of expected funding contributions; (2) to ensure there is a high probability that each plan meets or
exceeds our actuarial long-term rate of return assumptions; and (3) to diversify assets to minimize the risk of large losses. The nature and duration of benefit
obligations, along with assumptions concerning asset class returns and return correlations, are considered when determining an appropriate asset allocation to
achieve the investment objectives. Investment policies and strategies governing the assets of the plans are designed to achieve investment objectives within
prudent risk parameters. Risk management practices include the use of external investment managers; the maintenance of a portfolio diversified by asset
class, investment approach and security holdings; and the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet benefit obligations as they come due.
LMIMCo’s investment policies require that asset allocations of postretirement benefit plans be maintained within the following approximate ranges:
Asset ClassAsset Allocation
Ranges
Cash and cash equivalents 0-20%
Equity 15-65%
Fixed income 10-60%
Alternative investments:

Fair value measurements – The rules related to accounting for postretirement benefit plans under GAAP require certain fair value disclosures related to
postretirement benefit plan assets, even though those assets are not separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents the
fair value of the assets (in millions) of our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans by asset category and their level
within the fair value hierarchy, which has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values
determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and
Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. Certain other investments are measured at their Net Asset Value (NAV) per share
and do not have readily determined values and are thus not subject to leveling in the fair value hierarchy. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by
the number of the fund’s shares outstanding. We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the date of the change in circumstances
that causes the transfer. We did not have any transfers of assets between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during 2017.

(a) Cash and cash equivalents, equity securities, fixed income securities and commodities included derivative assets and liabilities whose fair values were not material as of
December 31, 2017  and 2016 . LMIM Co’s investment policies restrict the use of derivatives to either establish long exposures for purposes of expediency or capital
efficiency or to hedge risks to the extent of a plan’ s current exposure to such risks. Most derivative transactions are settled on a daily basis.
(b) Certain inves tments that are valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy and
are included in the table to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the aggregate postretirement benefit plan assets.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the assets associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans were not material and have not been included in
the table above. The changes during 2017 and 2016 in the fair value of plan assets categorized as Level 3 were insignificant.
Valuation techniques – Cash equivalents are mostly comprised of short-term money-market instruments and are valued at cost, which approximates fair
value.

Table of Contents
U.S. equity securities and international equity securities categorized as Level 1 are traded on active national and international exchanges and are valued at
their closing prices on the last trading day of the year. For U.S. equity securities and international equity securities not traded on an active exchange, or if the
closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as
Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor or categorized as Level 3 if the custodian obtains uncorroborated quotes from a
broker or investment manager.
Commingled equity funds categorized as Level 1 are traded on active national and international exchanges and are valued at their closing prices on the
last trading day of the year. For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains
indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated
quotes from a pricing vendor.
Fixed income investments categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest
rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with
similar characteristics. Fixed income investments are categorized at Level 3 when valuations using observable inputs are unavailable. The trustee obtains
pricing based on indicative quotes or bid evaluations from vendors, brokers or the investment manager.
Commodities are traded on an active commodity exchange and are valued at their closing prices on the last trading day of the year.
Certain commingled equity funds, consisting of equity mutual funds, are valued using the NAV. The NAV valuations are based on the underlying
investments and typically redeemable within 90 days.
Private equity funds consist of partnership and co-investment funds. The NAV is based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes
unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have redemption periods between eight and 12
years.
Real estate funds consist of partnerships, most of which are closed-end funds, for which the NAV is based on valuation models and periodic appraisals.
These funds typically have redemption periods between eight and 10 years.
Hedge funds consist of direct hedge funds for which the NAV is generally based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge
funds are based on the specific terms of each fund, and generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.
Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments
The funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended by the PPA, and in a manner consistent
with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. There were no material contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans during 2017. We will make
contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. As a result of these
contributions, we do not expect any material qualified defined benefit cash funding will be required until 2021. We plan to fund these contributions using a
mix of cash on hand and commercial paper. While we do not anticipate a need to do so, our capital structure and resources would allow us to issue new debt if
circumstances change.
The following table presents estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future employee service, as of December 31, 2017 (in millions):

Defined Contribution Plans
We maintain a number of defined contribution plans, most with 401(k) features, that cover substantially all of our employees. Under the provisions of our
401(k) plans, we match most employees’ eligible contributions at rates specified in the plan documents. Our contributions were $613 million in 2017, $617
million in 2016 and $393 million in 2015, the majority of which were funded using our common stock. Our defined contribution plans held approximately
35.5 million and 36.9 million shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Note 12 – Stockholders’ Equity
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our authorized capital was composed of 1.5 billion shares of common stock and 50 million shares of series preferred
stock. Of the 285 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2017, 284 million shares were considered outstanding for
consolidated balance sheet presentation purposes; the remaining shares were held in a separate trust. Of the 290 million shares of common stock issued and
outstanding as of December 31, 2016, 289 million shares were considered outstanding for consolidated balance sheet presentation purposes; the remaining
shares were held in a separate trust. No shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017 or 2016.
Repurchases of Common Stock
During 2017, we repurchased 7.1 million shares of our common stock for $2.0 billion. During 2016 and 2015, we paid $2.1 billion and $3.1 billion to
repurchase 8.9 million and 15.2 million shares of our common stock.
On September 28, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a $2.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total
remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2017. As we repurchase our common
shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of
additional paid-in capital. If additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we record the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value as a reduction of
retained earnings. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the
remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in 2017 and 2016.
Dividends
We paid dividends totaling $2.2 billion ($7.46 per share) in 2017, $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share) in 2016 and $1.9 billion ($6.15 per share) in 2015. We
paid quarterly dividends of $1.82 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2017 and $2.00 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017; $1.65 per
share during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and $1.82 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016; and $1.50 per share during each of the first three
quarters of 2015 and $1.65 per share during the fourth quarter of 2015.

Note 13 – Stock-Based Compensation
During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded non-cash stock-based compensation expense totaling $158 million, $149 million and $133 million, which is
included as a component of other unallocated, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. The net impact to earnings for the respective years was $103
million, $97 million and $86 million.
As of December 31, 2017, we had $91 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted average period of 1.7 years. We received cash from the exercise of stock options totaling $71 million, $106 million and $174 million during 2017,
2016 and 2015. In addition, our income tax liabilities for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were reduced by $203 million, $219 million and $213 million due to
recognized tax benefits on stock-based compensation arrangements.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
Under plans approved by our stockholders, we are authorized to grant key employees stock-based incentive awards, including options to purchase
common stock, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, PSUs or other stock units. The exercise price of options to purchase common stock may not be less than the
fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. No award of stock options may become fully vested prior to the third anniversary of the grant and no
portion of a stock option grant may become vested in less than one year. The minimum vesting period for restricted stock or stock units payable in stock is
three years. Award agreements may provide for shorter or pro-rated vesting periods or vesting following termination of employment in the case of death,
disability, divestiture, retirement, change of control or layoff. The maximum term of a stock option or any other award is 10 years.
At December 31, 2017, inclusive of the shares reserved for outstanding stock options, RSUs and PSUs, we had approximately 10 million shares reserved
for issuance under the plans. At December 31, 2017, approximately six million of the shares reserved for issuance remained available for grant under our
stock-based compensation plans. We issue new shares upon the exercise of stock options or when restrictions on RSUs and PSUs have been satisfied.

date fair value of these RSUs is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date less a discount to reflect the delay in payment of
dividend-equivalent cash payments that are made only upon vesting, which is generally three years from the grant date. We recognize the grant-date fair value
of RSUs, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is shorter than the vesting period if the employee
is retirement eligible on the date of grant or will become retirement eligible before the end of the vesting period.

Stock Options
We generally recognize compensation cost for stock options ratably over the three-year vesting period. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were 2.2
million (weighted average exercise price of $82.71) and 3.0 million (weighted average exercise price of $85.82) stock options outstanding. All of the stock
options outstanding are vested as of December 31, 2017 and have a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately 2.5 years and an aggregate
intrinsic value of $533 million. There were 0.8 million (weighted average exercise price of $95.06) stock options exercised during 2017. We have not granted
stock options to employees since 2012.
The following table pertains to stock options granted through 2012, in addition to stock options that vested and were exercised in 2017, 2016 and 2015
(in millions):
  2017 2016 2015
Grant-date fair value of all stock options that vested  $ — $ — $ 8
Intrinsic value of all stock options exercised  139 172 265
In 2012, we estimated the fair value for stock options at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which required us to make
certain assumptions. We used the following weighted average assumptions in the model: risk-free interest rate of 0.78%, dividend yield of 5.40%, a five year
historical volatility factor of 0.28 and an expected option life of five years.
PSUs
In 2017, we granted certain employees PSUs with an aggregate target award of approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock. The PSUs vest
three years from the grant date based on continuous service, with the number of shares earned (0% to 200% of the target award) depending upon the extent to
which we achieve certain financial and market performance targets measured over the period from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019. About half of
the PSUs were valued at $254.53 per PSU in a manner similar to RSUs mentioned above as the financial targets are based on our operating results. We
recognize the grant-date fair value of these PSUs, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period based on the number of
awards expected to vest at each reporting date. The remaining PSUs were valued at $266.44 per PSU using a Monte Carlo model as the performance target is
related to our total shareholder return relative to our peer group. We recognize the grant-date fair value of these awards, less estimated forfeitures, as
compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies
We are a party to or have property subject to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising
under provisions relating to the protection of the environment and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned. These types
of matters could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the
outcome of each of these matters, including the legal proceedings described below, will have a material adverse effect on the corporation as a whole,
notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our net earnings in any particular interim reporting period.
Among the factors that we consider in this assessment are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss
contingency (if estimable), the progress of the case, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in
similar cases and the experience of other companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond to the proceeding or
claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress.
Although we cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty, where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have
been incurred, GAAP requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make a statement that such an estimate cannot be
made. We follow a thorough process in which we seek to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, and only if we are unable to make such an
estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate cannot be made. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceedings,
a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.
Legal Proceedings
As a result of our acquisition of Sikorsky, we assumed the defense of and any potential liability for two civil False Claims Act lawsuits pending in the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. In October 2014, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in the first suit, which was
brought by qui tam relator Mary Patzer, a former Derco Aerospace (Derco) employee. In May 2017, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in
the second suit, which was brought by qui tam
97
Table of Contents
relator Peter Cimma, a former Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. (SSSI) employee. In November 2017, the Court consolidated the cases into a single action for
discovery and trial.
The U.S. Government alleges that Sikorsky and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Derco and SSSI, violated the civil False Claims Act, the Anti-
Kickback Act, and the Truth in Negotiations Act in connection with a contract the U.S. Navy awarded to SSSI in June 2006 to support the Navy’s T-34 and T-
44 fixed-wing turboprop training aircraft. SSSI subcontracted with Derco, primarily to procure and manage spare parts for the training aircraft. The U.S.
Government alleges that SSSI overbilled the Navy on the contract as the result of Derco’s use of prohibited cost-plus-percentage-of-cost pricing to add profit
and overhead costs as a percentage of the price of the spare parts that Derco procured and then sold to SSSI. The U.S. Government alleges that Derco’s claims
to SSSI, SSSI’s claims to the Navy, and SSSI’s yearly Certificates of Final Indirect Costs from 2006 through 2012 were false. In addition to violations of the
False Claims Act, the U.S. Government alleges violations of the Anti-Kickback Act based on a monthly “chargeback,” through which SSSI billed Derco for
the cost of certain SSSI personnel, allegedly in exchange for SSSI’s permitting a pricing arrangement that was “highly favorable” to Derco. The U.S.
Government also claims that SSSI submitted inaccurate cost or pricing data in violation of the Truth in Negotiations Act for a sole-sourced, follow-on
“bridge” contract. The U.S. Government’s complaints assert common law claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. On January 12, 2018, the
Corporation filed a partial motion to dismiss intended to narrow the Government’s claims. The Corporation also moved to dismiss Cimma as a party under the
False Claims Act’s first-to-file rule, which permits only the first relator to recover in a pending case.
The U.S. Government currently seeks damages in these lawsuits of approximately $52 million, subject to trebling, plus statutory penalties. We believe
that we have legal and factual defenses to the U.S. Government’s claims. Although we continue to evaluate our liability and exposure, we do not currently
believe that it is probable that we will incur a material loss. If, contrary to our expectations, the U.S. Government prevails in this matter and proves damages
at or near $52 million and is successful in having such damages trebled, the outcome could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in
which a liability is recognized and on our cash flows for the period in which any damages are paid.
On April 24, 2009, we filed a declaratory judgment action against the MTA asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to find
that the MTA is in material breach of our agreement based on the MTA’s failure to provide access to sites where work must be performed and the customer-
furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract. The MTA filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently
terminated the contract for alleged default. The primary damages sought by the MTA are the cost to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs.
While we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the
MTA had a total value of $323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. We
dispute the MTA’s allegations and are defending against them. Additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this
matter, who were represented by independent counsel, concluded that the MTA’s termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment
action was later amended to include claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $95 million. This matter was taken under submission by
the District Court in December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties. We continue to await a decision from
the District Court. Although this matter relates to our former IS&GS business, we retained the litigation when we divested IS&GS.
Environmental Matters
We are involved in proceedings and potential proceedings relating to soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater contamination, disposal of hazardous
waste and other environmental matters at several of our current or former facilities and at third-party sites where we have been designated as a potentially
responsible party (PRP). A substantial portion of environmental costs will be included in our net sales and cost of sales in future periods pursuant to U.S.
Government regulations. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record a receivable for estimated future recovery considered
probable through the pricing of products and services to agencies of the U.S. Government, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-
price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S.
Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to
limit such reimbursement. We include the portion of those environmental costs expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts, or that is
determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts, in our cost of sales at the time the liability is established.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate amount of liabilities recorded relative to environmental matters was $920 million and $1.0 billion, most
of which are recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We have recorded receivables totaling $799 million and $870 million
at December 31, 2017 and 2016, most of which are recorded in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets, for the estimated future recovery
of these costs, as we consider the recovery probable based on the factors previously mentioned. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20
years.

Table of Contents
Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating liabilities a matter of judgment because of uncertainties with
respect to assessing the extent of the contamination as well as such factors as changing remediation technologies and changing regulatory environmental
standards. There are a number of former and present operating facilities that we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. We perform
quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites and the related liabilities and receivables. Additionally, in our quarterly reviews, we
consider these and other factors in estimating the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities and record a liability
when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the costs to
be incurred for remediation at a particular site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or
cannot be reliably determined. We reasonably cannot determine the extent of our financial exposure in all cases as, although a loss may be probable or
reasonably possible, in some cases it is not possible at this time to estimate the loss or reasonably possible loss or range of loss.
We also pursue claims for recovery of costs incurred or contribution to site cleanup costs against other PRPs, including the U.S. Government, and are
conducting remediation activities under various consent decrees, orders, and agreements relating to soil, groundwater, sediment or surface water
contamination at certain sites of former or current operations. Under agreements related to certain sites in California and New York, the U.S. Government
reimburses us an amount equal to a percentage, specific to each site, of expenditures for certain remediation activities in the U.S. Government’s capacity as a
PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).
In addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, California previously established a maximum level of the contaminant
hexavalent chromium in drinking water of 10 parts per billion (ppb). Recently, this standard was successfully challenged by the California Manufacturers and
Technology Association (CMTA) for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis. In response to the court’s ruling, the State Water Resources
Control Board (State Board), a branch of the California Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published
regulations, leaving only the 50 ppb standard for total chromium. The State Board has indicated it will work to re-establish a hexavalent chromium standard.
If the standard for hexavalent chromium is re-established at 10 ppb or above, it will not have a material impact on our existing remediation costs in California.
Further, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.
California is also reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate, and the U.S. EPA is taking steps to regulate perchlorate in
drinking water. If substantially lower standards are adopted, in either California or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium, we expect a
material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery
in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is
determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular
interim reporting period.
Operating Leases
We rent certain equipment and facilities under operating leases. Certain major plant facilities and equipment are furnished by the U.S. Government under
short-term or cancelable arrangements. Our total rental expense under operating leases was $169 million, $202 million and $195 million for 2017, 2016 and
2015. Future minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2017 for long-term non-cancelable operating leases were $623 million ($162 million in 2018,
$154 million in 2019, $116 million in 2020, $82 million in 2021, $54 million in 2022 and $55 million in later years).
Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Third-Party Guarantees
We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions and other directly issued guarantees to third
parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds
generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as
venture partners. We had total outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees aggregating $3.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and $3.7
billion at December 31, 2016. Third-party guarantees do not include guarantees of subsidiaries and other consolidated entities.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, third-party guarantees totaled $750 million and $709 million, of which approximately 62% and 56% related to
guarantees of contractual performance of ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum
amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the venture, venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have
cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a venture partner.
99
Table of Contents
In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current
and former venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. There were no material
amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.
United Launch Alliance
In connection with our 50% ownership interest of ULA, we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) are required to provide ULA an additional capital
contribution if ULA is unable to make required payments under its inventory supply agreement with Boeing. As of December 31, 2017, ULA’s total
remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agreement was $120 million. The parties have agreed to defer the remaining payment obligation,
as it is more than offset by other commitments to ULA. Accordingly, we do not expect to be required to make a capital contribution to ULA under this
agreement.
In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other for guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA
under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2017, and that it
will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities or guarantees.
Our share of ULA’s net earnings are reported as equity in net earnings (losses) of equity investees in other income, net on our consolidated statements of
earnings. Our investment in ULA totaled $794 million and $788 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Note 15 – Restructuring Charges
2016 Actions
During 2016, we recorded severance charges totaling approximately $80 million related to our Aeronautics business segment. The charges consisted of
severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated
employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several
quarters. As of the end of the first quarter of 2017, we had substantially paid the severance costs associated with these actions.
2015 Actions
During 2015, we recorded severance charges totaling $82 million, of which $67 million related to our RMS business segment and $15 million related to
businesses that were reported in our former IS&GS business prior to our fourth quarter 2015 program realignment. The charges consisted of severance costs
associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. Upon separation, terminated employees receive
lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service. As of December 31, 2016, we substantially paid the severance costs associated with these
actions.
In connection with the Sikorsky acquisition, we assumed obligations related to certain restructuring actions committed to by Sikorsky in June 2015. Net
of amounts we anticipate to recover through the pricing of our products and services to our customers, we incurred and paid $40 million of costs in 2016
related to these actions.
We have recovered a substantial amount of the restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other
customers in future periods, with the impact included in the respective business segment’s results of operations.

Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (in millions):
  December 31, 2017  December 31, 2016
  Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2
Assets           
Equity securities  $ 39 $ 39 $ — $ 79 $ 79 $ —
Mutual funds  917 917 — 856 856 —
U.S. Government securities  116 — 116 113 — 113
Other securities  170 — 170 151 — 151
Derivatives  23 — 23 27 — 27
Liabilities             
Derivatives  106 — 106 85 — 85
Assets measured at NAV             
Other commingled funds  19     —    
Substantially all assets measured at fair value, other than derivatives, represent investments classified as trading securities held in a separate trust to fund
certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and are recorded in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of
equity securities and mutual funds are determined by reference to the quoted market price per unit in active markets multiplied by the number of units held
without consideration of transaction costs. The fair values of U.S. Government and other securities are determined using pricing models that use observable
inputs (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with
similar characteristics. The fair values of derivative instruments, which consist of foreign currency exchange forward and interest rate swap contracts,
primarily are determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable inputs such as interest rates,
credit spreads and foreign currency exchange rates. Certain other investments are measured at fair value using their NAV per share and do not have readily
determined values and are thus not subject to leveling in the fair value hierarchy. We did not have any transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the
fair value hierarchy during 2017.
In addition to the financial instruments listed in the table above, we hold other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables,
accounts payable and debt. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximated their fair values. The
estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $16.8 billion and $16.2 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The outstanding principal amount was
$15.5 billion and $15.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, excluding $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion of unamortized discounts and issuance costs. The
estimated fair values of our outstanding debt were determined based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets (Level 2).
In connection with the Sikorsky acquisition, we recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. See “Note 3 – Acquisitions and
Divestitures” for further information about the fair values assigned.

Diluted earnings per common share (a) 2.91 3.32 7.93 3.35
(a) The sum of the quarterly earnings per share amounts do not equal the earnings per share amounts included on our consolidated statements of earnings. The difference in
2017 is primarily due the net loss in the fourth quarter causing any potentially dilutive securities to have  an anti-dilutive effect, which resulted in the weighted average
shares outstanding for basic and dilutive earnings per share being equivalent. In addition, the differen ces in 2017 and 2016 also relate to the timing of our share
repurchases during each respective year .
(b) The first quarter of 2017 includes a $120 million  ($74 million  or $0.25  per share, after tax) charge on our EADGE-T program and a $64 million  ($40 million  or $0.14  per
share, after tax) charge, which represents our porti on of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded  by our equity method investee, AMMROC (see “Note 1 –
Significant Accounting Policies ”).
(c) In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a net one-time tax charge of $1.9 billion  ($6.80  per share) , substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to the
estimated impact of the Tax Act (see “Note 9 – Income Taxes”). In addition, the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of $198 million
($122 million  or $0.43  per share, after tax)  related to properties sold in 2015 as a result of completing our remaining obligations .
(d) The fourth quarter of 2017 and the third quarter of 2016 include a net gain of $73 million  and $1.2 billion , respe ctively , reported in net earnings from discont inued
operations, related to the 2016 divestiture of our former IS&GS business.
(e) The third quarter of 2016 includes the results of AWE from August 26, 2016, the date we obtained controlling interest, including $103 million  in net sales and $104
million  in net earning s. Net earnings during the third quarter  of 2016 are primarily the result of a non-cash gain recognized on the step acquisition of AWE (see “Note 3 –
Acquisitions and Divestitures ”). The fourth quarter of 2016 includes the results of AWE for the entire quarter , including $307 million  in net sales and $3 million  in net
earnings.

ITEM  9A.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017. The evaluation was performed with
the participation of senior management of each business segment and key corporate functions, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Management, including our CEO (principal executive officer) and CFO (principal financial officer), believes the consolidated financial statements
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for
the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is
designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
consolidated financial statements for external purposes.
Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. This assessment
was based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
(2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2017.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting which is below.
 Remediation of Material Weakness
During the year ended December 31, 2016, management completed its initial assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting for our Sikorsky business, which was acquired on November 6, 2015. During 2016, we performed our first comprehensive assessment of the design
and operating effectiveness of internal controls at Sikorsky and determined that Sikorsky’s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of
December 31, 2016. Specifically, Sikorsky did not adequately identify, design and implement appropriate process-level controls for its accounting processes,
including Sikorsky’s contract accounting and sales recognition processes, inventory accounting process and payroll process, and appropriate information
technology controls for its information technology systems.
During 2017, management improved controls at Sikorsky in order to remediate the material weakness in Lockheed Martin’s internal control over
financial reporting. To accomplish this we implemented several actions at Sikorsky, including increasing the number of individuals responsible for
implementing and monitoring controls; training individuals responsible for designing, executing, testing and monitoring controls; expanding the scope of the
internal controls program to include additional information technology systems; adding new process-level and information technology controls; modifying
existing controls; and enhancing documentation that evidences that controls are performed. During the third quarter of 2017, we substantially completed our
evaluation of the design of process-level and information technology controls. We successfully completed testing of the improved controls during the fourth
quarter of 2017, and we have concluded that the material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2017. There were no material errors in our
financial results or balances and there was no restatement of prior period financial statements and no change in previously released financial results as a result
of the material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting.
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Other than the remediation efforts identified above to address the material weakness, there were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d‑15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended
December 31, 2017 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Lockheed Martin Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO
criteria). In our opinion, Lockheed Martin Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), consolidated
balance sheets of Lockheed Martin Corporation as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive
income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 of the Corporation and our report dated February 6, 2018
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule or usage.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security of a series is issuable in the form of a Global Security or Securities, each such Global
Security may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of Securities outstanding under the series from time to time endorsed
thereon and also may provide that the aggregate amount of Securities outstanding under the series represented thereby may from time to time
be reduced to reflect exchanges. Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount of Securities outstanding under the series
represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee in accordance with the instructions of the Corporation and in such manner as shall be
specified on such Global Security. Any instructions by the Corporation or the Guarantor with respect to a Global Security, after its initial
issuance, shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 11.04.
Before the first delivery of a Security of any series to the Trustee for authentication, the Corporation shall deliver to the Trustee the
following:
(1) the Board Resolution or Resolutions by or pursuant to which the forms and terms of the Security and the Guarantee have
been approved;
(2) Officers' Certificates of the Corporation and the Guarantor dated the date of delivery stating that all conditions precedent
provided for in this Indenture relating to the authentication and delivery of Securities in that series and the guarantee of such Securities by the
Guarantor have been complied with and directing the Trustee to authenticate and deliver the Securities to or upon written order of the

this Indenture, and that Securities and Guarantees in such form when completed by appropriate insertions and executed by the Corporation
and the Guarantor and delivered by the Corporation to the Trustee for authentication in accordance with this Indenture, authenticated and
delivered by the Trustee in accordance with this Indenture within the authorization as to aggregate principal amount established from time to
time by the Board of Directors and sold in the manner specified in such Opinions of Counsel will be the legal, valid and binding obligations of
the Corporation and the Guarantor, respectively, entitled to the benefits of this Indenture, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency and other similar laws generally affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles, and to such other qualifications as such
counsel shall conclude do not materially affect the rights of Holders of Securities of that series or that are customarily included in similar
opinions by lawyers experienced in such matters.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Corporation shall establish pursuant to Section 2.03 that the Securities of a series are to be issued
in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities, then the Corporation and the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall, in
accordance with this Section, Section 2.02 and the authentication order of the Corporation with respect to such series, authenticate and deliver
one or more Global Securities in temporary or permanent form that shall (a) represent and be denominated in an aggregate amount equal to
the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series to be represented by one or more Global Securities, (b) be registered in the
name of the Depositary for such Global Security or Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (c) be delivered by the Trustee to such
Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instruction; and (d) bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Unless and until it is
exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a
nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or
any nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of any successor Depositary."
SECTION 2.02. Execution and Authentication. Two Officers shall sign the Securities for the Corporation by manual or facsimile
signature. Two Officers shall sign the Guarantees for the Guarantor by manual or facsimile
6
signature. The Corporation's and the Guarantor's seals shall be impressed, affixed, imprinted or reproduced on the Securities.
If an Officer whose signature is on a Security or a Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the
Security, the Security or the Guarantee, as the case may be, shall be valid nevertheless.
A Security and the related Guarantee shall not be valid until the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security.
The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.03 and of the preceding paragraphs, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally
issued at one time (including, for example, a series constituting a medium-term note program), it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers'
Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 2.01 or the Opinions of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraphs
at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the time of authentication
upon original issuance of the first Security of such series. In such case the Trustee may conclusively rely on the foregoing documents and
opinions delivered pursuant to Section 2.01 and Section 2.03, and this Section, as applicable (unless revoked by superseding comparable
documents or opinions), as to the matters set forth therein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold
by the Corporation, and the Corporation shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 2.11 together with a
written statement (which need not comply with Section 2.01 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security
has never been issued and sold by the Corporation, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been
authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
If any Security of a series shall be represented by a Global Security, then, for purposes of this Section and Section 2.10, the notation of
the record owners' interest therein upon original issuance of such Security shall be deemed to be delivered in connection with the original
issuance of each beneficial owner's interest in such Global Security.
The Trustee's certificate of authentication on all Securities shall be in substantially the following form:
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Date:    [Name of Trustee], as Trustee
By     
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Corporation to authenticate Securities. An authenticating agent may
authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes
authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Corporation.
If at any time there shall be an authenticating agent appointed with respect to any series of Securities, then the Trustee's certificate of
authentication to be borne by the Securities of each such series shall be substantially as follows:
7
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

by the Corporation from time to time and set forth in the Securities of that series issued from time to time), the interest payment dates on which
such interest shall be payable (or the manner of determining the same) and the record date for the interest payable on any interest payment

Securities and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably
require of the names and addresses of Holders of Securities of that series.
SECTION 2.07. Transfer and Exchange. Where a Security (other than a Global Security except as set forth herein) is presented to the
Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested if the requirements of
Section 8-401(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor provision) are met. Where Securities (other than a Global Security except
as set forth herein) of any series are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount
of Securities of other denominations of the same series with identical terms as the Securities
10
exchanged, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met. To permit transfers and exchanges, the
Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request. The Corporation may charge a reasonable fee for any transfer or exchange, but
not for any exchange pursuant to Section 2.10, 3.07 or 9.05. The Corporation shall not be required to make transfers or exchanges of
Securities of any series for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities of the same series to be redeemed or before an interest
payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form, a
Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such
series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by
such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
None of the Corporation, the Guarantor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or any co-registrar shall have any responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Corporation that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary
for the Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of such series shall no longer be eligible under Section 2.03,
the Corporation shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities
of such series is not appointed by the Corporation within 90 days after the Corporation receives such notice or becomes aware of such
ineligibility, the Corporation's election pursuant to Section 2.03(19) shall no longer be effective with respect to the Securities of such series and
the Corporation will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an order of the Corporation for the authentication and delivery of definitive
Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
The Corporation may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more
Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event the Corporation will execute, and the
Trustee, upon receipt of an order of the Corporation for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate
and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or
Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
If specified by the Corporation pursuant to Section 2.03 with respect to a series of Securities, the Depositary for such series of
Securities may surrender a Global Security for such series of Securities in exchange in whole or in part for the Securities of such series in
definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Corporation and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Corporation shall execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver:
(1) to each party specified by such Depositary a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination
as requested by such party in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such party's beneficial interest in the Global Security;
and
(2) to such Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of
the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
11
Upon the exchange of the Global Security for Securities in definitive form, such Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee.
Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized
denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall
instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the parties in whose names such Securities are so registered.
SECTION 2.08.    Replacement Securities. If the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen, the Corporation may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate    a replacement Security of the same series with identical terms as the
Securities exchanged if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor provision) are met. Such Holder
shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Corporation and the Trustee to protect the Corporation, the Guarantor, the
Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The
Corporation and the Trustee may charge for their expenses in replacing a Security.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become due and payable, the Corporation in its discretion may,
instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security) if the applicant for
such payment shall furnish to the Corporation, the Guarantor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar for such
Security such security or indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of them harmless, and in case of destruction, loss or theft,
evidence satisfactory to the Corporation, the Guarantor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar, and any agent of any
of them, of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and the ownership thereof.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section 2.08, the Corporation may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including all fees and expenses of the
Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar for such Security) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section 2.08 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for
any mutilated Security, shall constitute an original additional obligation of the Corporation, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security
shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all
other Securities of the same series.
The provisions of this Section 2.08 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to
the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
SECTION 2.09. Outstanding Securities. Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee (and, in the
case of Global Securities, endorsed by the Trustee) except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in
this Section as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Corporation, the Guarantor or an affiliate of the
Corporation or the Guarantor holds the Security.
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.08, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the
replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.
If the Paying Agent holds on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay Securities payable on that date, then on and
after that date such Securities cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
12
If a Security is called for redemption, the Corporation and the Trustee need not treat the Security as outstanding in determining whether
Holders of the required principal amount of Securities have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent.
SECTION 2.10. Temporary Securities. Until definitive Securities of any series are ready for delivery or a permanent Global Security or
Securities are prepared, as the case may be, the Corporation may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities or one or
more temporary Global Securities, as the case may be, of the same series, having endorsed thereon Guarantees duly executed by the
Guarantor in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Indenture. Temporary Securities of any series shall be substantially in the form of
definitive Securities or permanent Global Securities, as the case may be, of the same series, but may have variations that the Corporation
considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Corporation shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate
definitive Securities or a permanent Global Security or Securities, as the case may be, of the same series in exchange for temporary Securities.
Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities or
permanent Global Securities of such series.
SECTION 2.11. Cancellation. The Corporation or the Guarantor at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The
Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee
and no one else shall cancel or destroy all Securities surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation, and shall so certify to the
Corporation. The Corporation may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has paid or it has delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
SECTION 2.12. Defaulted Interest. If the Corporation defaults in a payment of interest on any Securities of any series, it shall pay the
defaulted interest to the persons who are Holders of    those Securities on a subsequent special record date. The Corporation shall fix the
special record date and the payment date in respect thereof. At least 15 days before the special record date, the Corporation shall mail to each
Holder of Securities of that series a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid.
The Corporation may pay defaulted interest in any other lawful manner.
SECTION 2.13. Currency and Manner of Payments in Respect of Securities. (a) With respect to Securities of any series not permitting
the election provided for in paragraph (b) below or the Holders of which have not made the election provided for in paragraph (b) below, except
as provided in paragraph (d) below, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Security of such series will be made in the currency
or currency unit in which such Security is payable.
(b) It may be provided pursuant to Section 2.03 with respect to Securities of any series that Holders shall have the option, subject to
paragraphs (d) and (e) below, to receive payments of principal of or interest, if any, on such Securities in any of the currencies or currency units
which may be designated for such election by delivering to the Trustee for such series of Securities a written election with signature guarantees
and in form and substance satisfactory to such Trustee, not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately preceding the
applicable payment date. If a Holder so elects to receive such payments in any such currency or currency unit, such election will remain in
effect for such Holder until changed by such Holder by written notice to the Trustee for such series of Securities (but any such change must be.
made not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately preceding the next payment date to be effective for the payment to
be made on such payment date and no such change of election may be made with respect to payments to be made on any Security of such
series with respect to which an Event of Default has occurred or notice of redemption has been given by the Corporation pursuant to Article 3).
In the event any Holder makes any such election pursuant to the preceding sentence, such election will not be effective on any transferee of
such Holder and such transferee shall be paid in the currency or currency unit indicated pursuant to paragraph (a) above unless such
transferee makes an election pursuant to the preceding sentence; provided, however, that such election, if in effect while funds are on deposit
with respect to the Securities of such series as described in Section 8.01, 8.02 or 8.03, will be effective on any transferee of such Holder unless
otherwise specified
13
pursuant to Section 2.03 for the Securities of such series. Any Holder of any such Security who shall not have delivered any such election to
the Trustee of such series of Securities not later than the close of business on the applicable Election Date will be paid the amount due on the
applicable payment date in the relevant currency or currency unit as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section. In no case may a Holder of
Securities of any series elect to receive payments in any currency or currency unit as described in this Section 2.13(b) following a deposit of
funds with respect to the Securities of such series as described in Section 8.01, 8.02 or 8.03.
(c) If the election referred to in paragraph (b) above has been provided for pursuant to Section 2.03, then not later than the fourth
Business Day after the Election Date for each payment date for Securities of any series, the Currency Determination Agent for that series will
deliver to the Corporation a written notice specifying, in the currency or currency unit in which Securities of such series are payable, the
respective aggregate amounts of principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities to be made on such payment date, and specifying the
amounts in such currency or currency unit so payable with respect to the Securities of such series as to which the Holders thereof shall have
elected to be paid in a currency or currency unit other than that in which such series is denominated as provided in paragraph (b) above. If the
election referred to in paragraph (b) above has been provided for pursuant to Section 2.03 and if at least one Holder has made such election,
then, on the second Business Day preceding such payment date the Corporation will deliver to the Trustee for such series of Securities an
Exchange Rate Officers' Certificate with respect to the Dollar, Foreign Currency, ECU or currency unit payments to be made on such payment
date. The Dollar, Foreign Currency, ECU or currency unit amount receivable by Holders of Securities who have elected payment in a currency
or currency unit as provided in paragraph (b) above shall, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 2.03, be determined by the
Corporation on the basis of the applicable Market Exchange Rate in effect on the third Business Day (the "Valuation Date") immediately
preceding each payment date.
(d) If a Conversion Event occurs with respect to a Foreign Currency, the ECU or any other currency unit in which any of the
Securities are denominated or payable other than pursuant to an election provided for pursuant to paragraph (b) above, then with respect to
each date for the payment of principal of and interest, if any, on the applicable Securities denominated or payable in such Foreign Currency, the
ECU or such other currency unit occurring after the last date on which such Foreign Currency, the ECU or such other currency unit was
available (the "Conversion Date"), the Dollar shall be the currency of payment for use on each such payment date. The Dollar amount to be
paid by the Corporation to the Trustee of each such series of Securities and by such Trustee or any Paying Agent to the Holders of such
Securities with respect to such payment date shall be the amount that would have been payable in Foreign Currency or currency units but
expressed in Dollars according to the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency or, in the case of a currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of the
Currency Unit, in each case as determined by the Currency Determination Agent in the manner provided in paragraph (f) or (g) below.
(e) If the Holder of a Security denominated in any currency or currency unit shall have elected to be paid in another currency or
currency unit as provided in paragraph (b) above, and a Conversion Event occurs with respect to such elected currency or currency unit, such
Holder shall receive payment in the currency or currency unit in which payment would have been made in the absence of such election. If a
Conversion Event occurs with respect to the currency or currency unit in which payment would have been made in the absence of such
election, such Holder shall receive payment in Dollars as provided in paragraph (d) above.
(f) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency" shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent and shall be
obtained for each subsequent payment after the Conversion Date by converting the specified Foreign Currency into Dollars at the Market
Exchange Rate on the Conversion Date.
(g) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit" shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent and subject to the
provisions of paragraph (h) below shall be the sum of each amount obtained by converting the Specified Amount of each Component Currency
into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate for such Component Currency on the Valuation Date with respect to each payment.
14
(h) For purposes of this Section 2.13 the following terms shall have the following meanings:
A "Component Currency'' shall mean any currency which, on the Conversion Date, was a component currency of the relevant currency
unit, including, but not limited to, the ECU.
A "Specified Amount" of a Component Currency shall mean the number of units of such Component Currency or fractions thereof
which were represented in the relevant currency unit, including, but not limited to, the ECU, on the Conversion Date. If after the Conversion
Date the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the Specified Amount of such Component
Currency shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion. If after the Conversion Date two or more Component Currencies are
consolidated into a single currency, the respective Specified Amounts of such Component Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such
single currency equal to the sum of the respective Specified Amounts of such consolidated Component Currencies expressed in such single
currency, and such amount shall thereafter be a Specified Amount and such single currency shall thereafter be a Component Currency. If after
the Conversion Date any Component Currency shall be divided into two or more currencies, the Specified Amount of such Component
Currency shall be replaced by amounts of such two or more currencies, each of whose Dollar Equivalent at the Market Exchange Rate on the
date of such replacement shall be equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the Specified Amount of such former Component Currency at the Market
Exchange Rate on such date divided by the number of currencies into which such Component Currency was divided, and such amounts shall
thereafter be Specified Amounts and such currencies shall thereafter be Component Currencies. If, after the Conversion Date of the relevant
currency unit, including, but not limited to, the ECU, a Conversion Event (other than any event referred to above in this definition of "Specified
Amount") occurs with respect to any Component Currency of such currency unit and is continuing on the applicable Valuation Date, the
Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall, for purposes of calculating the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, be converted into
Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate in effect on the Conversion Date of such Component Currency.
"Election Date" shall mean any date for any series of Securities as specified pursuant to Section 2.03(11) by which the written election
referred to in Section 2.13(b) may be made, such date to be not later than the regular record date for the earliest payment for which such
election may be effective.
All decisions and determinations of the Currency Determination Agent regarding the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency, the
Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, the Market Exchange Rate and changes in the Specified Amounts as specified above shall be in its sole
discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Corporation, the Trustee
for the appropriate series of Securities and all Holders of such Securities denominated or payable in the relevant currency or currency units.
The Currency Determination Agent shall promptly give written notice to the Corporation and the Trustee for the appropriate series of Securities
of any such decision or determination.
In the event of a Conversion Event with respect to a Foreign Currency, the Corporation, after learning thereof, will immediately give
written notice thereof to the Trustee of the appropriate series of Securities and the Currency Determination Agent with respect to such series
(and such Trustee will promptly thereafter give notice to the Holders) specifying the Conversion Date. In the event of a Conversion Event with
respect to the ECU or any other currency unit in which Securities are denominated or payable, the Corporation, after learning thereof, will
immediately give written notice thereof to the Trustee of the appropriate series of Securities and the Currency Determination Agent with respect
to such series (and such Trustee will promptly thereafter give notice to the Holders) specifying the Conversion Date and the Specified Amount
of each Component Currency on the Conversion Date. In the event of any subsequent change in any Component Currency as set forth in the
definition of Specified Amount above, the Corporation, after learning thereof, will similarly give written notice to the Trustee of the appropriate
series of Securities and the Currency Determination Agent.
The Trustee of the appropriate series of Securities shall be fully justified and protected in relying and acting upon information received
by it from the Corporation and the Currency Determination Agent and shall not otherwise have any duty or obligation to determine such
information independently.
15
SECTION 2.14. Appointment and Resignation of Currency Determination Agent. (a) If and so long as the Securities of any series (i) are
denominated in a currency unit or a currency other than Dollars or (ii) may be payable in a currency unit or a currency other than Dollars, or so
long as it is required under any other provision of this Indenture, then the Corporation will maintain with respect to each such series of
Securities, or as so required, a Currency Determination Agent. The Corporation will cause the Currency Determination Agent to make the
necessary foreign exchange determinations at the time and in the manner specified pursuant to Section 2.03 for the purpose of determining the
applicable rate of exchange and for the purpose of converting the issued currency or currency unit into the applicable payment currency or
currency unit for the payment of principal and interest, if any, pursuant to Section 2.13.
(b)    No resignation of the Currency Determination Agent and no appointment of a successor Currency Determination Agent pursuant
to this Section shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Currency Determination Agent as evidenced by a
written instrument delivered to the Corporation and the Trustee of the appropriate series of Securities accepting such appointment executed by
the successor Currency Determination Agent.
(c)    If the Currency Determination Agent shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the
office of the Currency Determination Agent for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Corporation, by a Board
Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Currency Determination Agent or Currency Determination Agents with respect to the Securities
of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Currency Determination Agent may be appointed with respect to the
Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall only be one Currency Determination Agent with respect to the
Securities of any particular series).
ARTICLE 3
REDEMPTION
SECTION 3.01. Applicability of this Article. Securities of any series that are redeemable at the option of the Corporation prior to their
maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms (except as otherwise specified in this Indenture for Securities of any series) and in
accordance with this Article 3.
SECTION 3.02. Notices to Trustee. If the Corporation wants to redeem any Securities, it shall notify the Trustee of the redemption date
and the principal amount of Securities to be redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Securities. If the redemption is of less than all the
outstanding Securities of a series, the Corporation shall furnish to the Trustee a written statement signed by an Officer of the Corporation
stating that with respect to that series there exists no Event of Default and no circumstance which, after notice or the passage of time or both,
would constitute an Event of Default. The Corporation shall give the notice provided for in this Section at least 50 days before the redemption
date.
SECTION 3.03. Selection of Securities to be Redeemed. If, at the option of the Corporation, less than all the Securities of a series are
to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed by a method the Trustee considers fair and appropriate, subject to any
applicable stock exchange requirements. The Trustee shall make the selection from outstanding Securities not previously called for
redemption. The Trustee may select for redemption portions of the principal of Securities that have a denomination larger than $1,000 (or the
applicable minimum denomination for such Securities in the event the Securities are payable in ECUs or a Foreign Currency or Currencies).
Securities and portions of them it selects shall be in amounts of $1,000 (or the applicable minimum denomination for such Securities in the
event the Securities are payable in ECUs or a Foreign Currency or Currencies) or a multiple of $1,000 (or the applicable minimum
denomination for such Securities in the event the Securities are payable in ECUs or a Foreign Currency or Currencies).
16
Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption.
The Trustee for the Securities of any series to be redeemed shall promptly notify the Corporation in writing of the Securities of such
series selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall
relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has
been or is to be redeemed.
SECTION 3.04. Notice of Redemption. At least 20 days but not more than 60 days before a date of redemption of Securities at the
option of the Corporation, the Corporation shall mail a notice of redemption by first-class mail to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed.
The notice shall identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state:
(1)    the redemption date;
(2) the redemption price;
(3) the name and address of the Paying Agent;
(4)    that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price; and
(5)    that interest, if any, on Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date.
At the Corporation's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Corporation's name and at its expense. In such
event the Corporation will provide the Trustee with the information required by clauses (1) through (5) above.
SECTION 3.05. Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of redemption is mailed, Securities called for redemption become due and
payable on the redemption date and at the redemption price stated in the notice. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be
paid at the redemption price stated in the notice, plus accrued interest, if any, to the redemption date; provided, however, that any regular
payment of interest becoming due on the redemption date shall be payable to the Holder of any such Security being redeemed as provided in
the Security.
SECTION 3.06. Deposit of Redemption Price. By the opening of business on the redemption date, the Corporation shall deposit with
the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest, if any, on all Securities to be redeemed at the option of
the Corporation on that date.
SECTION 3.07. Securities Redeemed in Part. Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Trustee shall authenticate for
the Holder a new Security equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.

SECTION 4.03. Limitation on Liens. The Corporation and the Guarantor shall not, and neither shall permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
incur a Lien on Restricted Property to secure a Debt unless:
(1)    the Lien equally and ratably secures the Securities and the Debt. The Lien may equally and ratably secure the Securities and any
other obligation of the Corporation, the Guarantor or a Subsidiary. The Lien may not secure an obligation of the Corporation that is
subordinated to any Securities or an obligation of the Guarantor that is subordinated to any Guarantees; or
(2)    the Lien is on property, Debt or shares of stock of a corporation at the time such corporation becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; or
(3)    the Lien is on property at the time the Corporation, the Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary acquires the property. However, the
Lien may not extend to any other Restricted Property owned by the Corporation, the Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary at the time the
property is acquired; or
(4)    the Lien secures the payment of all or any part of the purchase price of property upon the acquisition of such property by the
Corporation, the Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary or secures any Debt incurred or guaranteed by the Corporation, the Guarantor or a
Restricted Subsidiary prior to, at the time of, or within one year after the later of the acquisition, completion of construction (including any
improvements on an existing property) or commencement of full operation of such property, which Debt is incurred or guaranteed for the
purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price thereof or construction or improvements thereon, and which Debt may be in the form
of obligations incurred in connection with industrial revenue bonds or similar financings and letters of credit issued in connection therewith;
provided, however, that in the case of any such
19
acquisition, construction or improvement the Lien shall not apply to any property theretofore owned by the Corporation, the Guarantor or a
Restricted Subsidiary, other than, in the case of any such construction or improvement, any theretofore unimproved real property on which the
property so constructed or the improvement made is located; or
(5)    the Lien secures Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary owed to the Corporation, the Guarantor or another Restricted Subsidiary; or

enters into a share exchange with, the Corporation, the Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary; or
(7)    the Lien is on property of a person at the time the person transfers or leases all or substantially all its assets to the Corporation,

other payments or performance pursuant to any contract or statute or to secure any related indebtedness or to secure Debt guaranteed by a
government or governmental authority; or
(9)    the Lien arises pursuant to any order of attachment, distraint or similar legal process arising in connection with court proceedings
so long as the execution or other enforcement thereof is effectively stayed and the claims secured thereby are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings or the Lien is a materialmen's, suppliers', tax or other similar Lien arising in the ordinary course of business securing
obligations which are not overdue or are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; or
(10)    as to any particular series of Securities, the Lien extends, renews or replaces in whole or in part a Lien ("existing Lien") permitted
by any of the clauses (1) through (9) or a Lien existing on the date that Securities of such series are first issued. The Lien may not extend
beyond the property subject to the existing Lien. The Debt secured by the Lien may not exceed the Debt secured at the time by the existing
Lien unless the existing Lien or a predecessor Lien was incurred under clause (1) or (5); or
(11)    the Debt secured by the Lien plus all other Debt secured by Liens on Restricted Property; excluding Debt secured by a Lien
permitted by any of the clauses (1) through (9) and any Debt secured by a Lien existing at the date of this Indenture, at the time does not

through (10).

Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into a Sale-Leaseback Transaction unless:

the property to secure Debt at least equal in amount to the Attributable Debt for the lease; or
(4)    the Corporation, the Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary under clause (11) of Section 4.03 could create a Lien on the property to
secure Debt at least equal in amount to the Attributable Debt for the lease; or
20
(5)    the Corporation or the Guarantor owns or acquires other property which will be made a Principal Property and is determined by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation or the Guarantor to have a fair value equal to or greater than the Attributable Debt incurred; or
(6)    (A)    the Corporation, the Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary makes an optional prepayment in cash of its Debt at least equal in

certificate need not comply with Section 11.05.
SECTION 4.07. SEC Reports. Each of the Corporation and the Guarantor shall file with the Trustee within 15 days after it files them
with the SEC copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the
foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Corporation or the Guarantor, as the case may be, is required to file
with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Corporation and the Guarantor, as applicable, also shall comply
with the other provisions of TIA Section 314(a).
ARTICLE 5
SUCCESSOR CORPORATION
SECTION 5.01. When the Corporation or the Guarantor May Merge, etc.
(a)    Neither the Corporation nor the Guarantor shall consolidate with or merge into, or transfer all or substantially all its assets to
another corporation, unless (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation assumes by supplemental indenture all the obligations of the
Corporation or the Guarantor, as the case may be, under the Securities or the Guarantees and this Indenture, (2) immediately after giving effect
to such transaction no Event of Default and no circumstances which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default,
shall have happened and be continuing, and (3) the Corporation or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture
comply with this Indenture, and thereafter all such obligations of the Corporation or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall terminate.
(b)    In the event that (1) the Corporation and the Guarantor shall consolidate with each other into another corporation, (2) the
Corporation shall merge into the Guarantor or vice versa, or (3) the Corporation shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to the
Guarantor or vice versa, then, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5.01(a), the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation
shall be substituted for the Corporation under this Indenture and the Guarantees shall terminate and be of no further effect.
21
SECTION 5.02. When Securities Must be Secured. If upon any such consolidation, merger or transfer a Restricted Property would
become subject to an attaching Lien that secures Debt, then, before the consolidation, merger or transfer occurs, the Corporation or the
Guarantor, as the case may be, by supplemental indenture shall secure the Securities by a direct lien on the Restricted Property. The direct
Lien shall have priority over all Liens on the Restricted Property except those already on it. The direct Lien may equally and ratably secure the
Securities or the Guarantees and any other obligation of the Corporation, the Guarantor or a Subsidiary. However, the Corporation or the
Guarantor, as the case may be, need not comply with this Section if:
(1) upon the consolidation, merger or transfer the attaching Lien will secure the Securities or the Guarantees, as the case may
be, equally and ratably with or prior to Debt secured by the attaching Lien; or
(2) the Corporation or the Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary under any of the clauses (2) through (11) of Section 4.03 could
create a Lien on the Restricted Property to secure Debt at least equal in amount to that secured by the attaching Lien.
ARTICLE 6
DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES
SECTION 6.01. Events of Default. An "Event of Default" occurs with respect to a series of Securities if:
(1) the Corporation defaults in the payment of interest on any Security of that series when the same becomes due and payable
and the default continues for a period of 30 days;
(2) the Corporation defaults in the payment of the principal of any Security of that series when the same becomes due and
payable at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise;
(3) the Corporation or the Guarantor fails to comply with any of its other agreements in the Guarantees or the Securities of that
series or this Indenture for the benefit of that series and the default continues for the period and after the notice specified in this Section;
(4) the Corporation or the Guarantor pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:
(A)    commences a voluntary case,
(B)    consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case,
(C)    consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property, or
(D)    makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;
(5) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:
(A)    is for relief against the Corporation or the Guarantor in an involuntary case,
(B)    appoints a Custodian of the Corporation or the Guarantor or for all or substantially all of the property of the Corporation or
the Guarantor, or
(C)    orders the winding up or liquidation of the Corporation or the Guarantor,
22
and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days; or
(6) there occurs any other event specifically described as an Event of Default by the Securities of that series.
The term "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, United States Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors. The term
"Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, custodian or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.
A default under clause (3) is not an Event of Default with respect to a series of Securities until the Trustee or the Holders of at least
25% in principal amount of the Securities of that series notify the Corporation and the Guarantor of the default and the Corporation or the
Guarantor, as the case may be, does not cure the default within 90 days after receipt of the notice. The notice must specify the default, demand
that it be remedied and state that the notice is a "Notice of Default." Subject to Sections 7.01 and 7.02 the Trustee shall not be charged with
knowledge of any default unless written notice thereof shall have been given to the Trustee by the Corporation, the Guarantor, the Paying
Agent, the Holder of a Security or an agent of such Holder.
SECTION 6.02. Acceleration. If an Event of Default with respect to a series of Securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, by
notice to the Corporation and the Guarantor or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities of that series by notice to the
Corporation, the Guarantor and the Trustee, may declare the principal (or, in the case of Discounted Securities, such amount of principal as
may be provided for in such Securities) of and accrued interest, if any, on all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately.
Upon such a declaration such principal and interest, if any, shall be due and payable immediately. The Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the Securities of any series by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration (and upon such rescission any Event of Default caused by
such acceleration shall be deemed cured) with respect to that series and its consequences if all existing Events of Default with respect to the
series have been cured or waived, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, and if all payments due to the Trustee and
any predecessor Trustee under Section 7.07 have been made.
SECTION 6.03. Other Remedies. If an Event of Default with respect to a series of Securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may
pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of principal of (or, in the case of Discounted Securities,
such amount of principal as may be provided for in such Securities) or interest, if any, on the Securities of that series or to enforce the
performance of any provision of such Securities or this Indenture.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the
proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall
not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is, exclusive of any other remedy. All
available remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
SECTION 6.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. Subject to Section 9.02 the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of a
series by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default or Event of Default with respect to that series and its consequences. When a
Default or Event of Default is waived, it is cured and stops continuing, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or
Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
SECTION 6.05. Control by Majority. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of a series may direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on it with
respect to that series. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, or, subject to Section
7.01, that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Securities of the same series or would involve the
Trustee in personal liability.
23
SECTION 6.06. Limitation on Suits. No Holder of a Security of any series may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the
Securities unless:
(1)    the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default with    respect to the Securities of the series is
continuing;
(2) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities of that series make a written request to the Trustee to
pursue the remedy;
(3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
(4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and
(5) during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of that series do not give the
Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.
A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over
any other Securityholder.
SECTION 6.07. Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to
receive payment of principal of and interest, if any, on the Security on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Security, or to bring
suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective date, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the
Holder.
SECTION 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default in payment of interest or principal specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2)
occurs and is continuing, subject to Sections 6.02 and 6.04 the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express
trust against the Corporation and the Guarantor for the whole amount of principal and interest, if any, remaining unpaid.
SECTION 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be
necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the
Corporation or the Guarantor, or any of their creditors or property, and unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, may vote on behalf of
the Holders in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other person performing similar functions.
SECTION 6.10. Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article with respect to the Securities of any series, it shall
pay out the money in the following order:
First: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07;
Second: to Holders of Securities of that series for amounts due and unpaid on such Securities for principal and interest, if any, ratably,
without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal and interest, if any,
respectively; and
Third: to the Corporation.
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Securityholders pursuant to this Section.
24
SECTION 6.11. Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against
the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit other
than the Trustee of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit including the Trustee, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the
claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07
or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the Securities of any series.
ARTICLE 7
TRUSTEE
SECTION 7.01. Duties of Trustee. (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall with respect to Securities
exercise its rights and powers and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent man would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
(1)    the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others; and
(2)    in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the
correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates, notices or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming
to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates, notices and opinions to determine
whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
(c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful
misconduct, except that:
(1)    this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section;
(2)    the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer, unless it is proved that the
Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
(3)    the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a
direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05.
(d) Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this
Section.
(e) The Trustee may refuse to perform any duty or exercise any right or power unless it receives indemnity satisfactory to it
against any loss, liability or expense.
(f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree with the
Corporation.
SECTION 7.02. Rights of Trustee. (a) Subject to Section 7.01 the Trustee may rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.
25
(b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee
shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officers' Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.
(c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed
with due care.
(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or
within its rights or powers.
SECTION 7.03. Individual Rights of Trustee, etc. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee
of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Corporation, the Guarantor or any of their affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were
not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
SECTION 7.04. Trustee's Disclaimer. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the
Securities or the Guarantees, it shall not be accountable for the Corporation's use of the proceeds from the Securities, and it shall not be
responsible for any statement in the Securities or in the Guarantees other than its certificate of authentication.
SECTION 7.05. Notice of Defaults. If a Default occurs with respect to a series of Securities and is continuing and if it is known to the
Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder of Securities of that series notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case
of a default in payment on any Security, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith
determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of such Holders.
SECTION 7.06. Reports by Trustee to Holders. If required pursuant to TIA Section 313(a), the Trustee, within 60 days after each May
15, shall mail to each Securityholder a brief report dated as of May 15 that complies with TIA Section 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply
with the reporting obligations of TIA Section 313(b).
A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange on which the
Securities are listed. The Corporation agrees to notify the Trustee whenever the Securities become listed on any stock exchange.
SECTION 7.07. Compensation and Indemnity. The Corporation shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for
its services. The Corporation shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it. Such expenses
shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel. The Corporation shall indemnify the Trustee
against any loss or liability incurred by it in connection with the administration of this trust and its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the
Corporation promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. The Corporation need not pay for any settlement made without its consent.
The Corporation need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee through negligence or bad
faith.
To secure the Corporation's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a senior claim to which the Securities are hereby
made subordinate on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of and interest, if any, on
particular Securities.
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(4) or (5) occurs, the
expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
26
SECTION 7.08. Replacement of Trustee. The Trustee may resign with respect to the Securities of one or more series by so notifying
the Corporation. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any series may remove the Trustee with respect to that series
by so notifying the removed Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee with the Corporation's consent. The Corporation may remove the
Trustee if:
(1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
(2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent;
(3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
(4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.
If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of trustee for any reason, the Corporation shall promptly appoint
a successor Trustee.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Corporation. Immediately
after that, the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as Trustee for the benefit of the series with respect to which it is retiring to the
successor Trustee, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall then become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the
rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture with respect to that series. A successor Trustee shall mail notice of its succession
to each Holder of the Securities of the series affected.
If pursuant to Section 2.03(5) a trustee, other than the Trustee initially named in this Indenture (or any successor thereto), is appointed
with respect to one or more series of Securities, the Corporation, the Guarantor, the Trustee initially named in this Indenture (or any successor
thereto) and such newly appointed trustee shall execute and deliver a supplement to this Indenture which shall contain such provisions as shall
be necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the Trustee initially named in this Indenture (or any
successor thereto) with respect to the Securities of any series as to which the Trustee is continuing as trustee hereunder shall continue to be
vested in the Trustee initially named in this Indenture (or any successor thereto), and shall add to, supplement or change any of the provisions
of this Indenture as shall be necessary or desirable to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one
trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such trustees co-trustees of the same trust
and that each such trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts relating to the separate series of Securities as if it were acting under a separate
indenture.
If a successor Trustee with respect to a series of Securities does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is
removed, the retiring Trustee, the Corporation or the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of that series may petition any
court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
If the Trustee with respect to a series of Securities fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder of Securities of that series may petition
any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
If there are two or more Trustees at any time under this Indenture, each will be the Trustee of a separate trust held under this Indenture
for the benefit of the series of Securities for which it is acting as Trustee and the rights and obligations of each Trustee will be determined as if it
were acting under a separate indenture.
SECTION 7.09. Successor Trustee by Merger, etc. If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into or transfers all or
substantially all its corporate trust assets to another corporation, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any further act shall
be the successor Trustee.
27
SECTION 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification. This Indenture shall always have a Trustee that satisfies the requirements of TIA Section
310(a). The Trustee shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $5,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of
condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 310(b), provided that the question whether the Trustee has a conflicting interest shall be
determined as if each series of Securities were separate issues of securities issued under separate indentures. First Trust of Illinois, National
Association also is the trustee under (i) an indenture dated March 15, 1981, under which the Corporation (as successor by merger to Martin
Marietta Corporation) has issued $175,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 7% Debentures due 2011, (ii) an indenture dated March 17,

of its 7.625% Debentures due 2025.

creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the
extent indicated therein.
ARTICLE 8
SATISFACTION, DISCHARGE AND DEFEASANCE
SECTION 8.01. Satisfaction and Discharge Under Limited Circumstances. If at any time (a) all Securities of a series previously
authenticated (other than any Securities destroyed, lost or stolen and replaced or paid as provided in Section 2.08) shall have been delivered to
the Trustee for cancellation, or (b) all the Securities of a series not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation shall have become due

previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including principal and interest, if any, due, and if, in either case, the Corporation shall also

Trustee in connection with this Indenture, the Securities or the related Guarantees.
SECTION 8.02.    Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.    The Corporation may take any action provided for in this Section unless
the Securities of the affected series specifically provide that this Section shall not apply to the series. The Corporation at any time at its option
may terminate all of its obligations and the obligations of the Guarantor under the Securities of a series previously authenticated and its
obligations under this Indenture with respect to such series (except as provided below), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Corporation,
shall, upon the request of the Corporation, execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction of and discharging this Indenture with
respect to Securities of that series, effective on the date the following conditions are satisfied:

of any payment of the principal of and any interest on the Securities of that series lawful money of the United States in an amount, or (c)
Securities of that series, or (d) a combination thereof, sufficient to pay and discharge the principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities of
that series on the date on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and of the Securities of
that series and 91 days have passed during which no Event of Default under Section 6.01(4) or 6.01(5) has occurred;
(2) if the Securities of that series are then listed on any national securities exchange, the Corporation shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such deposit, defeasance and discharge will not cause such Securities to be delisted; and
(3) the Corporation has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, complying with Section
11.04 relating to the Corporation's exercise of such option.
The trust established pursuant to subsection (1) above shall be irrevocable and shall be made under the terms of an escrow trust
agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee. The escrow trust agreement may, at the Corporation's election, grant the
Corporation the right to substitute U.S. Government Obligations or Securities of the same series from time to time for any or all of the U.S.
Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to this Section and the escrow trust agreement; provided, that the condition
specified in subsection (1) above is satisfied immediately following any such substitution or substitutions. If any Securities of a series are to be
redeemed prior to their stated maturity pursuant to optional redemption provisions the applicable escrow trust agreement shall provide therefor
and the Corporation shall make such arrangements as are satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the
name, and at the expense, of the Corporation.
Upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Section with respect to the Securities, the terms and conditions of the Securities
and the Guarantees, including the terms and conditions with respect thereto set forth in this Indenture, shall no longer be binding upon, or
applicable to, the Corporation or the Guarantor.
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Corporation under Sections 2.04, 2.05, 2.06,
2.07, 2.08, 2.10, 7.07 and 7.08 with respect to the Securities of that series shall survive until the Securities of that series are no longer
outstanding. Thereafter, the Corporation's obligations in Section 7.07 shall survive.
"U.S. Government Obligations" means the following obligations:
(1) direct obligations of the United States for the payment of which its full faith and credit is pledged; or
(2) obligations of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States the
payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States.
SECTION 8.03. Defeasance of Certain Obligations. The Corporation may take any action provided for in this Section unless the
Securities of the affected series specifically provide that this Section shall not apply to the series. The Corporation and the Guarantor at any
time at their option may cease to be under any obligation to comply with Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.06, 5.01 and 5.02 with respect to Securities of a
series effective on the date the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) with reference to this Section, the Corporation has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee irrevocably, as trust
funds in trust, specifically pledged as security for and dedicated solely to the
29
benefit of the Holders of the Securities of that series, (a) lawful money, in the currency or currencies in which Securities of that series are
payable, in an amount, or (b) if the Securities of that series are payable in Dollars, U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of
interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms (and, as to callable U.S. Government Obligations, regardless of when
they are called) will provide not later than the opening of business on the due dates of any payment of principal of and interest on the
Securities of that series lawful money of the United States in an amount, or (c) Securities of that issue, or (d) a combination thereof, sufficient
to pay and discharge the principal of and interest on the Securities of that series on the day on which such payments are due and payable in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture and of the Securities of that series; and
(2) the Corporation has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel complying with Section 11.04
relating to the Corporation's exercise of such option.
The trust established pursuant to subsection (1) above shall be irrevocable and shall be made under the terms of an escrow trust
agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee. The escrow trust agreement may, at the Corporation's election, grant the
Corporation the right to substitute U.S. Government Obligations or Securities of the same series from time to time for any or all of the U.S.
Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to this Section and the escrow trust agreement; provided, that the condition
specified in subsection (1) above is satisfied immediately following any such substitution or substitutions. If any Securities of a series are to be
redeemed prior to their stated maturity pursuant to optional redemption provisions the applicable escrow trust agreement shall provide therefor
and the Corporation shall make such arrangements as are satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the
name, and at the expense, of the Corporation.
The Corporation's exercise of its option under this Section shall not preclude the Corporation from subsequently exercising its option
under Section 8.02 hereof and the Corporation may so exercise that option by providing the Trustee with written notice to such effect.
SECTION 8.04. Application of Trust Money. The Trustee shall hold in trust money, U.S. Government Obligations, and Securities of that
series deposited with it pursuant to Sections 8.01, 8.02 or 8.03. It shall apply the deposited money and U.S. Government Obligations through
the Paying Agent and in accordance with this Indenture, to the payment of principal and interest, if any, on the Securities of the series for the
payment of which such money and U.S. Government Obligations has been deposited. The Holder of any Security replaced pursuant to Section
2.08 shall not be entitled to any such payment and shall look only to the Corporation for any payment which such Holder may be entitled to
collect. In connection with the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or the defeasance of certain obligations under this Indenture with
respect to Securities of a series pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 hereof, respectively, the escrow trust agreement may, at the
Corporation's election, (1) enable the Corporation to direct the Trustee to invest any money received by the Trustee on the U.S. Government
Obligations deposited in trust thereunder in additional U.S. Government Obligations and (2) enable the Corporation to withdraw monies or U.S.
Government Obligations from the trust from time to time; provided, that the condition specified in Section 8.02(1) or 8.03(1) is satisfied
immediately following any investment of such money by the Trustee or the withdrawal of monies or U.S. Government Obligations from the trust
by the Corporation as the case may be.
SECTION 8.05. Repayment to Corporation. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Corporation upon request any
excess money or securities held by them at any time. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay, unless otherwise prohibited by mandatory
provisions of applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property law, to the Corporation upon request any money held by them for the
payment of principal or interest, if any, that remains unclaimed for two years.

ARTICLE 9
AMENDMENTS, SUPPLEMENTS AND WAIVERS
SECTION 9.01. Without Consent of Holders. The Corporation and the Guarantor may amend or supplement this Indenture or the
Securities of any series without notice to or consent of any Securityholder:
(1)    to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
(2)    to comply with Article 5;
(3)    to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities;
(4)    to effectuate or comply with the provisions of Section 2.03(5) or 7.08;
(5)    to change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture; provided, however, that any such change or elimination shall
become effective only when there is no outstanding Security of any series created prior to the execution of such amendment or supplement
that is entitled to the benefit of such provision;
(6) to make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder of any Security of that series; or
(7) to add or change or eliminate any provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary or desirable in accordance with any
amendments to the TIA.
The Trustee may waive compliance by the Corporation or the Guarantor with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities of any
series without notice to or consent of any Securityholder if the waiver does not materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder of any
Securities of that series.
SECTION 9.02. With Consent of Holders. The Corporation and the Guarantor may amend or supplement this Indenture or the
Securities without notice to any Securityholder but with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
Securities of each series affected and the Trustee shall execute any such amendment or supplement at the direction of the Corporation and the
Guarantor. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series affected may waive compliance by the Corporation or
the Guarantor with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities of each such series or the related Guarantees without notice to any
Securityholder. However, without the consent of each Securityholder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver, including a waiver
pursuant to Section 6.04, may not:
(1) reduce the amount of Securities of any series whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Security;
(3) reduce the principal of or extend the fixed maturity of any Security;
(4) reduce the portion of the principal amount of a Discounted Security payable upon acceleration of its maturity; or
(5) make any Security payable in a currency or currency unit other than that stated in the Security.
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplement or amendment,
but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.
31
SECTION 9.03. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act of 1939. Every amendment to or supplement of this Indenture or the Securities
shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.
SECTION 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents. A consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver by a Holder of a Security shall
bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Security or portion of the Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting
Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on the Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the
consent as to his Security or portion of the Security. The Trustee must receive the notice of revocation before the date the amendment,
supplement or waiver becomes effective.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Securityholder unless it makes a change described in
clauses (2), (3), (4) or (5) of Section 9.02. In that case the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has
consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's
Security.
SECTION 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Securities. If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security, the
Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security about
the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Corporation or the Trustee so determine, the Corporation in exchange for the
Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms.
SECTION 9.06. Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc. The Trustee shall sign any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant
to this Article if the amendment, supplement or waiver does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it
does, the Trustee may but need not sign it. In signing such amendment, supplement or waiver the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and
(subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment, supplement or waiver is
authorized or permitted by this Indenture. Neither the Corporation nor the Guarantor may sign an amendment or supplement unless authorized
by an appropriate Board Resolution.
ARTICLE 10
GUARANTEE OF SECURITIES
SECTION 10.01. Unconditional Guarantee. The Guarantor hereby fully and unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Security
authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, and to the Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on such
Security, when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether by declaration thereof or otherwise in accordance with the terms of
such Security and of this Indenture.
The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be as if it were principal debtor and not merely surety and shall be
absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of any such Security or this
Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of any such Security or this Indenture, any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the
Corporation with respect thereto, by the Holder of such Security or the Trustee, or any other circumstances that otherwise may constitute a
legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no such waiver, modification, indulgence or
circumstance shall, without the consent of the Guarantor, increase the principal amount of a Security or the interest rate thereon or increase
any premium payable upon redemption thereof. The Guarantor hereby agrees that this Guarantee shall be enforceable without any demand,
suit or proceeding first against the Corporation. The Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with
a court in the event of merger or bankruptcy of the Corporation, any right to require a proceeding first against the Corporation, protest or notice
with respect to any such Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby or with respect to any sinking fund payment required
32
by the terms of such Security and all demands whatsoever and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged as to any such Security
except in accordance with Section 8.01 or 8.02 or by payment in full of the principal of and interest, if any, on such Security.
The Guarantor will be subrogated to all rights of the Holder against the Corporation in respect of any amount paid by the Guarantor

arising out of or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of and interest, if any, on such Security shall have been paid in full.
The Guarantee set forth in this Section 10.01 shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose with respect to a Security until the
certificate of authentication on such Security shall have been signed by the Trustee.
SECTION 10.02. Execution and Delivery of Guarantees. Subject to Section 2.01, the Guarantor hereby agrees to execute the
Guarantee in substantially the form set forth in Section 10.03 to be endorsed on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee. The
delivery of such Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of such Guarantee on behalf of
the Guarantor.
SECTION 10.03. Form of Guarantee. Guarantees to be endorsed on the Securities shall, subject to Section 2.01, be in substantially the
form set forth below:
GUARANTEE OF LOCKHEED MARTIN TACTICAL SYSTEMS, INC.

unaffected by, any failure to enforce the provisions of said Security or said Indenture, any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise,
waiver, consent or indulgence granted to the Corporation with respect thereto, by operation of law or otherwise, or any other
circumstance which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor; provided that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, no such extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver, consent, indulgence or circumstance shall, without the consent
of the Guarantor, increase the principal amount of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on said Security. The Guarantor hereby agrees
that this Guarantee shall be enforceable without any demand, suit or proceeding first against the Corporation. The Guarantor hereby
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the
Corporation, any right to require a proceeding first against the Corporation, protest or notice with respect to said Security or the
indebtedness evidenced thereby or with respect to any sinking fund payment required by the terms of said Security and all demands

Indenture or by payment in full of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on said Security.
The Guarantor will be subrogated to all rights of the Holder against the Corporation in respect of any amount paid by the
Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce, or to
receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any,

of law.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Guarantee has been duly executed as of the date of authentication on said Security.

SECTION 11.07. Rules by Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar. The Trustee may make reasonable rules for action by or a meeting of

succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday, and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period. If a regular record date is a Legal Holiday in
the state or other jurisdiction in which the Trustee maintains its principal place of business, then the record date shall be the next succeeding

SECTION 11.09. Governing Law. The laws of the State of Maryland shall govern this Indenture and the Securities.

agreement may not be used to interpret this Indenture.
SECTION 11.11. No Recourse Against Others. A director, officer, employee or stockholder (other than the Corporation as issuer of the
Debt Securities), as such, of the Corporation or the Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligation of the Corporation or the Guarantor

creation. All such liability is waived and released as a condition of, and as partial consideration for, the execution of this Indenture, the issue of
the Securities and the execution of the Guarantees.
SECTION 11.12. Securities in a Foreign Currency. Unless otherwise specified in an Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section
2.01 of this Indenture with respect to a particular series of Securities, whenever for purposes of this Indenture any action may be taken by the
holders of a specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of Securities of all series at the time outstanding and, at such time, there are
outstanding Securities of any series which are denominated in a Foreign Currency, then the principal amount of Securities of such series which
shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of taking such action shall be that amount of Dollars that could be obtained for such amount

Corporation hereunder or under any Security or any related coupon it shall become necessary to convert into any other currency or currency
unit any amount in the currency or currency unit due hereunder or under such Security or coupon then such conversion shall be made by the
Currency Determination Agent at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the date of entry of the judgment (the "Judgment Date"). If pursuant
to any such judgment, conversion shall be made on a date (the "Substitute Date") other than the Judgment Date and there shall occur a
change between the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Judgment Date and the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Substitute
Date, the Corporation agrees to pay such additional amounts (if any) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid is equal to the
amount in such other currency or currency unit which, when converted at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Judgment Date, is the
amount due hereunder or under such Security or coupon. Any amount due from the Corporation under this Section shall be due as a separate
debt and is not to be affected by or merged into any judgment being obtained for any other sums due hereunder or with respect to any Security
or coupon. In no event, however, shall the Corporation be required to pay more in the currency or currency unit due hereunder or under such
Security or coupon at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Judgment Date than the amount of currency or currency unit stated to be
due hereunder or under such Security or coupon so that in any event the Corporation's obligations hereunder or under such Security or coupon
will be effectively maintained as obligations in such currency or currency unit, and the Corporation shall be entitled to withhold (or be
reimbursed for, as the case may be) any excess of the amount actually realized upon any such conversion on the Substitute Date over the
amount due and payable on the Judgment Date.
36
SECTION 11.14. Successors. All agreements of the Corporation and the Guarantor in this Indenture and the Securities and the related
Guarantees shall bind its successor. All agreements of the Trustee in this Indenture shall bind its successor.
SECTION 11.15. Duplicate Originals. The parties may sign any number of copies of this Indenture. One signed copy is enough to prove
this Indenture.
SECTION 11.16. Acts of Holders; Record Dates.
(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to
be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such
Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective
when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Corporation. Such
instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the
Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be
sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 7.1(e)) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Corporation, if made in the
manner provided in this Section.
(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of
a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgements of deeds,
certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to such officer the execution thereof. Where such execution is a
by a signer acting in a capacity other than such signer's individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of
such signer's authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same,
may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
(c) The Corporation may, in the circumstances permitted by the TIA, fix any day as the record date for the purpose of
determining the Holders of Securities of any series entitled to give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other action, or to vote on any action, authorized or permitted to be given or taken by Holders of Securities of such series. If not set
by the Corporation prior to the first solicitation of a Holder of Securities of such series made by any person in respect of any such action, or, in
the case of any such vote, prior to such vote, the record date for any such action or vote shall be the 30th day (or, if later, the date of the most
recent list of Holders required to be provided pursuant to Section 2.6) prior to such first solicitation or vote, as the case may be. With regard to
any record date for action to be taken by the Holders of one or more series of Securities, only the Holders of Securities of such series on such
date (or their duly designated proxies) shall be entitled to give or take, or vote on, the relevant action.

Effective December 31, 2017, LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (the “Corporation”) amends and restates the Lockheed Martin Corporation
Consolidated Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan.
Prior to December 31, 2016, the Corporation maintained a number of separate and distinct nonqualified supplemental defined benefit pension plans for select
employees, including the following:
(1)the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan (the “SRP”);
(2)the Lockheed Martin Supplementary Pension Plan For Transferred Employees of GE Operations (the “GE Transfer Plan”); and
(3)the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan For Certain Transferred Employees of Lockheed Martin Corporation (formerly known as the
Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan for Certain Transferred Employees of Lockheed Corporation) (the “LMC Transfer Plan” and, together with
the SRP and GE Transfer Plan, the “Component Plans”).
The Component Plans contained numerous terms and features which were common to all three plans, along with some features unique to the particular plan.
Effective December 31, 2016, the Component Plans were merged into and with each other into the SRP, which was the surviving plan. The surviving plan
was renamed the Lockheed Martin Corporation Consolidated Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan (referred to herein as the “Plan”). The Plan consists of
three parts or components:
(1)the SRP Component (consisting of the former SRP, which includes the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan of Lockheed Martin Corporation
(formerly the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan of Lockheed Corporation), the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Excess Retirement
Plan (formerly the Martin Marietta Corporation Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan), the Lockheed Martin Supplemental Retirement Income Plan
(formerly the Martin Marietta Supplemental Retirement Income Plan), and the Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan (formerly the Loral Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan), which were merged into the SRP effective July 1, 2004);
(2)the GE Transfer Component (consisting of the former GE Transfer Plan); and
(3)the LMC Transfer Component (consisting of the former LMC Transfer Plan, which includes the Incentive Retirement Benefit Plan for Certain
Executives of Lockheed Martin Corporation (formerly known as the Incentive Retirement Benefit Plan for Certain Executives of Lockheed
Corporation), which was merged into the LMC Transfer Plan effective July 1, 2004).
The merger did not change the substantive terms of the Component Plans.
The Component Plans were amended and restated, effective January 1, 2005, in order to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The 2005 amendment and restatement of the Component Plans applied only to the portion of a participant’s
benefit that accrued and/or vested on or after January l, 2005. The portion of a participant’s benefit that accrued and vested prior to January 1, 2005, is
governed by the terms of the Component Plan in effect on December 31, 2004. The Component Plans were amended and restated, effective June 26, 2008, in
order to clarify certain provisions in accordance with the final Treasury Regulations issued under Code section 409A and to make other clarifications with
respect to eligibility and benefits. The Component Plans were amended and restated effective December 31, 2008, in order to make further clarifications in
accordance with the final Treasury Regulations issued under Code section 409A and to make other administrative clarifications. In addition, the GE Transfer
Plan and LMC Transfer
1
Plan were amended and restated effective December 31, 2010, in order to make further clarifications in accordance with the final Treasury Regulations issued
under Code section 409A and to make other administrative clarifications.
On June 26, 2014, the Qualified Pension Plan (as defined under each of the Component Plans) was amended: (1) to provide that pensionable earnings under
the Qualified Pension Plan will not include amounts earned for or relating to any period after December 31, 2015; and (2) to freeze credited service under the
Qualified Pension Plan, effective January 1, 2020, and to provide that no Qualified Pension Plan participant will accrue credited service with respect to any
period after December 31, 2019. The Component Plans were amended and restated to confirm that these Qualified Pension Plan amendments will carry
through to any applicable provision in the Component Plan. Accordingly, base rate of pay, bonuses or other incentive compensation, or other amounts earned
for or relating to the period after December 31, 2015 will not be used in determining benefits under the Plan, and service after December 31, 2019 will not be
considered, deemed to be, or otherwise treated as credited service or similar benefit accrual service in determining benefits payable under the Plan.
Furthermore, the LMC Transfer Plan was amended and restated to close the plan to new entrants effective July 1, 2014.
The SRP and the LMC Transfer Plan were amended and restated, effective for terminations from active service and pre-retirement deaths on or after July 1,
2015, to update the mortality table used for determining the present value of benefits accrued under the Plan after December 31, 2004, when an individual is
eligible for a lump sum payout of such benefits and for certain benefit conversions involving benefits accrued under the Plan after December 31, 2004, from
the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction to the mortality table approved by the Internal Revenue Service for calculating the present value
of benefits for determining lump sums payable under Code section 417(e)(3); provided, however, the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex
distinction will be used instead of the Code section 417(e)(3) applicable mortality table when use of the Code section 417(e)(3) applicable mortality table
would cause a reduction in the amount of benefits payable under the Plan.
The Corporation now wishes to amend and restate the Plan, effective December 31, 2017, so as (i) to reflect all amendments to the Plan or its components
since the prior restatements; (ii) to amend the LMC Transfer Plan to provide that any offset or reduction to the LM Transfer Plan benefit for amounts accrued
under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan is frozen as of December 31, 2019; and (iii) to remove in inapplicable references to plans
sponsored by KAPL, Inc. The formal plan document for the Plan consists of (1) this document, which describes the provisions of the Plan that are generally
applicable to all of the Component Plans (the “Master Plan Document”) and (2) the following three Annexes:
(I)The SRP Annex, which describes the special provisions applicable to the SRP Component and includes:
(A) Appendix A to the SRP Annex, which describes the additional benefits previously provided under the Lockheed Martin Corporation
Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan;
(B) Appendix B to the SRP Annex, which governs the portion of a participant’s benefit that accrued and vested under the SRP Component on or
before December 31, 2004, and includes:
(1)Exhibit 1 to Appendix B to the SRP Annex, which describes the additional benefits under Lockheed Martin Corporation Termination
Benefits Agreements; and
(2)    Exhibit 2 to Appendix B to the SRP Annex, which describes the additional benefits previously provided under the Lockheed Martin
Corporation Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan;
(II)The GE Transfer Plan Annex, which describes the special provisions applicable to the GE Transfer Component and includes:
(A) Appendix A to the GE Transfer Plan Annex, which governs the portion of a participant’s benefit that accrued and vested under the GE
Transfer Component on or before December 31, 2004; and
(III)The LMC Transfer Plan Annex, which describes the special provisions applicable to the LMC Transfer Component and includes:
(A) Appendix A to the LMC Transfer Plan Annex, which governs the portion of a participant’s benefit that accrued and vested under the LMC
Transfer Component on or before December 31, 2004.
2
For the avoidance of doubt, all provisions of a Component Plan that govern any portion of a participant’s benefit that accrued and vested under the
Component Plan on or before December 31, 2004, remains unchanged as a result of this amendment and restatement.

attached thereto). Benefit payment terms and conditions, including the time and form of payment of benefits, with respect to a component and this

2.Vesting. Except as provided in Article IV, and subject to the Company’s right to discontinue the Plan as provided in Article V, a Participant shall
have a non-forfeitable benefit payable under this Plan to the same extent as benefits are vested under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan. As
provided in Article IV, if a Participant acquires a right to receive payments under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any
unsecured general creditor of the Company.
3.Change of Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Committee determines in good faith, based on consultation with counsel and,
with respect to the Non-Grandfathered Benefit, in accordance with the requirements of Code section 409A, that the federal income tax treatment or
legal status of this Plan has or may be adversely affected by a change in the Code, Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(“ERISA”), or other applicable law or by an administrative or judicial construction thereof, the Committee may direct that the benefits of affected
Participants or of all Participants be distributed as soon as practicable after such determination is made, to the extent deemed necessary or advisable
by the Committee to cure or mitigate the consequences, or possible consequences of, such change in law or interpretation thereof.
4.Acceleration upon Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the accrued benefit of each Participant shall be one-hundred
percent (100%) vested, with respect to the Non-Grandfathered Benefit, and be distributed in a single lump sum within fifteen (15) calendar days
following a “Change in Control.”
For purposes of this Plan, a Change in Control shall include and be deemed to occur upon the following events:
(a)A tender offer or exchange offer is consummated for the ownership of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined
voting power of the Company’s then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
(b)The Company is merged, combined, consolidated, recapitalized or otherwise reorganized with one or more other entities that are not
Company Subsidiaries and, as a result of the merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization or other reorganization, less than 75% of
the outstanding voting securities of the surviving or resulting corporation shall immediately after the event be owned in the aggregate by the
stockholders of the Company (directly or indirectly), determined on the basis of record ownership as of the date of determination of holders
entitled to vote on the action (or in the absence of a vote, the day immediately prior to the event).
(c)Any person (as this term is used in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, but excluding any person described in and satisfying
the conditions of Rule 13d-1(b)(1) thereunder), becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly
or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding
securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company.
(d)At any time within any period of two years after a tender offer, merger, combination, consolidation, recapitalization, or other reorganization
or a contested election, or any combination of these events, the “Incumbent Directors” shall cease to constitute at least a majority of the
authorized number of members of the Board. For purposes hereof, “Incumbent Directors” shall mean the persons who were members of the
Board immediately before the first of these events and the persons who were elected or nominated as their successors or pursuant to
increases in the size of the Board by a vote of at least three-fourths of the Board members who were then Board members (or successors or
additional members so elected or nominated).
(e)The stockholders of the Company approve a plan of liquidation and dissolution or the sale or transfer of substantially all of the Company’s
business and/or assets as an entirety to an entity that is not a Company Subsidiary.
6
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the Non-Grandfathered Benefit, no distribution shall be made solely on account of a Change in
Control and prior to the benefit commencement date specified in the applicable Component Plan unless the Change in Control is both an event
qualifying for a distribution of deferred compensation under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code and an event qualifying under this Section 4.
This Section 4 shall apply only to a Change in Control of Lockheed Martin Corporation and shall not cause immediate payout of benefits under this
Plan in any transaction involving the Company’s sale, liquidation, merger, or other disposition of any subsidiary.
The Committee may cancel or modify this Section 4 at any time prior to a Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, this Section 4
shall remain in force and effect, and shall not be subject to cancellation or modification for a period of five years, and any defined term used in
Section 4 shall not, for purposes of Section 4, be subject to cancellation or modification during the five year period.
5.Tax Withholding. To the extent required by law, the Company shall withhold from benefit payments hereunder any Federal, state, or local income or
payroll taxes required to be withheld and shall furnish the recipient and the applicable government agency or agencies with such reports, statements,
or information as may be legally required. No benefit payments shall be made to the Participant until the withholding obligation for taxes under
Code sections 3101(a) and 3101(b) has been satisfied with respect to the Participant.
6.Retiree Medical Withholding. A Participant may direct the Company to withhold from the Participant’s benefit payments hereunder all or a portion
of the amount that the Participant is required to pay for Company-provided retiree medical coverage.
7.Reemployment. The retirement benefit otherwise payable hereunder to any Participant who previously retired or otherwise had a Termination of
Employment and is subsequently reemployed (a) shall be treated in a manner consistent with the treatment of the benefit under the applicable
Qualified Pension Plan or “Designated Qualified Plan” (as defined in the LMC Transfer Component – Grandfathered 2004 Benefit), with respect to
the Grandfathered 2004 Benefit and (b) may not be suspended during the Participant’s period of reemployment except as permitted under Code
section 409A, with respect to the Non-Grandfathered Benefit. This Section 7 shall not apply to the GE Transfer Component.
8.Mistaken Payments. No Participant or Beneficiary shall have any right to any payment made (1) in error, (2) in contravention to the terms of the
Plan, the Code, or ERISA, or (3) because the Committee or its delegates were not informed of any death. The Committee shall have full rights under
the law and ERISA to recover any such mistaken payment, and the right to recover attorney’s fees and other costs incurred with respect to such
recovery. Recovery shall be made from future Plan payments, or by any other available means. This Section 8 shall not apply to the GE Transfer
Component.
ARTICLE IV.
EXTENT OF PARTICIPANTS’ RIGHTS
1.Unfunded Status of Plan. This Plan constitutes a mere contractual promise by the Company to make payments in the future, and each Participant’s
rights shall be those of a general, unsecured creditor of the Company. No Participant shall have any beneficial interest in any specific assets that the
Company may hold or set aside in connection with this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to assist the Company in meeting its obligations under
this Plan, the Company may set aside assets in a trust or trusts described in Revenue Procedure 92-64, 1992-2 C.B. 422, and the Company may direct
that its obligations under this Plan be satisfied by payments out of such trust or trusts. The assets of any such trust will remain subject to the claims
of the general creditors of the Company. It is the Company’s intention that the Plan be unfunded for Federal income tax purposes and for purposes of
Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
2.Nonalienability of Benefits. A Participant’s rights under this Plan shall not be assignable or transferable and any purported transfer, assignment,
pledge or other encumbrance or attachment of any payments or
7
benefits under this Plan, or any interest therein shall not be permitted or recognized, other than the designation of, or passage of payment rights to, a
Beneficiary or transfer of an interest in this Plan to: (a) with respect to the Non-Grandfathered Benefit, a Participant’s spouse, former spouse, or child
incident to divorce under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (which shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with Code sections
414(p)(1)(B) and 409A), provided that the form of payment designated in such order is an annuity as provided in the Non-Grandfathered Benefit
Component Plans, and (b) with respect to the Grandfathered 2004 Benefit, a Participant’s former spouse incident to divorce under a Qualified
Domestic Relations Order.
3.Forfeiture. If, following the date on which a Participant shall retire under this Plan, a Participant shall engage in the operation or management of a
business, whether as owner, stockholder, partner, officer, employee, consultant, or otherwise, which at such time is in competition with the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, or shall disclose to unauthorized persons information relative to the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
which the Participant shall have reason to believe is confidential, or otherwise act, or conduct oneself, in a manner which the Participant shall have
reason to believe is contrary to the best interest of the Company, or shall be found by the Committee to have committed an act during the term of the
Participant’s employment which would have justified the Participant being discharged for cause, the Participant’s retirement benefit under this Plan
shall terminate. Application of this Section will be at the discretion of the Committee.
ARTICLE V.
AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION
1.Amendment. The Board or its authorized delegate may amend, modify, suspend or discontinue this Plan at any time subject to any shareholder
approval that may be required under applicable law, provided, however, that no such amendment shall have the effect of reducing a Participant’s
accrued benefit or postponing the time when a Participant is entitled to receive a distribution of his accrued benefit unless each affected Participant
consents to such change.
2.Termination. The Board reserves the right to terminate this Plan at any time and at such times that the Board reasonably determines in its discretion
is appropriate and, with respect to the Non-Grandfathered Benefit, conforms to the requirements of Code section 409A; to pay all Participants their
accrued benefits in a lump sum or to make other provisions for the payment of benefits (e.g., purchase of annuities) immediately following such
termination or at such time thereafter as the Board may determine.
3.Transfer of Liability. The Board reserves the right to transfer to another entity all of the obligations of the Company with respect to a Participant
under this Plan if such entity agrees pursuant to a binding written agreement with the Company or its subsidiaries to assume all of the obligations of
the Company under this Plan with respect to such Participant.
4.Merger. The Board reserves the right to merge all or part of this Plan with or into another plan, provided (1) such other plan preserves all of the
obligations of the Company under this Plan with respect to such Participant and (2) each Participant in the Plan would (if the Plan then terminated)
receive a benefit immediately after the merger which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before
the merger (if the Plan had then terminated).
ARTICLE VI.
ADMINISTRATION
1.The Committee. This Plan shall be administered by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board or such other
committee of the Board as may be designated by the Board. The members of the Committee shall be designated by the Board. A majority of the
members of the Committee (but no fewer than two) shall constitute a quorum. The vote of a majority of a quorum or the unanimous written consent
of the Committee shall constitute action by the Committee. The Committee and its delegates (including the Claims Administrator) shall have full
discretion to construe and interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan, which interpretation or construction shall be final, conclusive and binding
on all
8
parties, including but not limited to the Company and any Participant or Beneficiary, except as otherwise provided by law.
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan or in any document issued under the Plan, it is intended that the Non-Grandfathered Benefit will at
all times conform to the requirements of Code section 409A and any regulations or other guidance issued thereunder and that the provisions of the
Plan relating to the Non-Grandfathered Benefit will be interpreted to meet such requirements. If any provision of the Plan relating to the Non-
Grandfathered Benefit is determined not to conform to such requirements, the Plan shall be interpreted to omit such offending provision.
2.Delegation and Reliance. The Committee may delegate to the officers or employees of the Company the authority to execute and deliver those
instruments and documents to do all acts and things, and to take all other steps deemed necessary, advisable or convenient for the effective
administration of this Plan in accordance with its terms and purpose. In making any determination or in taking or not taking any action under this
Plan, the Committee (or its delegate) may obtain and rely upon the advice of experts, including professional advisors to the Company. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 6, the Committee delegates the authority to adjudicate claims to the Pension Administrative Committee. No member
of the Committee or officer of the Company who is a Participant hereunder may participate in any decision specifically relating to his or her
individual rights or benefits under the Plan.
3.Exculpation and Indemnity. Neither the Company nor any member of the Board or of the Committee, nor any other person participating in any
determination of any question under this Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, shall have any liability to any party for
any action taken or not taken in good faith under this Plan or for the failure of the Plan or any Participant’s rights under the Plan to achieve intended
tax consequences, or to comply with any other law, compliance with which is not required on the part of the Company.
4.Facility of Payment. If a minor person declared incompetent, or person incapable of handling the disposition of his or her property is entitled to
receive a benefit, make an application, or make an election hereunder, the Committee or Claims Administrator may direct that such benefits be paid
to, or such application or election be made by, the guardian, legal representative, or person having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent,
or incapable person. Any payment made, application allowed, or election implemented in accordance with this Section shall completely discharge
the Company and the Committee (or Claims Administrator) from all liability with respect thereto.
5.Proof of Claims. The Committee or Claims Administrator may require proof of the death, disability, incompetency, minority, or incapacity of any
Participant or Beneficiary and of the right of a person to receive any benefit or make any application or election.
6.Claim Procedures. The procedures when a claim under this Plan is wholly or partially denied by the Claims Administrator are as follows:
(a)The Claims Administrator shall, within 90 days after receipt of a claim, furnish to claimant a written notice setting forth, in a manner
calculated to be understood by claimant: (1) the specific reason or reasons for the denial; (2) specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions
on which the denial is based; (3) a description of any additional materials or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and
an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; (4) an explanation of the steps to be taken if the claimant wishes to have
the denial reviewed; and (5) a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse
determination on review. The 90-day period may be extended for not more than an additional 90 days if special circumstances make such an
extension necessary. The Claims Administrator shall give the claimant, before the end of the initial 90-day period, a written notice of such
extension, stating such special circumstances and the date by which the Claims Administrator expects to render a decision.
9
(b)By a written application filed with the Claims Administrator within 60 days after receipt by claimant of the written notice described in
paragraph (a), the claimant or his duly authorized representative may request review of the denial of his claim.
(c)In connection with such review, the claimant or his duly authorized representative may submit issues, comments, documents, records and
other information relating to the claim for benefits to the Claims Administrator. In addition, the claimant will be provided, upon request and
free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, or other information “relevant” to claimant’s claim for benefits. A
document, record, or other information is “relevant” if it: (1) was relied upon in making the benefit determination; (2) was submitted,
considered or generated in the course of making the benefit determination, without regard to whether such document, record or information
was relied upon in making the benefit determination; or (3) demonstrates compliance with administrative processes and safeguards required
under federal law.
(d)The Plan will provide an impartial review that takes into account all comments, records and other information submitted by the claimant
relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The
Claims Administrator shall make a decision and furnish such decision in writing to the claimant within 60 days after receipt by the Claims
Administrator of the request for review. This period may be extended to not more than 120 days after such receipt if special circumstances
make such an extension necessary. The claimant will be notified in writing prior to the expiration of the original 60-day period if such an
extension is required, and such notice will include the reason for the extension and the date by which it is expected that a decision will be
reached. The decision on review shall be in writing, set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include: (1)
the specific reasons for the decision; (2) specific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based; (3) a statement
that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, and other
information “relevant” to the claimant’s claim for benefits; (4) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the
claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; (5) a statement describing any voluntary
appeal procedures and the claimant’s right to obtain information about such procedures, if any; and (6) a statement of the claimant’s right to
bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review.
(e)If in the event that the Claims Administrator must make a determination of disability in order to decide a claim, the Claims Administrator
shall follow the special claims procedures for disability benefits described in Department of Labor Regulation section 2560.503-1(d). The
Claims Administrator shall render a decision within a reasonable time (not to exceed 90 days) after the claimant’s request for review, rather
than within 120 days as set forth in the above paragraph.
(f)The Claims Administrator shall be the Pension Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to claims and appeals brought by
elected officers of the Company, the Claims Administrator shall be the Committee.

ANNEX I
THE SRP COMPONENT
The purposes of the SRP Component are: (a) to provide certain employees of the Company with those benefits that cannot be paid from the Company’s tax ‐
qualified plans because of the limitations on contributions and benefits contained in Code section 415; (b) to provide certain key management employees of
the Company with those benefits that cannot be paid from the Company’s tax-qualified plans because of other limitations on contributions and benefits
contained in the Code, such as the limitations contained in Code section 401(a)(17); and (c) to provide certain key management employees of the Company
with other supplemental benefits.
ARTICLE I.
DEFINITIONS
Unless the context indicates otherwise or the term is defined below or in the Master Plan Document, all terms shall be defined in accordance with the
Lockheed Martin Corporation Retirement Program.
ARTICLE II.
EXCESS BENEFIT PROVISIONS
1.Eligibility. An Eligible Employee who is entitled to benefits under a Qualified Pension Plan, and whose retirement income benefits are limited by the
provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan (as amended from time to time) relating to the limits under Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17)
shall receive benefits pursuant to this Article II.
2.Amount of Benefit. The benefit that each Participant shall be entitled to receive under the Plan is the amount reasonably determined by the Company to
be the difference between the Participant’s actual benefit under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan and the benefits that would have been payable
under that Plan if:
(a)the Qualified Pension Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below; and
(b)the Participant’s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable earnings under a Qualified Pension
Plan, the Participant’s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match” basis. The Participant’s annual compensation earned under the
MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable earnings. The average of the three (3) highest years of MICP compensation during the last
10 years shall be added to the average of the three (3) highest years of other pensionable earnings during the last 10 years to arrive at total final average
pensionable earnings for the applicable period under the Qualified Pension Plan.
Benefits under this Article II are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide
the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan on a “mix and match” basis and without
regard to the limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17). To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the applicable Qualified
Pension Plan (without regard of to the portion of the benefit attributable to employee contributions, if any) shall be calculated without reduction for Code
section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the applicable Qualified Pension Plan, and then reduced further by the
Grandfathered 2004 Benefit, then further reduced by the benefit payable from other nonqualified pension plans of the Company which corresponds to the
benefit payable under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan (including any benefit payable under Appendix A of this Annex I and excluding any nonqualified
plans designed to supplement qualified defined contribution plans) to the extent permitted under Code section 409A. The remaining benefit shall be paid from
this Plan pursuant to this Article II. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make
such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
1
The benefit payable under this Article II shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary who is receiving or entitled to receive benefits with respect to the
Participant under the Qualified Pension Plan.
If the benefits payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’s retirement as a result of a general increase
in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan.
ARTICLE III.
SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS
In addition to the benefits described in Article II, the Plan also provides benefits to certain key management employees, as set forth in the Appendices hereto.
Eligibility for, and the amount of, such benefits is set forth in the applicable Appendix. Payment options for such benefits are described in Article IV.
ARTICLE IV.
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1.Form and Timing of Payment. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Participant may make an initial payment election between an annuity and a lump
sum payment under the terms and conditions described in this Section 1. All elections under this Section 1 must be made in the form and manner
prescribed by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources. No election made pursuant to this Section 1 may affect a payment due in the same calendar
year in which the election is made or accelerate payment into the calendar year in which the election is made.
a.Regular Form. Unless a Participant has elected a lump sum payment under Section 1.b. of this Article IV, benefits under this Plan shall be paid
in the form of an annuity. Participants who first become eligible for participation in the Plan after December 16, 2005 shall receive their benefits
in the form of an annuity. Benefits paid in a form described in this Section 1.a. shall commence as soon as administratively practicable (but no
more than 90 days) following the later of (i) the month in which the Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the
Participant attains age fifty-five (55). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, benefits paid in a form described in this Section 1.a. to a
Participant who is reasonably determined by the Company to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code section 409A(2)(B)(i),
shall not commence before the later of (i) six (6) months following the month in which the Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii)
the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of Employment or
attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date.
i.Selection of Annuity Form. Prior to his Termination of Employment or attainment of age 55, as applicable, a Participant may elect to
receive benefits in any actuarially equivalent annuity form that is available under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan on the date of
the Participant’s election that has been designated by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources as available for election under this
Plan. If the Participant has not validly elected an annuity form before his Termination of Employment or attainment of age 55, as
applicable, under this Section 1.a. or a lump sum payment as provided in Section 1.b. of Article IV, (i) an unmarried Participant shall be
deemed to have elected payment in the form of a monthly annuity for the life of the Participant with no further payments to anyone
after his or her death, and (ii) a married Participant shall be deemed to have elected payment in the form of a reduced monthly annuity
for the life of the Participant with, after the Participant’s death, a 50% survivor annuity for the life of the Participant’s spouse. Actuarial
adjustments shall be based on the factors set forth in the Qualified Pension Plan.
b.Lump Sum Option. This Section shall not apply to Participants who first become eligible for participation in the Plan after December 16, 2005.
In lieu of the forms described in Section 1.a. of Article IV, a Participant may make a one-time initial election to receive a full lump sum payment
in an amount which is the Actuarial Equivalent of a monthly annuity for the life of the Participant with no
2
further payments to anyone after his or her death, provided the election is filed with the Company in writing no later than December 31, 2008
(or such other date determined by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources and communicated to Participants) and the Participant’s
employment has not terminated employment prior to filing the election. For all Participants who elect a lump sum under this Section 1.b., the
lump sum payment shall be made six (6) months following the later of (i) the month in which the Participant has a Termination of Employment,
or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of Employment or
attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date. All elections under this Section 1.b. must be made in the form and manner
prescribed by the Company. Such election shall be irrevocable except as provided in Section 1.e. of Article IV.
c.Cash-out of Small Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, if the Value of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary under this
Plan does not exceed $10,000, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum payment in full discharge of all liabilities with respect to such
benefits. For purposes of this Section, Value shall be determined as of the Participant’s Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-
five (55), as applicable, and shall mean the present value of a Participant’s or Beneficiary’s benefits, excluding the Grandfathered 2004 Benefit,
based (i) for Terminations of Employment prior to January 1, 2008, upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate in Code
section 417(e)(3)(ii), or (ii) for terminations on or after January 1, 2008, upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate under
Code section 417(e)(3), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, for the calendar month preceding the Plan Year in which the
termination of employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55) occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, benefits paid under this Section
1.c. to a Participant who is reasonably determined by the Company to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code section 409A(2)
(B)(i), shall not commence before six (6) months following the later of (i) the month in which the Participant has a Termination of Employment,
or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of Employment or
attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date.
d.Payment Upon Death or Disability.
i.Death. No other death benefits are provided under this Plan other than as specified in this Section 1.d.i.
A.Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit. In the event the Participant dies prior to terminating employment or attaining age 55, a pre-
retirement survivor benefit will be payable to the Participant’s surviving spouse (if any) (the “Pre-Retirement Survivor
Benefit” and the “Surviving Spouse”) in the form elected by the Participant under the terms of the Plan. If the Participant’s
benefit was payable in a lump sum, the lump sum shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of a monthly annuity payable for the life of
the Surviving Spouse with no further payments to anyone after his or her death. The Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit shall
commence as soon as administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days) following the later of (i) the month in which the
Participant dies, or (ii) the month in which the Participant would have attained age fifty-five (55). No Pre-Retirement Survivor
Benefit is payable to anyone other than the Participant’s Surviving Spouse. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to all
Participants who elected a lump sum under Section 1.b., a lump sum Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit shall be paid to the
Participant’s Surviving Spouse six (6) months following the later of (i) the month in which the Participant dies, or (ii) the
month in which the Participant would have attained age fifty-five (55).
B.Death After Termination of Employment or Attainment of Age 55. If a Participant who is required to wait six (6) months for a
lump sum payment (in accordance with Section 1 of Article IV) dies after the Participant’s Termination of Employment or
attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, but before payment is made, the lump
3
sum payment shall be made to the Participant’s Beneficiary as soon as administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days)
following the death of the Participant.
ii.Disability. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article IV, the benefit of a Disabled Participant who is eligible for a disability
pension from the Lockheed Martin Retirement Income Plan, , or the Lockheed Martin Corporation Retirement Income Plan III shall be
paid in the form elected by the Participant under the terms of the Plan as soon as administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days)
following the date the Participant is reasonably determined by the Company to be Disabled. For the purposes of this Section 1.d.ii., the
terms “Disabled” or “Disability” shall have the meaning set forth in the Lockheed Martin Retirement Income Plan, or the Lockheed
Martin Corporation Retirement Income Plan III, as applicable, to the extent consistent with the requirements of Code section 409A(a)
(2)(C).
e.Prospective Change of Payment Elections. Participants may elect to change the form of payment of benefits or further delay the commencement
of benefits as provided in this Section 1.e. All elections under this Section 1.e. must be made in the form and manner prescribed by the
Company. This Section 1.e. does not apply to Surviving Spouses or Beneficiaries. Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, other
changes in the form of benefit, including changes between actuarially equivalent forms of benefit, if any, may be made only as determined by
the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, of the Company in accordance with Code section 409A.
i.Form of Payment. A Participant who has validly elected (or deemed to have elected) payment as an annuity (as described in Section
1.a. of Article IV) or has validly elected a lump sum payment (in accordance with Section 1.b. of Article IV) may later elect to receive
payment in any form (annuity or lump sum) designated by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, of the Company, provided that
such election is made in the form and manner determined by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources not less than twelve (12)
months before the date the payment would have first commenced under the Participant’s prior election. In addition, the first payment
under the new election must commence no earlier than sixty (60) months from the date when the payment would have first commenced
under the Participant’s prior election. Such change in election shall not be given effect until twelve (12) months from the date that the
change in election is delivered to the Company.
ii.Timing of Payment. Regardless of the form of payment, a Participant may elect to delay payment of his benefit provided such election
is made in writing in the form and manner determined by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, not less than twelve (12)
months before the date the payment would have first commenced under the Participant’s prior election. In addition, the first payment
under the new election must commence no earlier than sixty (60) months from when the payment would have first commenced under
the Participant’s prior election. No interest shall be paid between the date of termination of employment or attainment of age fifty-five
(55), as applicable, and the payment date. Such change in election shall not be given effect until twelve (12) months from the date that
the change in election is delivered to the Company.
This Section 1.e. does not apply to Surviving Spouses or Beneficiaries.
f.Notwithstanding the above, for periods prior to January 1, 2009 (or such later date as may be provided by the Internal Revenue Service in
guidance of general applicability), the Senior Vice President, Human Resources may provide alternative rules for elections with respect to the
commencement of payment and form of payment, provided that such rules conform to Code section 409A and Internal Revenue Service
guidance issued thereunder.
g.If a Participant participates in more than one supplemental pension plan sponsored by the Corporation, the Participant must make a single
election that shall apply to his or her benefits under all such plans
4
with respect to the form of annuity (under Section 1.a. of this Article IV) and with respect to prospective changes of payment (under Section 1.e.
of this Article IV).
2.Deductibility of Payments. Subject to the provisions of Section Code section 409A, in the event that the Company reasonably anticipates that the payment
of benefits in accordance with the Participant’s election under Section 1 would prevent the Company from claiming an income tax deduction with
respect to any portion of the benefits paid under Code section 162(m), the Committee shall have the right to delay the timing of distributions from the
Participant’s Account as necessary to maximize the Company’s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a delayed distribution schedule,
the Committee shall undertake to have distributions made at such times and in such amounts as the Company reasonably anticipates, or should
reasonably anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year, the deduction will not be barred by Code section 162(m) or upon a Termination of
Employment in accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-2(b)(7)(i), consistent with the objective of maximum deductibility for the
Company. The Committee shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’s Account Balance or to pay aggregate benefits less than the Participant’s
Account Balance in the event that all or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the Company. All scheduled payments under this Plan and any
other plan required to be aggregated with this Plan must be delayed in order for such payment to be delayed pursuant to this Section 2.

APPENDIX A TO ANNEX I
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED UNDER THE LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION SUPPLEMENTAL EXCESS
RETIREMENT PLAN
1.Introduction. The benefits described in this Appendix previously were provided as part of the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Excess
Retirement Plan. That Plan was formerly known as the Martin Marietta Corporation Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan, and included provisions
previously contained in the Lockheed Martin Supplemental Retirement Income Plan.
2.Purpose. This Appendix provides a supplemental benefit to salaried employees who were considered highly compensated employees as of December 31,
1990 and who were also participants in the Martin Marietta Corporation Retirement Income Plan as of September 30, 1975, whose benefits are limited by
Code section 401(a)(4).
3.Eligibility. This Appendix provides benefits to salaried employees who were considered highly compensated employees as of December 31, 1990 (as
determined under the Martin Marietta Corporation Retirement Income Plan as in effect on that date) and who were also covered employees in the Martin
Marietta Corporation Retirement Income Plan as of September 30, 1975 or were participants for 12 consecutive months prior to September 30, 1975 who
receive a pension benefit calculated under the Pre-ERISA formula in the Martin Marietta Corporation Retirement Income Plan.
4.Amount of Benefit. Participants shall receive a retirement benefit from this Plan that is reasonably determined by the Company to equal to the excess, if
any, of (1) the pension benefit calculated based on the formula described in Article V(1)(b) or Article IX(2)(b) of the January 1, 1995 Martin Marietta
Corporation Retirement Income Plan without regard to the limitation described in Article V(1)(c), Article IX(2)(c) or Code section 415 or Code section
401(a)(17), reduced by the greater of the pension benefits described in Article V(l)(b) or Article IX(2)(b) of the January 1, 1995 Retirement Income Plan.
To prevent duplication of benefits, the benefit payable under this Appendix shall be coordinated with any benefit payable under Article II of Annex I, as
set forth therein.
5.In no event shall the computation of benefits under this Appendix take into account any service performed by a Participant after separation from
employment with the Company or its subsidiaries.
1
APPENDIX B TO ANNEX I
GRANDFATHERED BENEFITS UNDER THE SRP COMPONENT
This Appendix B shall govern the portion of a Participant’s benefit that accrued and vested under the Plan on or before December 31, 2004. This Appendix B
shall not apply to the portion of a Participant’s benefit that accrued and vested under the Plan on or after January 1, 2005.
ARTICLE I.
EXCESS BENEFIT PROVISIONS
1.Eligibility. An Eligible Employee who is entitled to benefits under a Qualified Pension Plan, and whose retirement income benefits are limited by the
provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan (as amended from time to time) relating to the limits under Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17)
shall receive benefits pursuant to this Article I.
2.Amount of Benefit. The benefit that each Participant shall be entitled to receive is the difference between the Participant’s actual benefit under the
applicable Qualified Pension Plan and the benefits that would have been payable under that Plan if:
a.the Qualified Pension Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below; and
b.the Participant’s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan “MICP”) is included in pensionable earnings under a Qualified
Pension Plan, the Participant’s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match” basis. The Participant’s annual compensation earned
under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable earnings. The average of the three (3) highest years of MICP compensation
during the last 10 years shall be added to the average of the three (3) highest years of other pensionable earnings during the last 10 years to arrive at total
final average pensionable earnings for the applicable period under the Qualified Pension Plan.
Benefits under this Article I are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to
provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan on a “mix and match” basis
and without regard to the limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17). To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the
applicable Qualified Pension Plan shall be calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit
payable from the applicable Qualified Pension Plan, and then reduced further by the benefit payable from other nonqualified pension plans of the
Company which corresponds to the benefit payable under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan (including any benefit payable under Exhibit 2 of this
Plan and excluding any nonqualified plans designed to supplement qualified defined contribution plans). The remaining benefit shall be paid from this
Plan pursuant to this Article I. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make
such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article I shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who is receiving or entitled to receive
benefits with respect to the Participant under the Qualified Pension Plan.
If the benefits payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’ s retirement as a result of a general
increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan unless the Committee expressly so
provides in writing.
ARTICLE II.
SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS
1
In addition to the benefits described in Article I, the Plan also provides benefits to certain key management employees, as set forth in the Exhibits. Eligibility
for, and the amount of, such benefits is set forth in the applicable Exhibit. Payment options for such benefits are described in Article III.
ARTICLE III.
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1.Form of Payment. Benefits shall be paid in the same form at the same times and for the same period as benefits are paid with respect to the Participant
under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan, except as provided in the following paragraphs. Actuarial adjustments shall be based on the factors set forth
in the Qualified Pension Plan, except as provided in the following paragraphs. If the benefits payable under this Plan correspond to Qualified Pension
Plan benefits with multiple commencement dates, each portion of the benefits payable under this Plan shall be paid at the same time as the corresponding
portion of the benefits is paid from the Qualified Pension Plan. If an Employee’s benefits under the Qualified Pension Plan are suspended for any month
in accordance with the re-employment provisions thereof, the Participant’s benefit for that month shall likewise be suspended under this Plan.
Lump Sum Option. A Participant may irrevocably elect to receive a full or partial single lump sum payment in an amount which is the Actuarial
Equivalent of the benefit described above, and with no interest for the period between the date of termination of employment and the payment
date. This election must be made within the time period for electing the form of benefit under the corresponding Qualified Pension Plan, by
filing a written election in the form and manner prescribed by the Company. Payment will be made six (6) months following the date payments
would otherwise begin pursuant to the above paragraph.
Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit. In the event the Participant dies prior to the date his or her retirement has commenced under this Plan and the
corresponding Qualified Pension Plan, the pre-retirement survivor benefit payable to the surviving spouse (if any) under this Plan (the “Pre-
Retirement Survivor Benefit” and the “Surviving Spouse”) will be payable, at the election of the Surviving Spouse, in any of the following
forms:
(a)in the form of a monthly annuity payable to the Surviving Spouse for his lifetime, with no further payments to anyone after his
death (which will be referred to as the “Regular Form”);
(b)in the form of a lump sum payment which is the Actuarial Equivalent of the Regular Form (the “100% Lump Sum”), but with
Actuarial Equivalent determined as of the Election Date, and with no interest for the period between the Election Date (or, if later,
the date the Participant would have attained age 55 had he survived) and the payment date; or
(c)in the form of a combined lump sum and life annuity benefit of (x) and (y), where (x) equals a lump sum amount selected by the
Surviving Spouse which is less than the 100% Lump Sum and (y) is a monthly single life annuity for the life of Surviving Spouse
(with no further payments to anyone after his death) in an amount that can be provided with the difference between (x) and the
100% Lump Sum.
Any election to receive the benefit in the form of a lump sum as set forth in (b) above or a combined lump sum and annuity as set forth in (c)
above must be made by the Surviving Spouse no later than 90 days after the date of the Participant’s death or, if later, the date the Participant
would have attained age 55 had he survived (with the date such election is made by the Surviving Spouse referred to as the “Election Date”). In
the event the Surviving Spouse makes an election for a lump sum or partial lump sum payment within this period, payment will not be made to
the Surviving Spouse until six months after the Election Date (or, if later, six months after the date the benefit would otherwise be payable under
this Plan).
Cash-out of Small Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, if the Value of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary under this
Plan does not exceed the amount that may be distributed
2
without consent under Section 411(a)(11) of the Code, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum payment in full discharge of all
liabilities with respect to such benefits. For purposes of this Section, Value shall be determined as of the Participant’s termination of
employment, and shall mean the present value of a Participant’s or Beneficiary’s benefits based upon the applicable mortality table and
applicable interest rate in Code section 417(e)(3)(ii) for the calendar month preceding the Plan Year in which the termination of employment
occurs.
2.Deductibility of Payments. In the event that the payment of benefits under Section 1 would prevent the Company from claiming an income tax deduction
with respect to any portion of the benefits paid, the Committee shall have the right to modify the form and timing of distributions as necessary to
maximize the Company’s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a modified distribution schedule, the Committee shall undertake to
have distributions made at such times and in such amounts as most closely approximate the payment method described in Section 1, consistent with the
objective of maximum deductibility for the Company. The Committee shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’s accrued benefit under this Plan or
to pay aggregate benefits less than the Participant’s accrued benefit in the event that all or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the Company.

years.
ARTICLE I.
DEFINITIONS
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the following words and phrases when used in this Plan shall have the meanings hereinafter indicated or in the Master
Plan Document. All terms used in this Plan which are defined in the Qualified Pension Plan have the same meanings, unless otherwise expressly provided in
this Plan.
ARTICLE II.
SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION BENEFIT
1. Eligibility. Each Employee who was classified as an Executive Career Band (“EB”) employee on or prior to December 31, 1993, who has five or more
years of Vesting Service and who is a participant in the Qualified Pension Plan shall be eligible to receive benefits under this Article II. However, except as
provided in Section 2.D., an Employee who retires under the Qualified Pension Plan before the first day of the month following attainment of age 55 or an
Employee who leaves the Service of the Company before attainment of age 55, shall not be eligible for a benefit under this Article II.
An Employee who meets the other requirements specified in this Section shall be eligible for benefits under this Article II so long as his assigned position
level or position of equivalent responsibility throughout any consecutive three years of the 15-year period ending on the last day of the month preceding his
termination of service is at least at the level of a director (or other position equivalent to General Electric Company’s EB) even though he is not employed at
that level on the date his Service terminates.
2. Amount of Benefit.
A.    Definitions. For purposes of this Section 2, the following terms have the following meanings:
Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit. The annual equivalent of the maximum possible Primary Insurance Amount payable, after
reduction for early retirement, as an old-age benefit to an employee who retired at age 62 on January 1 of the calendar year in which occurred the Employee’s
actual date of retirement or death, or December 31, 2015, whichever is earlier. The Company shall determine the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit in
accordance with the Social Security Act in effect at the end of the calendar year preceding such January 1.
If an Employee has less than 35 years of Credited Service, the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit determined under the above
paragraph is multiplied by a factor, the numerator of which is the number of years of the Employees’ Credited Service to his or her date of retirement or
death, or December 31, 2019, whichever is earlier, and the denominator of which is 35.
The Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit shall be adjusted to include any social security, severance, or similar benefit provided under
foreign law or regulations as the Committee may prescribe by rules and regulations.
Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan. The sum of:
(1) (i) the annual normal, early or late retirement benefit under Article V of the Qualified Pension Plan, including the Personal
Pension Account (excluding the regular supplement under Article V(4) of the
1
Qualified Pension Plan), or (ii) the normal, optional or disability retirement benefit under the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan, less
(2)    to the extent the Committee so determines, the benefit payable under any other pension plan contract, or policy of the Plan
Sponsor (whether qualified or non qualified), or government program attributable to periods of service for which Credited Service is granted by the
Committee for the determination of the benefit under this Plan or is credited by the Qualified Pension. All such amounts shall be determined before applying
any reduction factors for Early, Optional or Disability Retirement, for election of any optional form of Pension at retirement, a qualified domestic relations
order(s), if any, or in connection with any other adjustment or supplement made pursuant to the Qualified Pension Plan or any other pension plan.
For purposes of this paragraph, the Employee’s Pension shall include the Personal Pension Account Annuity payable to the Employee or the
Employee’s spouse on the date of the Employee’s retirement or death, regardless of whether such annuity commenced on such date.
Annual Retirement Income. For Employees who retire or die in active Service on or after April 5, 1993, the amount determined by
multiplying 1.75% of Average Annual Compensation by the number of years of Credited Service completed at the date of retirement or death, or December
31, 2019, whichever is earlier.
Average Annual Compensation. One-third of the Employee’s Compensation for the highest consecutive three years during the last 10 years
immediately preceding his date of retirement or death, whichever is earlier. In computing Average Annual Compensation, normal straight-time earnings shall
be substituted for actual Compensation for any month in which such normal straight-time earnings are greater. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Average
Annual Compensation will be frozen effective as of January 1, 2016. Accordingly, for purposes of determining Average Annual Compensation, the term
“years” above shall not include any period after December 31, 2015, and Average Annual Compensation shall not include amounts earned for or relating to
any period after December 31, 2015.
Compensation. Salary (including any deferred salary approved by the Committee as compensation for purposes of this Plan) plus:
(1)    For persons then eligible for Incentive Compensation, the total amount of any Management Incentive Compensation Plan
earnings, unless such Incentive Compensation is excluded by the Board or a committee thereof;
(2)    For persons who would then have been eligible for Incentive Compensation if they had not been participants in a Sales
Commission Plan or other variable compensation plan, the total amount of sales commissions (or other variable compensation earned unless such
compensation is excluded by the Board or a committee thereof);
(3)    For all other persons, the sales commissions and other variable compensation earned to the extent such earnings were then
included under the Qualified Pension Plan, plus any amounts (other than salary and those mentioned in clauses (1) through (3) above) which were then
included as compensation under the Qualified Pension Plan except any amounts which the Committee may exclude from the computation of “Compensation”
and subject to the powers of the Committee with respect to payment of benefits.
The Committee shall specify the basis for determining an Employee’s Compensation for any portion of the three years used to compute the
Employee’s Average Annual Compensation during which the Employee was not employed by an employer participating in this Plan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Compensation will be frozen effective as of January 1, 2016. Accordingly, Compensation shall not include amounts earned for or relating to any
period after December 31, 2015.
Credited Service. Credited Service has the same meaning as in the Qualified Pension Plan. For periods before January 1, 1976, Credited
Service as a full-time Employee also includes all Service credited under the Qualified Pension Plan for any period during which the employee was a full-time
Employee for purposes of the Qualified Pension Plan. Credited Service also includes:
2
(1)    Any period of Service with the Company or an Affiliate as the Committee may otherwise provide by rules and regulations
issued with respect to this Plan; and
(2)    Any period of service with another employer as the Board may approve, if any conditions specified in such approval have
been met.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant’s Credited Service shall be frozen effective January 1, 2020, and no Participant shall accrue
further Credited Service under this Plan with respect to any period after December 31, 2019.
B.    Normal Retirement Benefit. Subject to the limitations in Section G and the requirements of Code section 409A, the benefit payable to an
eligible Employee who has a Termination of Employment on or after his or her normal retirement date under the Plan, shall be the excess, if any, of the
employee’s Annual Retirement Income, over the sum of:
(1)    The Employee’s Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan (including the Personal Pension Account Annuity and
excluding any supplements payable under the Qualified Pension Plan) (calculated as a five-year certain annuity),
(2)    1/2 of the Employee’s Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit,
(3)    the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan.
C.    Early, Optional or Disability Retirement. Subject to the limitations in Section G and Section 1 of Article VI of the Master Plan Document,
the benefit payable to an eligible Employee who, after reaching age 60, retires on an optional retirement date under the Qualified Pension Plan shall be
computed in the manner provided by Section B (for an employee retiring on his or her normal retirement date) but taking into account only Credited Service
and Average Annual Compensation to the actual date of optional retirement. The annual benefit payable to an eligible Employee who, after reaching age 55
(but before reaching age 60), retires under the early retirement provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan shall equal the amount in section B but taking into
account only Credited Service and Average Annual Compensation to the Employee’s actual Termination of Employment and reduced for early retirement
using the early retirement reduction factor under Article V(2) of the Qualified Pension Plan.
Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, the annual benefit payable to an eligible Employee who has satisfied the eligibility
requirements to receive a Disability Pension under the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan (to the extent consistent with the requirements of Code
section 409A(a)(2(C)) shall be computed in the manner provided by Section B (for an Employee retiring on his normal retirement date) taking into account
only Credited Service and Average Annual Compensation to the actual date of disability retirement and not reduced for the Disability Supplement in the RIP
II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan. In the case of an eligible Employee whose date of retirement precedes the first day of the month after reaching age
60, the Plan benefit shall then be reduced by 12%.
If the Disability Pension payable to the Employee under the Qualified Pension Plan is discontinued as a result of the Employee’s disability
ceasing before the Employee reaches age 60, the benefit provided under this Section C shall also be discontinued to the extent permitted under Code section
409A.
D.    Special Benefit Protection for Certain Employees. Subject to the provisions of Code section 409A, a former Employee whose Service with
the Company is terminated on or after December 31, 1994, and after completing 25 or more years of Vesting Service, who does not withdraw his required or
voluntary contributions from the Qualified Pension Plan before retirement, shall be eligible for a benefit under this Plan commencing upon the later of
Termination of Employment with the Company and the attainment of age 60 if:
(1)    the Employee’s Service is terminated for transfer to a successor employer and
(2)    the Employee does not retire under the Qualified Pension Plan until the later of (1) termination of service with the successor employer
and (2) the first of the month after reaching age 60.
3
In determining the benefit under this Plan, the Average Annual Compensation shall be based on the last 120 completed months with the
successor employer before the Employee’s Service termination date and the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit shall be determined as though the
Employee’s retirement date was the date of termination. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “120 completed months” shall not include any period
after December 31, 2015.
E.    Survivor Benefits. Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, if a survivor benefit applies with respect to the past and future service
annuity portion of an Employee’s Annual Pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan, such survivor benefit shall automatically apply to any benefit
which he or she may be eligible under this Plan. The Employee’s benefit shall be adjusted and paid in the same manner as such pension payable under the
Qualified Pension Plan is adjusted and paid on account of such survivor benefit. Payments to the survivor shall commence as soon as administratively
practicable (but not later than 90 days) following the later of: (1) the Employee’s 55th birthday, or (2) the Employee’s date of death.
F.    Payments Upon Death. Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, if an eligible Employee dies in active Service, or following
Termination of Employment with a benefit from this Plan, and a death benefit (other than a return of Employee contributions with interest including an
Employee’s Personal and Voluntary Pension Account) is payable to the beneficiary or Surviving Spouse of such Employee under the Qualified Pension Plan,
a death benefit shall also be payable to the beneficiary or Surviving Spouse under this Plan as follows:
(1)    Any such death benefit payable to a surviving spouse under this Plan shall equal 50% of the Employee’s Annual Retirement Income
under this Plan reduced by (1) 100% of the Employee’s preretirement surviving spouse benefit payable or other lump sum benefit under the Qualified Pension
Plan, (2) 25% of the Employee’s Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit, (3) the Employee’s Personal Pension Account benefit, and (4) the benefit payable
under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan. Payments to the surviving spouse shall commence as soon as administratively
practicable (but no later than 90 days) after the later of: (1) the Employee’s 55th birthday, or (2) the Employee’s date of death, subject to the requirements of
Code section 409A if the beneficiary or Surviving Spouse is entitled to benefits under more than one supplemental pension plan.
(2)    Any such death benefit payable to a surviving spouse under this Plan shall take into account only Credited Service and Average
Annual Compensation to the earlier of the Employee’s death or termination of employment and will be reduced for early retirement using the early retirement
reduction factors under Article V(2) of the Qualified Pension Plan.
(3)    Subject to the requirements of Code section 409A, any such benefit payable to a surviving spouse shall be paid as soon as
administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days) after the later of: (1) the Employee’s 55th birthday, or (2) the Employee’s date of death and will be
paid in accordance with the payment provisions of the RIP Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan. If benefits from the Qualified Pension Plan are paid under
the payment provisions of the RIP Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan, then benefits from this Plan will be paid in the same payment form.
G.    Limitations on Benefits.
(a)    Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the sum of:
(1)The annual benefit (calculated before applying any reductions for early retirement or additions for any supplements payable under the
Qualified Pension Plan, and prior to any calculation for disability retirement reductions) otherwise payable to an Employee under this Plan;
(2)The Employee’s Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan (including the Personal Pension Account Annuity)
(calculated as a five-year certain annuity);
(3)100% of the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit before any adjustment for less than 35 years of Pension Benefit Service;
4
(4)the Employee’s annual benefit under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan; and
to the extent the Committee so determines, the benefit payable under any other pension plan contract, or policy of the Plan Sponsor (whether
qualified or non-qualified), or government program attributable to periods of service for which Credited Service is granted by the Committee for the
determination of the benefit under this Plan or is credited by the Qualified Pension exceeds 60% of his or her Annual Average Compensation, the benefit
payable under this Plan shall be reduced by the amount of the excess, to the extent permitted by Code section 409A.
(b)    Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, the amount of the benefit payable and any death benefit payable to or on behalf
of any Employee who is or was an Officer of the Company on the date of his Termination of Employment or death, whichever is earlier, shall be determined
according to such general rules and regulations as a Committee appointed by the Board of Directors may adopt, subject to the limitation that any such benefit
or death benefit may not exceed the amount which would be payable under this Plan in the absence of such rules and regulations.
H.    Adjustments Following Retirement. If the Pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Employee is increased following the
Employee’s retirement as a result of a general increase in the Pensions payable to retired employees under that plan, no such increase will be made under this
Plan.
I.    Non-duplication of Benefits. Benefits under this Article II are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit under the Qualified
Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the Qualified Pension Plan with the
special adjustments described above. To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced benefit described
above shall be calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified
Pension Plan and further reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan, then reduced by the
Grandfathered 2004 Benefit, to the extent permitted by Code section 409A. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of
service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
ARTICLE III.
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1.Form of Payment. All elections under this Section 1 must be made in the form and manner prescribed by the Senior Vice President, Human
Resources. No election made pursuant to this Section 1 may affect a payment due in the same calendar year in which the election is made or accelerate
payment into the calendar year in which the election is made. No lump sum distributions are available under this Plan. Benefits under this Plan shall be paid
in the form of an annuity commencing as soon as administratively practicable (but no more than 90 days) following the later of (i) the month in which the
Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
benefits paid to a Participant who is reasonably determined by the Company to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code section 409A(2)(B)(i),
shall not commence before the later of (i) six (6) months following the month in which the Participant has Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in
which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55),
as applicable, and the payment date.
Selection of Annuity Form. To the extent permitted under Code section 409A, prior to his Termination of Employment or attainment of age 55, as
applicable, a Participant may elect to receive benefits in any actuarially equivalent annuity form that is available under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan
on the date of the Participant’s election that has been designated by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources as available for election under this Plan. If
the Participant has not validly elected an annuity form before his Termination of Employment or attainment of age 55, as applicable, (i) an unmarried
Participant shall be deemed to have elected payment in the form of a monthly annuity for the life of the Participant with no further payments to anyone after
his or her death, and (ii) a married Participant shall be deemed to have elected payment in the form of a reduced monthly annuity for the life of
5
the Participant with, after the Participant’s death, a 50% survivor annuity for the life of the Participant’s spouse. Actuarial adjustments shall be based on the
factors set forth in the Qualified Pension Plan.
Cash-out of Small Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, if the Value of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary under this Plan
does not exceed $10,000, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum payment in full discharge of all liabilities with respect to such benefits. For
purposes of this Section, Value shall be determined as of the Participant’s Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and
shall mean the present value of a Participant’s or Beneficiary’s benefits, excluding the Grandfathered 2004 Benefit, based (i) for Terminations prior to January
1, 2008, upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate in Code section 417(e)(3)(ii), or (ii) for terminations on or after January 1, 2008, upon
the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate under Code section 417(e)(3), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, for the calendar
month preceding the Plan Year in which the Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55) occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
benefits paid under this Section 1 to a Participant who is reasonably determined by the Company to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code
section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), shall not commence before the later of (i) six (6) months following the month in which the Participant Terminates Employment, or
(ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of Employment or attainment of
age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date.
Prospective Elections. Participants may elect to further delay the commencement of benefits as provided in this paragraph. This paragraph does not
apply to Surviving Spouses or Beneficiaries. A new election under this section shall be made by executing and delivering to the Company an election in such
form as prescribed by the Company. To constitute a valid election by a Participant making a prospective change to a previous election, (i) the prospective
election must be executed and delivered to the Company at least twelve (12) months before the date the first payment would be due under the Participant’s
previous election, and (ii) the first payment must be delayed by at least sixty (60) months from the date the first payment would be due under the Participant’s
previous election, and (iii) such change in election shall not be given effect until twelve (12) months from the date that the change in election is delivered to
the Company. In the event an election fails to satisfy the provisions set forth in this paragraph, such election shall be void and, if such an election is void,
payment shall be made in accordance with the most recent election which was valid. Other changes in the form of benefit may be made only as determined by
the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, of the Company in accordance with Code section 409A.
If a Participant participates in more than one supplemental pension plan sponsored by the Company, the Participant must make a single election with
respect to the form of annuity that shall apply to his or her benefits under all such plans and with respect to prospective changes of payment under this Section
1 of Article III.
Notwithstanding the above, for periods prior to January 1, 2009, (or such later date as may be provided by the Internal Revenue Service in guidance
of general applicability), the Senior Vice President, Human Resources may provide alternative rules for elections with respect to the commencement of
payment and form of payment, provided that such rules conform to Code section 409A and Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder.
2.Deductibility of Payments. Subject to the provisions of Section Code section 409A, in the event that the Company reasonably anticipates that the
payment of benefits in accordance with the Participant’s election under Section 1 would prevent the Company from claiming an income tax deduction with
respect to any portion of the benefits paid under Code section 162(m), the Committee shall have the right to delay the timing of distributions from the
Participant’s Account as necessary to maximize the Company’s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a delayed distribution schedule, the
Committee shall undertake to have distributions made at such times and in such amounts as the Company reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably
anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year, the deduction will not be barred by Code section 162(m) or upon a Termination of Employment in
accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-2(b)(7)(i), consistent with the objective of maximum deductibility for the Company. The Committee
shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’s Account Balance or to pay aggregate benefits less than the Participant’s Account Balance in the event that all
or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the Company. All scheduled payments under this Plan and any other plan required to be aggregated with this
Plan must be delayed in order for such payment to be delayed pursuant to this Section 2.

shall not apply to the portion of a Participant’s benefit that accrued and vested under the Plan on or after January 1, 2005.
ARTICLE I.
SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION BENEFIT
1.Eligibility. Each Employee who was classified as an Executive Career Band (“EB”) employee on or prior to December 31, 1993, who has five or more
years of Vesting Service and who is a participant in the Qualified Pension Plan shall be eligible to receive benefits under this Article I. However, except as
provided in Section 2.D., an Employee who retires under the Qualified Pension Plan before the first day of the month following attainment of age 55 or an
Employee who leaves the Service of the Company before attainment of age 55, shall not be eligible for a benefit under this Article I.
An Employee who meets the other requirements specified in this Section shall be eligible for benefits under this Article I, so long as his assigned
position level or position of equivalent responsibility throughout any consecutive three years of the 15 year period ending on the last day of the month
preceding his termination of service is at least at the level of a director (or other position equivalent to General Electric Company’s EB) even though he is not
employed at that level on the date his Service terminates.
2.Amount of Benefit.
A.Definitions. For purposes of this Section 2, the following terms have the following meanings:
Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit. The annual equivalent of the maximum possible Primary Insurance Amount payable, after
reduction for early retirement, as an old-age benefit to an employee who retired at age 62 on January 1 of the calendar year in which occurred the Employee’s
actual date of retirement or death, whichever is earlier. The Company shall determine the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit in accordance with the
Social Security Act in effect at the end of the calendar year preceding such January 1.
If an Employee has less than 35 years of Credited Service, the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit determined under the above
paragraph is multiplied by a factor, the numerator of which is the number of years of the Employees’ Credited Service to his or her date of retirement or
death, or December 31, 2019, whichever is earlier, and the denominator of which is 35.
The Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit shall be adjusted to include any social security, severance, or similar benefit provided under
foreign law or regulations as the Committee may prescribe by rules and regulations.
Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan. The sum of:
(1)    (i) the annual normal, early or late retirement benefit under Article V of the Qualified Pension Plan, including the Personal
Pension Account (excluding the regular supplement under Article V(4) of the Qualified Pension Plan), or (ii) the normal, optional or disability retirement
benefit under the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan, less
(2)    to the extent the Committee so determines, the benefit payable under any other pension plan contract, or policy of the Plan
Sponsor (whether qualified or non-qualified), or government program attributable to periods of service for which Credited Service is granted by the
Committee for the determination of the benefit under this Plan or is credited by the Qualified Pension. All such amounts shall be determined before applying
any reduction factors for Early, Optional or Disability Retirement, for election of any optional form of Pension at retirement, a qualified domestic relations
order(s), if any, or in connection with any other adjustment or supplement made pursuant to the Qualified Pension Plan or any other pension plan.
For purposes of this paragraph, the Employee’s Pension shall include the Personal Pension Account Annuity payable to the Employee or the
Employee’s spouse on the date of the Employee’s retirement or death, regardless of whether such annuity commenced on such date.
Annual Retirement Income. For Employees who retire or die in active Service on or after April 5, 1993, the amount determined by
multiplying 1.75% of Average Annual Compensation by the number of years of Credited Service completed at the date of retirement or death, or December
31, 2019, whichever is earlier.
1
Average Annual Compensation. One-third of the Employee’s Compensation for the highest consecutive three years during the last 10 years
immediately preceding his date of retirement or death, whichever is earlier. In computing Average Annual Compensation, normal straight-time earnings shall
be substituted for actual Compensation for any month in which such normal straight-time earnings are greater. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Average
Annual Compensation will be frozen effective as of January 1, 2016. Accordingly, for purposes of determining Average Annual Compensation, the term
“years” above shall not include any period after December 31, 2015, and Average Annual Compensation shall not include amounts earned for or relating to
any period after December, 31, 2015.

Commission Plan or other variable compensation plan, the total amount of sales commissions (or other variable compensation earned unless such
compensation is excluded by the Board or a committee thereof);
(3)    For all other persons, the sales commissions and other variable compensation earned to the extent such earnings were then
included under the Qualified Pension Plan, plus any amounts (other than salary and those mentioned in clauses (1) through (3) above) which were then
included as compensation under the Qualified Pension Plan except any amounts which the Committee may exclude from the computation of “Compensation”
and subject to the powers of the Committee with respect to payment of benefits.
The Committee shall specify the basis for determining an Employee’s Compensation for any portion of the three years used to compute the
Employee’s Average Annual Compensation during which the Employee was not employed by an employer participating in this Plan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Compensation will be frozen effective as of January 1, 2016. Accordingly, Compensation shall not include amounts earned for or relating to any
period after December 31, 2015.
Credited Service. Credited Service has the same meaning as in the Qualified Pension Plan. For periods before January 1, 1976, Credited
Service as a full-time Employee also includes all Service credited under the Qualified Pension Plan for any period during which the employee was a full-time
Employee for purposes of the Qualified Pension Plan. Credited Service also includes:
(1)    Any period of Service with the Company or an Affiliate as the Committee may otherwise provide by rules and regulations issued
with respect to this Plan; and
(2)    Any period of service with another employer as the Board may approve, if any conditions specified in such approval have been
met.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant’s Credited Service shall be frozen effective January 1, 2020, and no Participant shall accrue
further Credited Service under this Plan with respect to any period after December 31, 2019.
B.Normal Retirement Benefit. Subject to the limitations in Section G, the benefit payable to an eligible Employee who retires on or after his or her
normal retirement date under the Plan, shall be the excess, if any, of the employee’s Annual Retirement Income, over the sum of:
(1)    The Employee’s Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan (including the Personal Pension Account Annuity and
excluding any supplements payable under the Qualified Pension Plan) (calculated as a five-year certain annuity),
(2)    1/2 of the Employee’s Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit,
(3)    the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan.
C.Early, Optional or Disability Retirement. Subject to the limitations in Section G, the benefit payable to an eligible Employee who, after reaching
age 60, retires on an optional retirement date under the Qualified Pension Plan shall be computed in the manner provided by Section B (for an employee
retiring on his or her normal retirement date) but taking into account only Credited Service and Average Annual Compensation to the actual date of optional
retirement. The annual benefit payable to an eligible Employee who, after reaching age 55 (but before reaching age 60) retires under
2
the early retirement provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan shall equal the amount in section B but taking into account only Credited Service and Average
Annual Compensation to the Employee’s actual termination of employment and reduced for early retirement using the early retirement reduction factor under
Article V(2) of the Qualified Pension Plan.
The annual benefit payable to an eligible Employee who has satisfied the eligibility requirements to receive a Disability Pension under the RIP II
Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan shall be computed in the manner provided by Section B (for an Employee retiring on his normal retirement date) taking
into account only Credited Service and Average Annual Compensation to the actual date of disability retirement and not reduced for the Disability
Supplement in the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan. In the case of an eligible Employee whose date of retirement precedes the first day of the
month after reaching age 60 the Plan benefit shall then be reduced by 12%.
If the Disability Pension payable to the Employee under the Qualified Pension Plan is discontinued as a result of the Employee’s disability ceasing
before the Employee reaches age 60, the benefit provided under this Section C. shall also be discontinued.
D.Special Benefit Protection for Certain Employees. A former Employee whose Service with the Company is terminated on or after December 31,
1994, and after completing 25 or more years of Vesting Service, who does not withdraw his required or voluntary contributions from the Qualified Pension
Plan before retirement, shall be eligible for a benefit under this Plan commencing upon his or her retirement under the Qualified Pension Plan after reaching
age 60 if:
(1)    the Employee’s Service is terminated for transfer to a successor employer and
(2)    the Employee does not retire under the Qualified Pension Plan until the later of (1) termination of service with the successor employer
and (2) the first of the month after reaching age 60.
In determining the benefit under this Plan, the Average Annual Compensation shall be based on the last 120 completed months with the successor
employer before the Employee’s Service termination date and the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit shall be determined as though the Employee’s
retirement date was the date of termination. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “120 completed months” shall not include any period after December
31, 2015.
E.Survivor Benefits. Subject to Section F(b), if a survivor benefit applies with respect to the past and future service annuity portion of an
Employee’s Annual Pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan, such survivor benefit shall automatically apply to any benefit which he or she may be
eligible under this Plan. The Employee’s benefit shall be adjusted and paid in the same manner as such pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan is
adjusted and paid on account of such survivor benefit.
F. Payments Upon Death.
(a)    If an eligible Employee dies in active Service, or following retirement with a benefit from this Plan, and a death benefit (other than a return
of Employee contributions with interest including an Employee’s Personal and Voluntary Pension Account) is payable to the beneficiary or Surviving Spouse
of such Employee under the Qualified Pension Plan, a death benefit shall also be payable to the beneficiary or Surviving Spouse under this Plan as follows:
(1)    Any such death benefit payable to a surviving spouse under this Plan shall equal 50% of the Employee’s Annual Retirement
Income under this Plan reduced by (1) 100% of the Employee’s preretirement surviving spouse benefit payable or other lump sum benefit under the Qualified
Pension Plan, (2) 25% of the Employee’s Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit, (3) the Employee’s Personal Pension Account benefit, and (4) the benefit
payable under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan. Payments to the surviving spouse shall commence on the later of: (1) the
Employee’s 55th birthday, or (2) the Employee’s date of death.
(2)    Any such death benefit payable to a surviving spouse under this Plan shall take into account only Credited Service and
Average Annual Compensation to the earlier of the Employee’s death or termination of employment and will be reduced for early retirement using the early
retirement reduction factors under Article V(2) of the Qualified Pension Plan.
(3)    Any such benefit payable to a surviving spouse shall be paid at the same time as the Qualified Pension Plan and will be paid
in accordance with the payment provisions of the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan. If benefits from the Qualified Pension Plan are paid under the
payment provisions of the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan, then benefits from this Plan will be paid in the same payment form.
(b)    In lieu of the benefit otherwise payable to a beneficiary or surviving spouse under Section E. or paragraph (a) of this Section, an Employee
may elect to have all or any portion of such benefit (or the equivalent value of all or any portion) paid to the beneficiary designated in the employee’s election
in any of the following forms:
3
(1)    An annuity for the spouse’s remaining lifetime. If the beneficiary dies before the spouse, the remaining benefit shall be paid
as provided in the employee’s election. In the absence of any such provision, the equivalent value of the remaining payments shall be paid to the beneficiary’s
estate, if any, otherwise to the beneficiary’s Personal Representative.
(2)    An annuity for the beneficiary’s remaining lifetime. If any annuity otherwise payable under this item (2) is less than $5,000
annually, the equivalent value shall be paid instead to the beneficiary in a lump sum.
(3)    A lump sum.
Any such election must be made in writing to the Qualified Pension Plan Administrator prior to the Employee’s death, and becomes
effective when the Qualified Pension Plan Administrator receives it. For purposes of this election, an Employee may designate as his beneficiary only his
estate, his former spouse, or a member of his immediate family.
For the purpose of determining the benefit conversions required to provide the benefit payments referred to above, the interest rate
assumption shall be the interest rate used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation at the beginning of the year in which the Employee’s death occurs, in
valuing immediate annuities for terminating single employer trusteed plans, and the mortality assumption shall be based on the UP-1984 Mortality Table.
G.Limitations on Benefits.
(a)    Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the sum of:
(1)    The annual benefit (calculated before applying any reductions for early retirement or additions for any supplements payable under
the Qualified Pension Plan, and prior to any calculation for disability retirement reductions) otherwise payable to an Employee under this Plan;
(2)    The Employee’s Annual Pension Payable under the Qualified Pension Plan (including the Personal Pension Account Annuity)
(calculated as a five-year certain annuity);
(3)    100% of the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit before any adjustment for less than 35 years of Pension Benefit Service;
(4)    the Employee’s annual benefit under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan; and
to the extent the Committee so determines, the benefit payable under any other pension plan contract, or policy of the Plan Sponsor (whether
qualified or non-qualified), or government program attributable to periods of service for which Credited Service is granted by the Committee for the
determination of the benefit under this Plan or is credited by the Qualified Pension exceeds 60% of his or her Annual Average Compensation, the benefit
payable under this Plan shall be reduced by the amount of the excess.
(b)    Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, the amount of the benefit payable and any death benefit payable to or on behalf
of any Employee who is or was an Officer of the Company on the date of his retirement or death, whichever is earlier, shall be determined according to such
general rules and regulations as a Committee appointed by the Board of Directors may adopt, subject to the limitation that any such benefit or death benefit
may not exceed the amount which would be payable under this Plan in the absence of such rules and regulations.
H.Adjustments Following Retirement. If the Pension payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Employee is increased following the
Employee’s retirement as a result of a general increase in the Pensions payable to retired employees under that plan, no such increase will be made under this
Plan unless the Committee makes such determination.
I.Non-duplication of Benefits. Benefits under this Article I are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit under the Qualified Pension
Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the Qualified Pension Plan with the special
adjustments described above. To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced benefit described above
shall be calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified Pension Plan
and further reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan. Participants have no right to duplicate
benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the
4
Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
ARTICLE II.
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1. Form of Payment. Benefits shall be paid at the same time as the Qualified Pension Plan and will be paid in accordance with the payment provisions of
the RIP II Annex of the Qualified Pension Plan. If benefits from the Qualified Pension Plan are paid under the payment provisions of the RIP II Annex, then
benefits from this Plan will be paid in the same payment form.
If an Employee’s pension benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan is suspended for any month in accordance with the re-employment provisions
thereof, the Employee’s benefit under this Plan for that month shall likewise be suspended.
Cash-out of Small Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, if the Value of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary under this Plan
does not exceed the amount that may be distributed without consent under Section 411(a)(11) of the Code, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum
payment in full discharge of all liabilities with respect to such benefits. For purposes of this Section, Value shall be determined as of the Participant’s
termination of employment, and shall mean the present value of a Participant’s or Beneficiary’s benefits based upon the applicable mortality table and
applicable interest rate in Code section 417(e)(3)(ii) for the calendar month preceding the Plan Year in which the termination of employment occurs.
2.        Deductibility of Payments. In the event that the payment of benefits under Section 1 would prevent the Company from claiming an income tax
deduction with respect to any portion of the benefits paid, the Committee shall have the right to modify the form and timing of distributions as necessary to
maximize the Company’s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a modified distribution schedule, the Committee shall undertake to have
distributions made at such times and in such amounts as most closely approximate the payment method described in Section 1, consistent with the objective
of maximum deductibility for the Company. The Committee shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’s accrued benefit under this Plan or to pay
aggregate benefits less than the Participant’s accrued benefit in the event that all or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the Company.

APPENDIX III
THE LMC TRANSFER COMPONENT
The purposes of the LMC Transfer Component are (a) to provide an additional retirement benefit for certain employees whose regular retirement benefits
have been limited as a result of employment service at a Lockheed Martin company that does not have a Qualified Pension Plan; (b) to provide an additional
retirement benefit for certain employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 at a Lockheed Martin company that has a Qualified Pension Plan that is frozen to
new participants as of such date; and (c) to provide the above employees with those benefits that cannot be paid from the tax-qualified plans of Lockheed
Martin Corporation and its subsidiaries because of the limitations on contributions and benefits contained in Internal Revenue Code sections 415 and 401(a)
(17).
ARTICLE I.
DEFINITIONS
Unless the context indicates otherwise or the term is defined below or in the Master Plan Document, all terms shall be defined in accordance with the
Lockheed Martin Corporation Salaried Employee Retirement Program.
ARTICLE II.
TRANSFER BENEFITS
1. Eligibility. Benefits pursuant to this Article II are available to employees of the Company who:
(a) are Members of the Qualified Pension Plan, and
(i) are transferred, prior to July 1, 2014 to a Participating Company that does not have a Qualified Pension Plan, and
(ii) are identified by such Participating Company as a key employee at the time of such transfer, and
(iii) are designated in writing, prior to July 1, 2014, by the Committee as a Participant in this Plan;
(b) effective January 1, 2006, are not Members of the Qualified Pension Plan, and
(i) are hired by a Participating Company on or after January 1, 2006 and before July 1,2014, and
(ii) are Vice Presidents (Level 8) or above on their date of hire, or are promoted to Vice President (Level 8) after their date of hire
and before July 1, 2014, and
(iii) are not hired by a Participating Company pursuant to the Company’s acquisition of an entity that does not sponsor a qualified
defined benefit pension plan.
A “Participating Company” is a business unit designated in writing by the Committee as a unit participating in this Plan. A list of
Participating Companies is set forth in Schedule 1.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no employee of the Company shall become a Participant in the Plan on or after July 1, 2014.
2. Amount of Benefit. The benefit that each Participant shall be entitled to receive under the Plan is the amount reasonably determined by the
Company to be the difference between the Participant’s actual benefit, if any, under the Qualified Pension Plan and the benefits that would have been payable
under that Plan, subject to the offset below, if:
1
(a)    the Qualified Pension Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below;
(b)    the Participant’s period of employment service as a Participant at a Participating Company at which no Credited Service is earned was
deemed to be years of Credited Service under the Qualified Pension Plan; and
(c)    the Participant’s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable earnings under the
Qualified Pension Plan, the Participant’s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match” basis. The Participant’s annual compensation
earned under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable earnings. The average of the three (3) highest years of MICP
compensation during the last 10 years shall be added to the average of the three (3) highest years of other pensionable earnings during the last 10 years to
arrive at total final average pensionable earnings for the applicable period under the Qualified Pension Plan.
The above benefit (the “Transfer Benefit”) shall be offset by the benefits payable on behalf of the Participant under the Lockheed Martin Corporation
Capital Accumulation Plan (the “Lockheed Martin CAP”) and under the Lockheed Martin Account Balance Retirement Plan (“ABRP”). In calculating the
offset, the Participant’s total account balance as of the earlier of termination of employment or December 31, 2019 from the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be
converted into an annuity using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table and shall be calculated as of the Participant’s termination of employment, using the
PBGC immediate interest rate for lump sums rate plus 1% and the Participant’s age on the date of distribution. If the Participant received any prior
distributions from the Lockheed Martin CAP, the Transfer Benefit shall be reduced by the annuity value of the prior distribution, using the Lockheed Martin
CAP distribution amount, the PBGC interest rate plus 1% and Participant’s age on the date of distribution. The Transfer Benefit is then reduced for the
amount of the normal retirement benefit from the ABRP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective for terminations from active service and pre-retirement
deaths on or after July 1, 2015, the offset and prior distribution reduction described above each shall be converted into an annuity using the applicable
mortality table under Code section 417(e)(3); provided that if use of the applicable mortality table under Code section 417(e)(3) results in an annuity that is
more than the annuity calculated using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction, as determined at the time benefits become payable
pursuant to Article IV, then the annuity shall be calculated using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction.
Combined benefits under this Article II, the Lockheed Martin CAP and the ABRP are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit under
the Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the Qualified Pension Plan
on a “mix and match” basis, without regard to the limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), and with the special adjustments described
above. To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced Transfer Benefit described above shall be
calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified Pension Plan (without
regard to the portion of such benefit attributable to employee contributions, if any), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin CAP (as of
the earlier of termination of employment or December 31, 2019) and ABRP, and then reduced by the 2004 Grandfathered Benefit, to the extent permissible
under Code section 409A. The remainder of the benefit shall be paid from this Plan. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same
period of service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of
benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article II shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who is receiving or entitled to receive
benefits with respect to the Participant under the Qualified Pension Plan.
If the benefits payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’s retirement as a result or a general
increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan.

ARTICLE III.
INCENTIVE BENEFITS
1.Eligibility. Benefits pursuant to this Article III are available to the employees described below. However, an employee who terminated employment
with Lockheed Corporation prior to January 1, 1984, when eligible for a deferred retirement benefit under Section 5.03 of the Lockheed Retirement Plan for
Certain Salaried Employees is not eligible to receive a benefit under this Article III.
An employee or former employee of Lockheed Martin Corporation and its subsidiaries who, prior to July 2, 2014:
(a) is employed by a Lockheed Martin business unit that is not covered by a Qualified Pension Plan, and
(b) is identified by such business unit as a key employee, and
(c) at the time of eligibility for benefits is, or for any year during his or her last ten (10) years of service with Lockheed Martin
Corporation prior to July 1, 2014 was, a participant in the Lockheed Martin Corporation Management Incentive Compensation Plan (including the Deferred
Management Incentive Compensation Plan of Lockheed Martin Corporation), or any incentive compensation plan of any subsidiary or affiliated corporation
of Lockheed Martin Corporation which the Committee determines is a corresponding incentive plan; and
(d) who has been specifically designated in writing before July 1, 2014 by the Committee as a Participant; and
(e) who is not eligible for a benefit under Article II of this Plan
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no employee of the Company shall become a Participant in the Plan on or after July 1, 2014.
2. Amount of Benefit.
A.    Normal or Disability Retirement. The benefit payable under this Article III to a Participant is the amount reasonably determined to be the
difference between the Participant’s actual benefit under the Lockheed Martin Retirement Plan for Certain Salaried Employees (or such other Qualified
Pension Plan as designated by the Committee (the “Designated Qualified Plan”)) and the benefits that would have been payable under that Plan, subject to
the offset below, if:
(a) the Designated Qualified Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis as defined below;
(b) the Participant’s period of employment service as a Participant with the Company during which period no Credited Service is earned
either because the Participant was not in a covered group or because of a limitation on Credited Service under the Qualified Pension, was deemed to be years
of Credited Service under the Designated Qualified Pension Plan; and
(c) the Participant’s benefit under the Designated Qualified Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)
(17).
If a Participant’s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable earnings under the
Qualified Pension Plan, the Participant’s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match” basis. The Participant’s annual compensation
earned under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable earnings. The average of the highest years of MICP compensation shall
be added to the average of the highest years of other pensionable earnings to arrive at total final average pensionable earnings for the applicable period under
the Qualified Pension Plan.
3
The above benefit (the “Incentive Benefit”) shall be offset by the benefits payable on behalf of the Participant under the Lockheed Martin
Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan (the “Lockheed Martin CAP”) and under the Lockheed Martin Account Balance Retirement Plan (“ABRP”). In
calculating the offset, the Participant’s total account balance from the Lockheed Martin CAP as of the earlier of termination of employment or December 31,
2019 shall be converted into an annuity using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table and shall be calculated as of the Participant’s termination of
employment, using the PBGC immediate interest rate for lump sums rate plus 1% and Participant’s age on the date of distribution. If the Participant received
any prior distributions from the Lockheed Martin CAP, the Incentive Benefit shall be reduced by the annuity value of the prior distribution, using the
Lockheed Martin CAP distribution amount. PBGC immediate interest rate for lump sums rate plus 1% and Participant’s age on the date of distribution. The
Incentive Benefit is then reduced for the amount of the Participant’s normal retirement benefit from the ABRP, and then reduced by the Participant’s 2004
Grandfathered Benefit, to the extent permissible under Code section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective for terminations from active service and
pre retirement deaths on or after July 1, 2015, the offset and prior distribution reduction described above each shall be converted into an annuity using the
applicable mortality table under Code section 417(e)(3); provided that if use of the applicable mortality table under Code section 417(e)(3) results in an
annuity that is more than the annuity calculated using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction, as determined at the time benefits become
payable pursuant to Article IV, then the annuity shall be calculated using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table with sex distinction.
B. No Duplication. Combined benefits under this Article III, the Lockheed Martin CAP and the ABRP are intended to supplement the Participant’s
actual benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the
Qualified Pension Plan on a “mix and match” basis, without regard to the limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), and with the special
adjustments described above. To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced Incentive Benefit
described above shall be calculated without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the
Qualified Pension Plan then reduced by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin CAP (as of the earlier of termination of employment or December 31,
2019) and ABRP, and then reduced by the Participant’s 2004 Grandfathered Benefit, to the extent permissible under Code section 409A. The remainder of the
benefit shall be paid from this Plan. Participants have no right to duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make
such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article III shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who would be entitled to receive
benefits with respect to the Participant under the Designated Qualified Plan.
If the benefits that would be payable under the Designated Qualified Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’s retirement as
a result of a general increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan.
ARTICLE IV.
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
1.Form and Timing of Payment. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Participant may make an initial payment election between an annuity and a
lump sum payment under the terms and conditions described in this Section 1. All elections under this Section 1 must be made in the form and manner
prescribed by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources. No election made pursuant to this Section 1 may affect a payment due in the same calendar year
in which the election is made or accelerate payment into the calendar year in which the election is made.
(a)    Regular Form. Unless a Participant has elected a lump sum payment under Section 1(b) of this Article IV, benefits under this Plan shall
be paid in the form of an annuity. Participants who first become eligible for participation in the Plan after December 16, 2005 shall receive their benefits in
the form of an annuity. Benefits paid in a form described in this Section 1(a) shall commence as soon as administratively practicable (but no more than 90
days) following the later of (i) the month in which the Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the
4
month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, benefits paid in a form described in this Section 1(a) to a
Participant who is reasonably determined by the Company to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code section 409A(2)(B)(i), shall not
commence before the later of (i) six (6) months following the month in which the Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the
Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as
applicable, and the payment date.
(i)    Selection of Annuity Form. Prior to his Termination of Employment or attainment of age 55, as applicable, a Participant may
elect to receive benefits in any actuarially equivalent annuity form that is available under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan on the date of the Participant’s
election that has been designated by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources as available for election under this Plan. If the Participant has not validly
elected an annuity form before his Termination of Employment or attainment of age 55, as applicable, under this Section 1(a) or a lump sum payment as
provided in Section 1(b) of Article IV, (i) an unmarried Participant shall be deemed to have elected payment in the form of a monthly annuity for the life of
the Participant with no further payments to anyone after his or her death, and (ii) a married Participant shall be deemed to have elected payment in the form of
a reduced monthly annuity for the life of the Participant with, after the Participant’s death, a 50% survivor annuity for the life of the Participant’s spouse.
Actuarial adjustments shall be based on the factors set forth in the Qualified Pension Plan.
(b)    Lump Sum Option. This Section shall not apply to Participants who first become eligible for participation in the Plan after December 16,
2005. In lieu of the forms described in Section 1(a) of Article IV, a Participant may make a one-time initial election to receive a full lump sum payment in an
amount which is the Actuarial Equivalent of a monthly annuity for the life of the Participant with no further payments to anyone after his or her death,
provided the election is filed with the Company in writing no later than December 31, 2008 (or such other date determined by the Senior Vice President,
Human Resources and communicated to Participants) and the Participant’s employment has not terminated employment prior to filing the election. For all
Participants who elect a lump sum under this Section 1(b), the lump sum payment shall be made six (6) months following the later of (i) the month in which
the Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty five (55). No interest shall be paid between the
date of Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date. All elections under this Section 1(b) must be
made in the form and manner prescribed by the Company. Such election shall be irrevocable except as provided in Section 1(e) of Article IV.
(c)    Cash-out of Small Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, if the Value of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary
under this Plan does not exceed $10,000, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum payment in full discharge of all liabilities with respect to such
benefits. For purposes of this Section, Value shall be determined as of the Participant’s Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as
applicable, and shall mean the present value of a Participant’s or Beneficiary’s benefits, excluding the Grandfathered 2004 Benefit, based (i) for terminations
prior to January 1, 2008, upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate in Code section 417(e)(3)(ii), or (ii) for Terminations of Employment
on or after January 1, 2008, upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate under Code section 417(e)(3), as amended by the Pension
Protection Act of 2006, for the calendar month preceding the Plan Year in which the Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55) occurs.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, benefits paid under this Section 1(c) to a Participant who is reasonably determined by the Company to be a
“specified employee” within the meaning of Code section 409A(2)(B)(i), shall not commence before six (6) months following the later of (i) the month in
which the Participant has a Termination of Employment, or (ii) the month in which the Participant attains age fifty-five (55). No interest shall be paid between
the date of Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five (55), as applicable, and the payment date.
(d)    Payment Upon Death or Disability.
5
(i)    Death. No other death benefits are provided under this Plan other than as specified in this Section 1(d)(i).
A.     Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit. In the event the Participant dies prior to Termination of Employment or the
attainment of age fifty-five (55), a pre-retirement survivor benefit will be payable to the Participant’s surviving spouse (if any) (the “Pre-Retirement Survivor
Benefit” and the “Surviving Spouse”) in the form elected by the Participant under the terms of the Plan. If the Participant’s benefit was payable in a lump
sum, the lump sum shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of a monthly annuity payable for the life of the Surviving Spouse with no further payments to anyone
after his or her death. The Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit shall commence as soon as administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days) following the
later of (i) the month in which the Participant dies, or (ii) the month in which the Participant would have attained age fifty-five (55).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to all Participants who validly elected a lump sum under Section 1(b), a lump
sum Pre Retirement Survivor Benefit shall be paid to the Participant’s Surviving Spouse six (6) months following the later of (i) the month in which the
Participant dies, or (ii) the month in which the Participant would have attained age fifty-five (55). No Pre Retirement Survivor Benefit is payable to anyone
other than the Participant’s Surviving Spouse.
B.     Death After Termination of Employment or Attainment of Age 55. If a Participant who is required to wait six (6)
months for a lump sum payment (in accordance with Section 1 of Article IV) dies after the Participant’s Termination of Employment or attainment of age
fifty-five (55), as applicable, but before payment is made, the lump sum payment shall be made to the Participant’s Beneficiary as soon as administratively
practicable (but no later than 90 days) following the death of the Participant.
(ii)    Disability. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article IV, the benefit of a Disabled Participant who is eligible for a disability
pension from the Lockheed Martin Retirement Income Plan or the Lockheed Martin Corporation Retirement Income Plan III shall be paid in the form elected
by the Participant under the terms of the Plan as soon as administratively practicable (but no later than 90 days) following the date the Participant is
reasonably determined by the Company to be Disabled. For the purposes of this Section 1(d)(ii), the terms “Disabled” or “Disability” shall have the meaning
set forth in the Lockheed Martin Retirement Income Plan or the Lockheed Martin Corporation Retirement Income Plan III, as applicable, to the extent
consistent with the requirements of Code section 409A(a)(2)(C).
(e)    Prospective Change of Payment Elections. Participants may elect to change the form of payment of benefits or further delay the commencement
of benefits as provided in this Section 1(e). All elections under this Section 1(e) must be made in the form and manner prescribed by the Company. This
Section 1(e) does not apply to Surviving Spouses or Beneficiaries. Subject to the provisions of Code section 409A, other changes in the form of benefit,
including changes between actuarially equivalent forms of benefit, if any, may be made only as determined by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources,
of the Company in accordance with Code section 409A.
(i)    Form of Payment. A Participant who has validly elected (or deemed to have elected) payment as an annuity (as described in
Section 1(a) of Article IV) or has validly elected a lump sum payment (in accordance with Section 1(b) of Article IV) may later elect to receive payment in
any form (annuity or lump sum) designated by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, of the Company, provided that such election is made in the form
and manner determined by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources not less than twelve (12) months before the date the payment would have first
commenced under the Participant’s prior election. In addition, the first payment under the new election must commence no earlier than sixty (60) months
from the date when the payment would have first commenced under the Participant’s prior election. Such change in election shall not be given effect until
twelve (12) months from the date that the change in election is delivered to the Company.
(ii)    Timing of Payment. Regardless of the form of payment, a Participant may elect to delay payment of his benefit provided such
election is made in writing in the form and manner determined by the Senior
6
Vice President, Human Resources, not less than twelve (12) months before the date the payment would have first commenced under the Participant’s prior
election. In addition, the first payment under the new election must commence no earlier than sixty (60) months from when the payment would have first
commenced under the Participant’s prior election. No interest shall be paid between the date of Termination of Employment or attainment of age fifty-five
(55), as applicable, and the payment date. Such change in election shall not be given effect until twelve (12) months from the date that the change in election
is delivered to the Company.
(f)    Notwithstanding the above, for periods prior to January 1, 2009 (or such later date as may be provided by the Internal Revenue Service in
guidance of general applicability), the Senior Vice President, Human Resources may provide alternative rules for elections with respect to the commencement
of payment and form of payment, provided that such rules conform to Code section 409A and Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder.
(g)    If a Participant participates in more than one supplemental pension plan sponsored by the Corporation, the Participant must make a single
election that shall apply to his or her benefits under all such plans with respect to the form of annuity (under Section 1(a) of this Article IV) and with respect
to prospective changes of payment (under Section 1(e) of this Article IV).
2.Deductibility of Payments. Subject to the provisions of Section Code section 409A, in the event that the Company reasonably anticipates that the
payment of benefits in accordance with the Participant’s election under Section 1 would prevent the Company from claiming an income tax deduction with
respect to any portion of the benefits paid under Code section 162(m), the Committee shall have the right to delay the timing of distributions from the
Participant’s Account as necessary to maximize the Company’s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a delayed distribution schedule, the
Committee shall undertake to have distributions made at such times and in such amounts as the Company reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably
anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year, the deduction will not be barred by Code section 162(m) or upon a Termination of Employment in
accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-2(b)(7)(i), consistent with the objective of maximum deductibility for the Company. The Committee
shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’s Account Balance or to pay aggregate benefits less than the Participant’s Account Balance in the event that all
or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the Company. All scheduled payments under this Plan and any other plan required to be aggregated with this
Plan must be delayed in order for such payment to be delayed pursuant to this Section 2.

APPENDIX A TO ANNEX III
GRANDFATHERED BENEFITS UNDER THE LMC TRANSFER COMPONENT
This Appendix A shall govern the portion of a Participant’s benefit that accrued and vested under the Plan on or before December 31, 2004. This Appendix A
shall not apply to the portion of a Participant’s benefit that accrued and vested under the Plan on or after January 1, 2005.
ARTICLE I.
TRANSFER BENEFITS
1. Eligibility. Benefits pursuant to this Article I are available to employees of the Company who:
(a)    are Members of the Qualified Pension Plan, and
(b)    are transferred to a Participating Company that does not have a Qualified Pension Plan, and
(c)    are identified by such Participating Company as a key employee at the time of such transfer, and
(d)    are designated in writing by the Committee as a Participant in this Plan.
A “Participating Company” is a business unit designated in writing by the Committee as a unit participating in this Plan. A list of Participating
Companies is set forth in Schedule 1.
2.Amount of Benefit. The benefit that each Participant shall be entitled to receive is the difference between the Participant’s actual benefit under the
Qualified Pension Plan and the benefits that would have been payable under that Plan, subject to the offset below, if:
(a)    the Qualified Pension Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below;
(b)    the Participant’s period of employment service as a Participant at a Participating Company at which no Credited Service is earned was deemed
to be years of Credited Service under the Qualified Pension Plan; and
(c)    the Participant’s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17).
If a Participant’s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable earnings under the
Qualified Pension Plan, the Participant’s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match” basis. The Participant’s annual compensation
earned under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable earnings. The average of the three (3) highest years of MICP
compensation during the last 10 years shall be added to the average of the three (3) highest years of other pensionable earnings during the last 10 years to
arrive at total final average pensionable earnings for the applicable period under the Qualified Pension Plan.
The above benefit (the “Transfer Benefit”) shall be offset by the benefits payable on behalf of the Participant under the Lockheed Martin Corporation
Capital Accumulation Plan (the “Lockheed Martin CAP”) and under the Lockheed Martin Account Balance Retirement Plan (“ABRP”). In calculating the
offset, the Participant’s total account balance from the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be converted into an annuity using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality
Table for males and the PBGC interest rate. The benefits payable under the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be calculated as of the Participant’s termination of
employment, using the Actuarial Equivalent. If the Participant received any prior distributions from the Lockheed Martin CAP, the Transfer Benefit shall be
reduced by the annuity value of the prior distribution, using the Lockheed Martin CAP distribution amount, the PBGC interest rate plus 1% and Participant’s
age on the date of distribution. The Transfer Benefit is then reduced for the amount of the normal retirement benefit from the ABRP.
Combined benefits under this Article I, the Lockheed Martin CAP and the ABRP are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit under
the Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the Qualified Pension Plan
on a “mix and match”
1
basis, without regard to the limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), and with the special adjustments described above. To prevent
duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced Transfer Benefit described above shall be calculated without
reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified Pension Plan, and then reduced by the
benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin CAP and ABRP. The remainder of the benefit shall be paid from this Plan. Participants have no right to duplicate
benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee deems
necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article I shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who is receiving or entitled to receive
benefits with respect to the Participant under the Qualified Pension Plan.
If the benefits payable under the Qualified Pension Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’s retirement as a result of a general
increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan unless the Committee expressly so
provides in writing.
ARTICLE II.
INCENTIVE BENEFITS
1. Eligibility. Benefits pursuant to this Article II are available to the employees described below. However, an employee who terminated employment
with Lockheed Corporation prior to January 1, 1984, when eligible for a deferred retirement benefit under Section 5.03 of the Lockheed Retirement Plan for
Certain Salaried Employees is not eligible to receive a benefit under this Article II.
An employee or former employee of Lockheed Martin Corporation and its subsidiaries who:
(a) is employed by a Lockheed Martin business unit that is not covered by a Qualified Pension Plan, and
(b) is identified by such business unit as a key employee, and
(c) at the time of eligibility for benefits is, or for any year during his or her last ten (10) years of service with Lockheed Martin Corporation
was, a participant in the Lockheed Martin Corporation Management Incentive Compensation Plan (including the Deferred Management Incentive
Compensation Plan of Lockheed Martin Corporation), or any incentive compensation plan of any subsidiary or affiliated corporation of Lockheed Martin
Corporation which the Committee determines is a corresponding incentive plan; and
(d) who has been specifically designated in writing by the Committee as a Participant; and
(e) who is not eligible for a benefit under Article I of this Plan.
2. Amount of Benefit.
A.    Normal or Disability Retirement. The benefit payable under this Article II to a Participant at normal retirement age is the difference between the
Participant’s actual benefit under the Lockheed Martin Retirement Plan for Certain Salaried Employees (or such other Qualified Pension Plan as designated
by the Committee (the “Designated Qualified Plan”)) and the benefits that would have been payable under that Plan, subject to the offset below, if:
(a) the Designated Qualified Plan had determined pensionable earnings on a “mix and match” basis, as defined below;
(b) the Participant’s period of employment service as a Participant with the Company at which no Credited Service is earned because the
Participant was not in a covered group or because of a limitation on Credited Service under the Qualified Pension Plan was deemed to be years of Credited
Service under the Designated Qualified Plan; and
(c) the Participant’s benefit under the Designated Qualified Plan had not been limited by Code section 415 and/or Code section 401(a)(17).
2
If a Participant’s compensation under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (“MICP”) is included in pensionable earnings under the Qualified
Pension Plan, the Participant’s total pensionable earnings shall be determined on a “mix and match” basis. The Participant’s annual compensation earned
under the MICP shall be calculated separately from other annual pensionable earnings. The average of the highest years of MICP compensation shall be
added to the average of the highest years of other pensionable earnings to arrive at total final average pensionable earnings for the applicable period under the
Qualified Pension Plan.
The above benefit (the “Incentive Benefit”) shall be offset by the benefits payable on behalf of the Participant under the Lockheed Martin Corporation
Capital Accumulation Plan (the “Lockheed Martin CAP”) and under the Lockheed Martin Account Balance Retirement Plan (“ABRP”). In calculating the
offset, the Participant’s total account balance from the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be converted into an annuity using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality
Table and the PBGC interest rate. The benefits payable under the Lockheed Martin CAP shall be calculated as of the Participant’s termination of employment,
using the Actuarial Equivalent. If the Participant received any prior distributions from the Lockheed Martin CAP, the Incentive Benefit shall be reduced by
the annuity value of the prior distribution, using the Lockheed Martin CAP distribution amount, PBGC immediate interest rate for lump sums rate plus 1%
and Participant’s age on the date of distribution. The Incentive Benefit is then reduced for the amount of the Participant’s normal retirement benefit from the
ABRP.
B.    Early Retirement. The benefit payable under this Article II to a Participant who satisfies the Designated Qualified Plan rules for early retirement
eligibility as set forth in Article IV of the Qualified Pension Plan or for a deferred monthly retirement benefit in accordance with the rules set forth in Article
VIII of the Qualified Pension Plan, whether or not such Participant is a member of the Qualified Pension Plan, shall be calculated in accordance with the
provisions of Article V of the Qualified Pension Plan, for early retirement, or Article VIII of the Qualified Pension Plan, for deferred retirement, as applied to
the benefit amount calculated in accordance with Paragraph A, above.
C. Pre-Retirement Surviving Spouse Benefit. If a Pre-retirement Surviving Spouse Benefit would have applied had the Participant been eligible to
participate in the Designated Qualified Plan, such survivor benefit shall automatically apply to any benefit which he or she may be eligible under this Plan.
The survivor benefit shall be adjusted and paid in the same manner as such pension payable under the Designated Qualified Plan would be adjusted and paid
on account of such survivor benefit.
Combined benefits under this Article II, the Lockheed Martin CAP and the ABRP are intended to supplement the Participant’s actual benefit under the
Qualified Pension Plan as necessary to provide the Participant with the full benefit the Participant would have received under the Qualified Pension Plan on a
“mix and match” basis, without regard to the limitations of Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), and with the special adjustments described above.
To prevent duplication of benefits, the full benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan and the enhanced Incentive Benefit described above shall be calculated
without reduction for Code section 415 and Code section 401(a)(17), then reduced by the benefit payable from the Qualified Pension Plan, and then reduced
by the benefit payable from the Lockheed Martin CAP and ABRP. The remainder of the benefit shall be paid from this Plan. Participants have no right to
duplicate benefits with respect to the same period of service, and the Committee may make such adjustments to the benefits under this Plan as the Committee
deems necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
The benefit payable under this Article II shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or any other person who would be entitled to receive benefits
with respect to the Participant under the Designated Qualified Plan.
If the benefits that would be payable under the Designated Qualified Plan to any Participant are increased following the Participant’s retirement as a
result of a general increase in the benefits payable to retired employees under that Plan, no such increase will be made under this Plan unless the Committee
expressly so provides in writing.
ARTICLE III.
PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
3
1. Form of Payment. Benefits shall be paid in the same form at the same times and for the same period as benefits are paid with respect to the Participant
under the applicable Qualified Pension Plan, except as provided in the following paragraphs. Actuarial adjustments shall be based on the factors set forth in
the Qualified Pension Plan, except as provided in the following paragraphs. If the benefits payable under this Plan correspond to Qualified Pension Plan
benefits with multiple commencement dates, each portion of the benefits payable under this Plan shall be paid at the same time as the corresponding portion
of the benefits is paid from the Qualified Pension Plan. If a Participant is not entitled to benefits under the Qualified Pension Plan, benefits shall be paid as if
the Participant had been a member of the Lockheed Martin Retirement Plan for Certain Salaried Employees (or such other Qualified Retirement Plan as
designated by the Committee) and had chosen from among the forms of payment available under such Plan. If an Employee’s benefits under the Qualified
Pension Plan are suspended for any month in accordance with the re-employment provisions thereof, the Participant’s benefit for that month shall likewise be
suspended under Articles I and II of this Plan.
Lump Sum Option. A Participant may irrevocably elect to receive a full or partial single lump sum payment in an amount which is the actuarial
equivalent of the benefit described above. The actuarial equivalent will be computed using the Actuarial Equivalent, and with no interest for the period
between the date of termination of employment and the payment date. This election must be made within the time period for electing the form of benefit
under the corresponding Qualified Pension Plan, by filing a written election in the form and manner prescribed by the Company. Payment will be made six (6)
months following the date payments would otherwise begin pursuant to the above paragraph. If a Participant is not entitled to benefits under the Qualified
Pension Plan, the Participant may make the election at any time after the Participant would have qualified for early retirement under the Qualified Pension
Plan had the Participant been a member of such Plan. Payment will be made six (6) months following the date of such Participant’s election.
Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit. In the event the Participant dies prior to the date his or her retirement has commenced under this Plan and the
corresponding Qualified Pension Plan, the pre-retirement survivor benefit payable to the surviving spouse (if any) under this Plan (the “Pre-Retirement
Survivor Benefit” and the “Surviving Spouse”) will be payable, at the election of the Surviving Spouse, in any of the following forms:
(a) in the form of a monthly annuity payable to the Surviving Spouse for his lifetime, with no further payments to anyone after his
death (which will be referred to as the “Regular Form”);
(b) in the form of a lump sum payment which is the actuarial equivalent of the Regular Form (the “100% Lump Sum”), but with
actuarial equivalence determined as of the Election Date using the Actuarial Equivalent, and with no interest for the period between the Election Date (or, if
later, the date the Participant would have attained age 55 had he survived) and the payment date; or
(c) in the form of a combined lump sum and life annuity benefit of (x) and (y), where (x) equals a lump sum amount selected by the
Surviving Spouse which is less than the 100% Lump Sum and (y) is a monthly single life annuity for the life of Surviving Spouse (with no further payments
to anyone after his death) in an amount that can be provided with the difference between (x) and the 100% Lump Sum.
Any election to receive the benefit in the form of a lump sum as set forth in (b) above or a combined lump sum and annuity as set forth in (c) above
must be made by the Surviving Spouse no later than 90 days after the date of the Participant’s death or, if later, the date the Participant would have attained
age 55 had he survived (with the date such election is made by the Surviving Spouse referred to as the “Election Date”). In the event the Surviving Spouse
makes an election for a lump sum or partial lump sum payment within this period, payment will not be made to the Surviving Spouse until six months after
the Election Date (or, if later, six months after the date the benefit would otherwise be payable under this Plan).
Cash-out of Small Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, if the Value of the sum of the benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary under this Plan
does not exceed the amount that may be distributed without consent under Section 411(a)(11) of the Code, all such benefits will be paid in a single lump sum
payment in full discharge of all liabilities with respect to such benefits. For purposes of this Section, Value shall be determined as of the Participant’s
termination of employment, and shall mean the present value of a Participant’s or Beneficiary’s
4
benefits based upon the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate in Code section 417(e)(3)(ii) for the calendar month preceding the Plan Year in
which the termination of employment occurs.
2. Deductibility of Payments. In the event that the payment of benefits under Section 1 would prevent the Company from claiming an income tax
deduction with respect to any portion of the benefits paid, the Committee shall have the right to modify the form and timing of distributions as necessary to
maximize the Company’s tax deductions. In the exercise of its discretion to adopt a modified distribution schedule, the Committee shall undertake to have
distributions made at such times and in such amounts as most closely approximate the payment method described in Section 1, consistent with the objective
of maximum deductibility for the Company. The Committee shall have no authority to reduce a Participant’s accrued benefit under this Plan or to pay
aggregate benefits less than the Participant’s accrued benefit in the event that all or a portion thereof would not be deductible by the Company.
