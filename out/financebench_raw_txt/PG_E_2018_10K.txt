PART IITEM 1. BUSINESS
PG&E Corporation, incorporated in Cal
ifornia in 1995, is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a publicutility operating in nor
thern and central California. The Utility was incorporated in California in 1905. PG&E Corporation became the holding company of theUtility and its subsidiari
es in 1997. The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers. PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s operating revenues, income, and total assets can be found below in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.The principal executiv
e offices of PG&E Corporation and the Utility are located at 77 Beale Street, P.O. Box 770000, San Francisco, California 94177. PG&ECorporation’s telephone numbe
r is (415) 973-1000 and the Utility’s telephone number is (415) 973-7000.At 
December 31, 2018 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility had app roximately 24,000 regular employees, approx imately 13 of which were employees of PG&ECorporation. Of the Utility’s r
egular employees, approximately 14,500 are covered by collec tive bargaining agreements with the local chapters of three laborunions: the Internationa
l Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; the Engineers and Scientists of California; and the Service Employees International Union. Thecollective bargain
ing agreements currently in effect will expire on December 31, 2021.This is a combined Annual Report on Form 10-K fo

erienced major wildfires. For more information about the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, seeItem 3. Legal Proceedings, I
tem 7. MD&A, and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.This 
2018 Form 10-K contains forward-looking st atements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of the significant risksthat could affect th
e outcome of these forward-looking statements and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows, see I
tem 1A. Risk Factors and the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7. MD&A.Chapter 11 Proceedings
On January 29, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed for Chapter 11 protection. For more information about the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings see Item 7.MD&A and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Fin
ancial Statements in Item 8.PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e facing extraordinary challenges relating to the wildfires that occurred in Northern California in 2017 and 2018. Managementhas concluded that these c
ircumstances raise substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as going concerns, and theirindependent registered pub
lic accountants have included an explanatory paragraph in their auditors’ report which states certain conditions exist which raisesubstantial doubt about PG&E Corporation
’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as going concerns in relation to the foregoing. For more information about thesematters, see Item 7. MD&A and Not
e 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.8

Regulatory Environment The Utility's business is subject 
to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. At the state level, the Utility is regulatedprimarily by the CPUC. At the federa
l level, the Utility is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC and the NRC. The Utility is also subject to the requirements ofother federal, stat
e and local regulatory agencies, including with respect to safety, the environment, and health. This section and the “Ratemaking Mechanisms”section below summarize so
me of the more significant laws, regulations, and regulatory proceedings affecting the Utility.PG&E Corporation is a “public util
ity holding company” as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and is subject to regulatory oversightby the FERC. PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries a
re exempt from all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 other than theobligation to provide acc
ess to their books and records to the FERC and the CPUC for ratemaking purposes.The California Public Utilities Commiss
ionThe CPUC is a regulatory agency that r
egulates privately owned public utilities in California. The CPUC has jurisdiction over the rates and terms and conditions ofservice for the Utili
ty's electric and natural gas distribution operations, electric generation, and natural gas transmission and storage services. The CPUC also hasexercised jurisdict
ion over the Utility's issuances of securities, dispositions of utility assets and facilities, energy purchases on behalf of the Utility's electric andnatural gas retail 
customers, rates of return, rates of depreciation, oversight of nuclear decommissioning, and aspects of the siting of facilities used in providingelectric and natur
al gas utility service.The CPUC enforces state laws and regula
tions that set forth safety requirements pertaining to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of utilitygas and electric fa
cilities.  The CPUC can impose penalties of up to $50,000 per day, per violation, for violations that occurred after January 1, 2012. (The statutorymaximum penalty for vio
lations that occurred before January 1, 2012 is $20,000 per violation.) The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount ofpenalties based on the tot
ality of the circumstances, including such factors as the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the numberof persons affected; and 
the good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The CPUC also is required toconsider the appropriat
eness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issu
e citations and impose penalties for violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports. Underthe current gas and ele
ctric citation programs adopted by the CPUC in September 2016, the SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation, but ifit assesses a penalty for 
a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $50,000, with an administrative limit of $8 million per citationissued. Effective January 1, 2019, 
the maximum statutory penalty increased to $100,000. The SED may, at its discretion, impose penalties on a daily basis, or onless than a daily basis, for v
iolations that continued for more than one day. The SED has the discretion to either address each violation in a distinct citation or toinclude multiple viol
ations in a single citation regardless of whether the violations occurred in the same incident or are of a similar nature. Penalty payments forcitations issued pursuant to 
the gas and electric safety citation programs are the responsibility of shareholders of an issuer and must not be recovered in rates orotherwise directly or in
directly charged to customers.The California State Legis
lature also directs the CPUC to implement state laws and policies, such as the laws relating to wildfires and wildfire cost recovery,increasing renewable en
ergy resources, the development and widespread deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, the reduction of GHGemissions, the establishm
ent of energy storage procurement targets, and the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The CPUC isresponsible for approving funding 
and administration of state-mandated public purpose programs such as energy efficiency and other customer programs. TheCPUC also conducts audits and reviews of the Uti
lity’s accounting, performance, and compliance with regulatory guidelines.The CPUC has imposed various conditions that gove
rn the relationship between the Utility and PG&E Corporation and other affiliates, including financialconditions that require PG&E Corpor
ation’s Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary andprudent to meet the Util
ity's obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. (For more information, see “Liquidity and FinancialResources” in Item 7. MD&A and Ite
m 1A. Risk Factors.)9

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the California Independent System OperatorThe FERC has jurisdiction over the Util
ity's electric transmission revenue requirements and rates, the licensing of substantially all of the Utility's hydroelectricgeneration facili
ties, and the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas. The FERC regulates the interconnections of the Utility’s transmission systems withother electric system and ge
neration facilities, the tariffs and conditions of service of regional transmission organizations and the terms and rates of wholesaleelectricity sal
es. The FERC also is charged with adopting and enforcing mandatory standards governing the reliability of the nation’s electric transmission grid,including standards to prote
ct the nation’s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. The FERC has authority toimpose fines of up to $1 mill
ion per day for violations of certain federal statutes and regulations.The CAISO is the FERC-approved regional transmiss
ion organization for the Utility’s service territory. The CAISO controls the operation of the electrictransmission system in Cali
fornia and provides open access transmission service on a non-discriminatory basis. The CAISO also is responsible for planningtransmission system addit
ions, ensuring the maintenance of adequate reserves of generating capacity, and ensuring that the reliability of the transmission system ismaintained.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
The NRC oversees the licensing, constru
ction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, including the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at DiabloCanyon and the Utility’s reti
red nuclear generating unit at Humboldt Bay. (See “Electricity Resources” below.) NRC regulations require extensive monitoring andreview of the safety, rad
iological, seismic, environmental, and security aspects of these facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority toimpose fines or to force 
a shutdown of a nuclear plant, or both. NRC safety and security requirements have, in the past, necessitated substantial capitalexpenditures at Diablo Canyon, and subst
antial capital expenditures could be required in the future. (For more information about Diablo Canyon, see “RegulatoryMatters - Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Pl
ant” in Item 7. MD&A and Item 3. Legal Proceedings below.)Third-party monitor
On April 12, 2017, the Utility retain
ed a third-party monitor at the Utility’s expense as part of its compliance with the sentencing terms of the Utility’s January 27,2017 federal crimina
l conviction, which sentenced the Utility to, among other things, a five-year corporate probation period and oversight by a third-party monitorfor a period of five yea
rs, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years.  The goal of the third-party monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takesreasonable and appropriate
 steps to maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations and maintains effective ethics, compliance, and safety related incentiveprograms on a Utility-wide bas
is. (For more information see Item 1A. Risk Factors and "U.S. District Court Matters and Probation" in Item 3. Legal Proceedingsand in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolida
ted Financial Statements in Item 8.)Other Regulators
The CEC is the state's primary en
ergy policy and planning agency. The CEC is responsible for licensing all thermal power plants over 50 MW within California.The CEC also is responsible for fore
casts of future energy needs used by the CPUC in determining the adequacy of the utilities' electricity procurement plans andfor adopting building and appli
ance energy efficiency requirements.The CARB is the state agency responsible 
for setting and monitoring GHG and other emission limits. The CARB is also responsible for adopting and enforcingregulations to implem
ent state law requirements to gradually reduce GHG emissions in California. (See “Environmental Regulation - Air Quality and ClimateChange” below.)
In addition, the Utility obt
ains permits, authorizations, and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of the Utility's generation facilities,electricity transmission lines,
 natural gas transportation pipelines, and gas compressor station facilities. The Utility also periodically obtains permits,authorizations, and lic
enses in connection with distribution of electricity and natural gas that grant the Utility rights to occupy and/or use public property for theoperation of the Utility's bus
iness and to conduct certain related operations. The Utility has franchise agreements with approximately 300 cities and counties thatpermit the Utility to 
install, operate, and maintain the Utility's electric and natural gas facilities in the public streets and highways. In exchange for the right to usepublic streets and highways, the Ut
ility pays annual fees to the cities and counties. In most cases, the Utility’s franchise agreements are for an indeterminate term,with no expiration date. (For mo
re information see Item 1A. Risk Factors.)10

Ratemaking MechanismsThe Utility’s rates for 
electric and natural gas utility services are set at levels that are intended to allow the Utility to recover its costs of providing service and areturn on invested capit
al (“cost-of-service ratemaking”). Before setting rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct proceedings to determine the annual amount thatthe Utility will be aut
horized to collect from its customers (“revenue requirements”). The Utility’s revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set toenable the Utility to r
ecover its reasonable operating expenses (e.g., maintenance, administration and general expenses) and capital costs (e.g., depreciation, tax,and financing expenses). In add
ition, the CPUC authorizes the Utility to collect revenues to recover costs that the Utility is allowed to “pass-through” to customers(referred to as “Uti
lity Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Item 7. MD&A), including its costs to procure electricity, natural gas and nuclear fuel,to administer public purpos
e and customer programs, and to decommission its nuclear facilities.The Utility’s rate of r
eturn on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceedings. Similarly, the authorized rate of return on all other Utilityassets is set in the CPUC’s cost of capi
tal proceeding. Other than its electric transmission and certain gas transmission and storage revenues, the Utility’s baserevenues are “decoupled
” from its sales volume. Regulatory balancing accounts, or revenue adjustment mechanisms, are designed to allow the Utility to fullycollect its authori
zed base revenue requirements. As a result, the Utility’s base revenues are not impacted by fluctuations in sales resulting from, for example,weather or economic condi
tions. The Utility’s earnings primarily depend on its ability to manage its base operating and capital costs (referred to as “UtilityRevenues and Costs that Impacted E
arnings” in Item 7. MD&A) within its authorized base revenue requirements.Due to the seasonal nature of 
the Utility’s business and rate design, customer electric bills are generally higher during summer months (May - October) because ofhigher demand, driven by air 
conditioning loads.  Customer bills related to gas service generally increase during the winter months (November - March) to accountfor the gas peak due to heat
ing.From time to time, the CPUC may use in
centive ratemaking mechanisms that provide the Utility an opportunity to earn some additional revenues. For example, theUtility has earned incen
tives for the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs. 
See “Regulatory Matters” 
in Item 7. MD&A for more information on specific CPUC proceedings.Base Revenues
General
Rate
Cases
The GRC is the primary proceeding in whi
ch the CPUC determines the amount of base revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect fromcustomers to recover th
e Utility’s anticipated costs, including return on rate base, related to its electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and Utility-ownedelectric genera
tion operations. The CPUC generally conducts a GRC every three or four years. The CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the firstyear (or “test year
”) of the GRC period and typically authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRCperiod (known as
 “attrition years”). Attrition year rate adjustments are generally provided for cost increases related to increases in invested capital and inflation.Parties in the Utility's GRC include 
the PAO and TURN, who generally represent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as a myriad of otherintervenors who represent oth
er business, community, customer, environmental, and union interests. (For more information about the Utility’s GRC, see“Regulatory Matters 2017 Gener
al Rate Case” and “Regulatory Matters 2020 General Rate Case” in Item 7. MD&A.)Natural
Gas
Transmission
and
Storage
Rate
Cases
The CPUC determines the Utility’s au
thorized revenue requirements and rates for its natural gas transmission and storage services in the GT&S rate case.  TheCPUC generally conducts a GT&S rate case 
every three or four years.  Similar to the GRC, the CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the first year(or “test year”) of the G
T&S rate case period and typically determines annual increases in revenue requirements for attrition years of the GT&S rate case period. Parties in the Utility's GT&S ra
te case include the PAO and TURN, who generally represent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as otherintervenors who represent oth
er business, community, customer, environmental, and union interests. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - 2015 GasTransmission and Storage Rate Case

capital proceeding to authorize the Utility's capital structure and rates of return for its electric generation, electric andnatural gas distribution, 
and natural gas transmission and storage rate base. The CPUC has authorized the Utility’s capital structure through 2019, consisting of52% common equity, 47% long-te
rm debt, and 1% preferred stock. The CPUC also set the authorized ROE through 2017 at 10.40% and 10.25% beginning onJanuary 1, 2018 and reset the cost o
f debt to 4.89%. The CPUC previously adopted an adjustment mechanism to allow the Utility’s capital structure and ROE to beadjusted if the utili
ty bond index changes by certain thresholds on an annual basis. The Utility expects to submit its next cost of capital application to the CPUC onor about April 22, 2019.

Owner
Rate
Cases
The FERC determines the amount of au
thorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect inrates in the TO rate cas
e. The Utility has historically filed a TO rate case every year. The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on therequested revenue requi
rement, subject to refund, before the FERC has issued a final decision. In 2018, the Utility filed a proposed formula rate at FERC, whichwould be updated annually accord
ing to the formula. These FERC-approved rates are included by the CPUC in the Utility's retail electric rates and by the CAISOin its Transmission Access Charges 
to wholesale customers. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters -Transmission Owner Rate Cases” in Item 7.MD&A.) The Utility also recovers 
a portion of its revenue requirements for its wholesale electric transmission costs through charges collected under specificcontracts with wholesale t
ransmission customers that the Utility entered into before the CAISO began its operations. These wholesale customers are chargedindividualized rates b
ased on the terms of their contracts.Memorandum
Account
Costs
Periodically, costs aris
e which could not be anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests resulting from catastrophic events, changes in regulation, orextraordinary changes in op
erating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in a memorandum account and the CPUC may authorizerecovery of costs track
ed in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incremental and prudently incurred. These accounts, which include the CEMA,WEMA, and FHPMA, among others, allow the Utility to t
rack the costs associated with work related to disaster and wildfire response, and other wildfireprevention-related 
costs. While the Utility believes such costs are recoverable, rate recovery requires CPUC authorization in separate proceedings or through aGRC. (For more information, see “Regul
atory Matters - Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account”, “Regulatory Matters - Catastrophic Expense MemorandumAccount”, and “Regulatory Matt
ers - Fire Hazard Prevention Memorandum Account” in Item 7. MD&A.)Revenues to Recover Energy Procurement and Other Pass-Through Costs
Electricity
Procurement
Costs
California investor-ow
ned electric utilities are responsible for procuring electrical capacity required to meet bundled customer demand, plus applicable reservemargins, that are not sati
sfied from their own generation facilities and existing electric contracts. The utilities are responsible for scheduling and bidding electricgeneration resources, incl
uding certain electricity procured from third parties into the wholesale market, to meet customer demand according to which resourcesare the least expensiv
e (i.e., using the principles of “least-cost dispatch”). In addition, the utilities are required to obtain CPUC approval of their BCPPs based onlong-term demand fore
casts. In October 2015, the CPUC approved the Utility’s most recent BCPP. It was revised since its initial approval and will remain in effectas revised until superseded by 
a subsequent CPUC-approved plan. On February 8, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s filing that suspended certain elements ofits current BCPP as a result of its 
financial condition, effective as of January 16, 2019.  Additionally, on January 25, 2019, the Utility filed with the CPUC anupdate to its BCPP to further refin
e how it manages certain elements of its procurement activity and provide detail of its sales framework.  The updated BCPPwould be effective upon CPUC approval.
California law allows ele
ctric utilities to recover the costs incurred in compliance with their CPUC-approved BCPPs without further after-the-fact reasonablenessreview by the CPUC. The CPUC may disallow costs associated with 
electricity purchases if the costs were not incurred in compliance with the CPUC-approvedplan or if the CPUC determines tha
t the utility failed to follow the principles of least-cost dispatch. Additionally, the CPUC may disallow the cost of replacementpower procured due to unplanned outag
es at Utility-owned generation facilities.12

The Utility recovers its electric procurement costs annually primarily through the energy resource recovery account. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8.) Each year, the CPUC reviews the Utility’s forecasted procurement costs related to power purchase agreements, derivativeinstruments, GHG emissions costs, and gene
ration fuel expense, and approves a forecasted revenue requirement. The CPUC may adjust the Utility’s retail electricrates more frequently if the f
orecasted aggregate over-collections or under-collections in the energy resource recovery account exceed 5% of its prior year electricprocurement and Utility
-owned generation revenues. The CPUC performs an annual compliance review of the transactions recorded in the energy resourcerecovery account.
The CPUC has approved various power purchase agre
ements that the Utility has entered into with third parties in accordance with the Utility’s CPUC-approvedprocurement plan, to meet ma
ndatory renewable energy targets, and to comply with resource adequacy requirements. (For more information, see “Electric UtilityOperations - Electric
ity Resources” below as well as Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)Natural
Gas
Procurement,
Storage,
and
Transportation
Costs
The Utility recovers the
 cost of gas used in generation facilities as a cost of electricity that is recovered annually through retail electric rates.The Utility sets the 
natural gas procurement rate for small commercial and residential customers (referred to as “core” customers) monthly, based on the forecastedcosts of natural gas, core p
ipeline capacity and storage costs. The Utility recovers the cost of gas purchased on behalf of core customers as well as the cost ofderivative instruments for it
s core gas portfolio, through its retail gas rates, subject to limits as set forth in its core procurement incentive mechanism describedbelow. The Utility reflec
ts the difference between actual natural gas purchase costs and forecasted natural gas purchase costs in several natural gas balancingaccounts, with under-colle
ctions and over-collections taken into account in subsequent monthly rate changes.The core procurement incenti
ve mechanism protects the Utility against after-the-fact reasonableness reviews of its gas procurement costs for its core gas portfolio.Under the core procureme
nt incentive mechanism, the Utility’s natural gas purchase costs for a fixed 12-month period are compared to an aggregate market-basedbenchmark based on a weighted av
erage of published monthly and daily natural gas price indices at the points where the Utility typically purchases natural gas.Costs that fall within a tol
erance band, which is 99% to 102% of the commodity benchmark, are considered reasonable and are fully recovered in customers’ rates.One-half of the costs above 102% o
f the benchmark are recoverable in customers’ rates, and the Utility's customers receive in their rates 80% of any savingsresulting from the Util
ity’s cost of natural gas that is less than 99% of the benchmark. The Utility retains the remaining amount of these savings as incentiverevenues, subject to a cap 
equal to 1.5% of total natural gas commodity costs. While this mechanism remains in place, changes in the price of natural gas,consistent with the marke
t-based benchmark, are not expected to materially impact net income. 
The Utility incurs transpor
tation costs under various agreements with interstate and Canadian third-party transportation service providers. These providers transportnatural gas from the poin
ts at which the Utility takes delivery of natural gas (typically in Canada, the U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern United States)to the points at which the Util
ity's natural gas transportation system begins.  These agreements are governed by FERC-approved tariffs that detail rates, rules, andterms of service for 
the provision of natural gas transportation services to the Utility on interstate and Canadian pipelines. The FERC approves the United Statestariffs that shippers, 
including the Utility, pay for pipeline service, and the applicable Canadian tariffs are approved by the National Energy Board, a Canadianregulatory agency. The tr
ansportation costs the Utility incurs under these agreements are recovered through CPUC-approved rates as core natural gas procurementcosts or as a cost of elec
tricity.13

Costs
Associated
with
Public
Purpose
and
Customer
ProgramsThe CPUC authorizes the Utility to re
cover the costs of various public purpose and other customer programs through the collection of rates from most Utilitycustomers.  These programs r
elate to energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, energy research and development, and other matters. Additionally, the CPUC has authorized the Ut
ility to provide discounted rates for specified types of customers, such as for low-income customers under theCalifornia Alternate Ra
tes for Energy (“CARE”) program, which is paid for by the Utility’s other customers.Nuclear
Decommissioning
Costs
The Utility's nuclear power f
acilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and the retired facility at Humboldt Bay. Nuclear decommissioning requires the saferemoval of nuclear facilities from 
service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of theproperty for unrestric
ted use. Nuclear decommissioning costs are generally collected in advance through rates and are held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to beused for the eventual deco
mmissioning of each nuclear unit. The Utility files an application with the CPUC every three years requesting approval of the Utility’supdated estimated deco
mmissioning costs and any rate change necessary to fully fund the nuclear decommissioning trusts to the levels needed to decommission theUtility’s nuclear plants.
On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirem
ent of Diablo Canyon’s two nuclear power reactor units by 2024 and 2025. The CPUC:•
deferred consideration of replacement resources to the CPUC’s Integrated Resource Planning proceeding;•
authorized rate recovery for up to $211.3 million (compared with the $352.1 million requested by the Utility) for an employee retention program;•
authorized rate recovery for an employee retraining program of $11.3 million requested by the Utility;•
rejected rate recovery of the proposed $85 million for the community impacts mitigation program on the grounds that rate recovery for such a programrequires legislativ
e authorization;•
authorized rate recovery of $18.6 million of the total Diablo Canyon license renewal cost of $53 million and rate recovery of canceled project costs equalto 100% of direct costs incu
rred prior to June 30, 2016, and 25% of direct costs incurred after June 30, 2016, based on a provision of the settlementagreement among the Uti
lity, the Joint Parties, and certain other parties that the Utility filed with the CPUC in May 2017; and•
approved the amortization of the book value for Diablo Canyon consistent with the Diablo Canyon closure schedule.On March 7, 2018, the Utility submitt
ed a request to the NRC to withdraw its Diablo Canyon license renewal application. On April 16, 2018, the NRC granted theUtility’s request to withdr
aw its license renewal application.On November 29, 2018, in response to SB 1090, the CPUC issued its decision add
ressing the key remaining goals of the Diablo Canyon joint proposal agreement,including:
•
approving the community impact mitigation settlement of $85 million, originally proposed in the joint settlement agreement;•
deferring implementation to its Integrated Resource Planning to ensure that there is no increase in GHG emissions as a result of the Diablo Canyonretirement; and
•
approving full funding of the $352.1 million Diablo Canyon employee retention program, originally proposed in the joint settlement agreement.On February 8, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility's reques
t to implement SB 1090, effective as of January 1, 2019, which includes full funding for thecommunity impact mi
tigation program and employee retention program.For costs related to Asset Reti
rement Obligations see "Nuclear Decommissioning Obligation" in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements initem 8.

Electric Utility OperationsThe Utility generates electricity
 and provides electric transmission and distribution services throughout its service territory in northern and central California toresidential, comme
rcial, industrial, and agricultural customers. The Utility provides “bundled” services (i.e., electricity, transmission and distribution services) tocustomers in its servic
e territory. Customers also can obtain electricity from alternative providers such as municipalities or CCAs, as well as from self-generationresources, such as rooftop sola
r installations. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.)Electricity Resources
The Utility is required
 to maintain capacity adequate to meet its customers’ demand for electricity (“load”), including peak demand and planning and operatingreserves, deliverabl
e to the locations and at times as may be necessary to provide reliable electric service. The Utility is required to dispatch, or schedule all of theelectric resourc
es within its portfolio using least-cost dispatch . The following table shows the perc
entage of the Utility’s total deliveries of electricity to customers in 2018 represented by each major electric  resource, and furtherdiscussed below.

Renewable
Energy
ResourcesCalifornia law establish
ed an RPS that requires load-serving entities, such as the Utility, to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy they deliver to theircustomers. In October 2015, the Cal
ifornia Governor signed SB 350, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015 into law. SB 350 became effectiveJanuary 1, 2016, and increases the 
amount of renewable energy that must be delivered by most load-serving entities, including the Utility, to their customers from33% of their total annua
l retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020 compliance period, to 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2028- 2030compliance period, and in 
each three-year compliance period thereafter, unless changed by legislative action. SB 350 provides compliance flexibility and waivermechanisms, including inc
reased flexibility to apply excess renewable energy procurement in one compliance period to future compliance periods. In September2018, the California Governor signed SB 100 into 
law, increasing from 50% to 60% of California’s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030;and established state pol
icy that 100 percent of all retail electricity sales must come from RPS-eligible or carbon-free resources by 2045. The Utility may incuradditional costs to procur
e renewable energy to meet the new renewable energy targets, which the Utility expects will continue to be recoverable from customers as“pass-through” costs. The Utili
ty also may be subject to penalties for failure to meet the higher targets. The CPUC is required to open a new rulemakingproceeding to adopt regula
tions to implement the higher renewable targets.Renewable generation resour
ces, for purposes of the RPS requirements, include bioenergy such as biogas and biomass, certain hydroelectric facilities (30 MW orless), wind, solar, and geotherm
al energy. During 2018 , 38.9% of the Utility’s energy de liveries were from renewable energy sources, exceeding the annual RPStarget of 
28% . Approximately 36% of the renewable energy de livered to the Utility’s customers was purchased from non-QF third parties. Additional renewableresources were provided by QFs ( 
0.5% ), the Utility’s small h ydroelectric facilities ( 1.5% ), and the Utility’s solar facilities ( 0.6% ). The total

Storage
As required by California law, th
e CPUC established a multi-year energy storage procurement framework, including energy storage procurement targets to beachieved by each load-se
rving entity under the CPUC jurisdiction, including the Utility. Under the adopted energy storage procurement framework, the Utility isrequired to procure 580 MW of qu
alifying storage capacity by the end of 2021, with all energy storage projects required to be operational by the end of 2024.The CPUC also adopted biennial interi
m storage targets for the Utility, beginning in 2014 and ending in 2020. Under the adopted framework, the Utility is requiredto submit biennial energ
y storage procurement plans to describe its strategy to meet its interim and total energy storage targets.As of November 2018, the Utility had me
t and exceeded its 2018 interim storage targets and had approximately 35 MW remaining to procure to meet the totalstorage targets estab
lished by the CPUC. This outcome may change in the future if projects under contract are terminated or if projects that have been approved bythe CPUC are rejected on rehea
ring.In 2018, the CPUC approved two proposals for the Utili
ty to own incremental battery storage facilities to be constructed by a third party. The Llagas EnergyStorage Project is a 20 MW proj
ect scheduled to come online in 2021. The Moss Landing Project is a 182.5 MW project scheduled to come online by the end of2020. In addition, the Utility cu
rrently owns or operates three battery storage facilities, each less than 10 MW.16

Canyon Nuclear Power Plant” in. Item 7. MD&A and Item 3. Legal Proceedings.)(2) 
The Utility’s hydroelectric system consists of 105 generating units at 66 powerhouses. All of the Utility’s powerhouses are licensed by the FERC (except for two small powerhouses notsubject to FERC licensing requirements), with license terms be
tween 30 and 50 years.(3) 
The Utility’s large photovoltaic facilities are Cantua solar station (20 MW), Five Points solar station (15 MW), Gates solar station (20 MW), Giffen solar station (10 MW), Guernsey solarstation
 (20 MW), Huron solar station (20 MW ), Stroud solar station (20 MW), West Gates solar station (10 MW), and Westside solar station (15 MW). All of these facilities are located inFresno County, except for Guernsey solar station, which is located in Kings County.
Generation
Resources

Third
Parties
The Utility has entered in
to various agreements to purchase power and electric capacity, including agreements for renewable energy resources, in accordance withits CPUC-approved procurement plan. (Se
e “Ratemaking Mechanisms” above.) For more information regarding the Utility’s power purchase agreements, see Note14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements in Item 8.Electricity Transmission 
At 
December 31, 2018 , the Utility owned approximat ely 18,000 circuit miles of in terconnected transmission lines operating at voltages ranging from 60 kV to 500kV. The Utility also operated 
84 electric transmission substations with a capacity of approximately 65,000 MVA. The Utility’s electric transmission system isinterconnected with el
ectric power systems in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, which includes many western states, Alberta and British Columbia,and parts of Mexico.
Decisions about expansions and main
tenance of the transmission system can be influenced by decisions of the Utility's regulators and the CAISO.Electricity Distribution
The Utility's electri
c distribution network consists of approximately 107,000 circuit miles of dis tribution lines (of which approximately 20% are underground and approximately 
80% are overhead), 50 transmission switching substations, and 769 distribution substations, with a capacity of approximately 32,000 MVA. The Utility’s distribution ne
twork interconnects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distribution substations, where equipment reduces the high-voltage transmission volt
ages to lower voltages, ranging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the Utility’s customers.17

These distribution substations serve as the central hubs for the Utility’s electric distribution network. Emanating from each substation are primary and secondarydistribution lines connec
ted to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users. In some cases, the Utilitysells electricity from its distrib
ution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity. The Utility operates electric distributioncontrol center fac
ilities in Concord, Rocklin, and Fresno, California; these control centers form a key part of the Utility’s efforts to create a smarter, more resilientgrid.

Natural Gas Utility Operations 
The Utility provides
 natural gas transportation services to “core” customers (i.e., small commercial and residential customers) and to “non-core” customers (i.e.,industrial, large commercial, an
d natural gas-fired electric generation facilities) that are connected to the Utility’s gas system in its service territory.  Corecustomers can purchase na
tural gas procurement service (i.e. ,
 natural gas supply) from either the Utility or non-utility third-party gas procurement serviceproviders (referred 
to as "core transport agents").  When core customers purchase gas supply from a core transport agent, the Utility continues to provide gasdelivery, metering and b
illing services to customers.  When the Utility provides both transportation and procurement services, the Utility refers to the combinedservice as “bundled” natu
ral gas service.  Currently, more than 97% of core customers, repr esenting approximately 80% of the annual core mark et demand, receivebundled natural gas servic
e from the Utility.18

The Utility generally does not provide procurement service to non-core customers, who must purchase their gas supplies from third-party suppliers, unless thecustomer is a natural g
as-fired generation facility that the Utility has a power purchase agreement with that includes its generation fuel expense. The Utility offersbackbone gas transmission, gas de
livery (local transmission and distribution), and gas storage services as separate and distinct services to its non-core customers. Access to the Utility's backbone g
as transmission system is available for all natural gas marketers and shippers, as well as non-core customers.  The Utility alsodelivers gas to off-syste
m customers (i.e., outside of the Utility’s service territory) and to third-party natural gas storage customers. 
Natural Gas Supplies
The Utility can receiv
e natural gas from all the major natural gas basins in western North America, including basins in western Canada, the Rocky Mountains, andthe southwestern United States. The Ut
ility can also receive natural gas from fields in California. The Utility purchases natural gas to serve its core customersdirectly from produce
rs and marketers in both Canada and the United States. The contract lengths and natural gas sources of the Utility’s portfolio of natural gaspurchase contracts have v
aried generally based on market conditions. During 2018 , the Utility purchased approx imately 287,000 MMcf of natural gas (net o f thesale of excess supply of gas). Substan
tially all of this natural gas was purchased under contracts with a term of one year or less. The Utility’s largest individualsupplier represented app
roximately 15% of the total natural g as volume the Utility purchased during 2018 . Natural Gas System Assets
The Utility owns and operates an in
tegrated natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution system that includes most of northern and central California. AtDecember 31, 2018 
, the Utility’s natural g as system consisted of approximately 43,100 miles of distribution pip elines, over 6,400 miles of backbone and local transmission pipelines, and v
arious storage facilities. The Utility owns and operates eight natural gas compressor st ations on its backbone transmission system andone 
small station on its local transmission system that are used to move gas through the Utility’s pipelines. The Utility’s backbone transmission system, composedprimarily of Lines 300, 400, and 401, is us
ed to transport gas from the Utility’s interconnection with interstate pipelines, other local distribution companies, andCalifornia gas fields to 
the Utility’s local transmission and distribution systems.The Utility has firm tr
ansportation agreements for delivery of natural gas from western Canada to the United States-Canada border with TransCanada NOVA GasTransmission, Ltd. interconne
cting downstream with TransCanada Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., B.C. System. The Foothills system interconnects at the border to thepipeline system owned by Gas Transmiss
ion Northwest, LLC, which provides natural gas transportation services to a point of interconnection with the Utility’snatural gas transporta
tion system on the Oregon-California border near Malin, Oregon. The Utility also has firm transportation agreements with Ruby Pipeline,LLC to transport natural gas f
rom the U.S. Rocky Mountains to the interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of Malin,Oregon, at the California bord
er. Similarly, the Utility has firm transportation agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Company, LLC and El Paso Natural GasCompany to transport natural g
as from supply points in the Southwestern United States to interconnection points with the Utility's natural gas transportation systemin the area of Californ
ia near Topock, Arizona. The Utility also has a transportation agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company to transport gas fromthe U.S. Rocky Mountains to the interconne
ction point with the Utility’s natural gas system in the area of Daggett, California. (For more information regarding theUtility’s natural gas t
ransportation agreements, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)19

The Utility owns and operates three underground natural gas storage fields and has a 25% interest in a fourth storage field, all of which are connected to theUtility’s transmission syst
em.  The Utility owns and operates compressors and other facilities at these storage fields that are used to inject gas into the fields forstorage and later withdr
awal.  In addition, four independent storage operators are interconnected to the Utility's northern California transmission system. Changesto gas storage safety requ
irements by DOGGR have led the Utility to develop and propose in its 2019 GT&S rate case application a natural gas storage strategywhich includes the discontinua
tion (through closure or sale) of operations at two gas storage fields. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7.MD&A.)
In 
2018 , the Utility continued upgrad ing transmission pipeline to allow for the use of in-line inspection tools and continued its work on the final NTSBrecommendation from 
its San Bruno investigation to hydrostatically test all high consequence pipeline mileage. The Utility currently plans to complete this NTSBrecommendation by 202
2 for remaining short pipeline segments that include tie-in pieces, fittings or smaller diameter off-takes from the larger transmissionpipelines.

CompetitionCompetition in the Electricit
y IndustryCalifornia law allows
 qualifying non-residential electric customers of investor-owned electric utilities to purchase electricity from energy service providers ratherthan from the utilit
ies up to certain annual and overall GWh limits that have been specified for each utility. This arrangement is known as “direct access.” Inaddition, California law pe
rmits cities, counties, and certain other public agencies that have qualified to become a CCA to generate and/or purchase electricity fortheir local residen
ts and businesses. By law, a CCA can procure electricity for all of its residents and businesses that do not affirmatively elect to continue toreceive electr
icity generated or procured by a utility. In 2018 the California legislature passed a bill to expand the statewide DA cap by 4,000 GWh, and directedthe CPUC to consider whether DA should be further exp
anded. The CPUC is required to issue an order implementing the expansion by June 1, 2019.The Utility continues to provid
e transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services to direct access customers, although these customers can choose to obtainmetering and billing se
rvices from their energy service provider. The CCA customers continue to obtain transmission, distribution, metering, and billing servicesfrom the Utility. In addi
tion to collecting charges for transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services that it provides, the Utility is able to collect chargesintended to recover the g
eneration-related costs that the Utility incurred on behalf of direct access and CCA customers while they were the Utility’s customers. TheUtility remains the electricity pr
ovider of last resort for these customers.The Utility is also impac
ted by the increasing viability of distributed generation and energy storage. The levels of self-generation of electricity by customers(primarily solar installations) a
nd the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits at the full retail rate, are increasing,putting upward rate pressure on 
remaining customers. New NEM customers are required to pay an interconnection fee, utilize time of use rates, and are required topay certain non-bypassable 
charges to help fund some of the costs of low income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay. Significantlyhigher bills for rema
ining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customers as they may seek alternative energy providers. The CPUC hasindicated that it in
tends to commence a new proceeding to revisit its rules related to NEM customers in 2019.Further, in some circumst
ances, governmental entities such as cities and irrigation districts, which have authority under the state constitution or state statute toprovide retail electric service, may
 seek to acquire the Utility’s distribution facilities, generally through eminent domain. These same entities may, and sometimesdo, construct duplicate dis
tribution facilities to serve existing or new Utility customers.The effect of such type
s of retail competition generally is to reduce the amount of electricity purchased by customers from the Utility.The Utility also competes 
for the opportunity to develop and construct certain types of electric transmission facilities within, or interconnected to, its serviceterritory through a comp
etitive bidding process managed by the CAISO.(For risks in connection with inc
reasing competition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.)Competition in the Natural Gas Industry
The Utility competes with oth
er natural gas pipeline companies for customers transporting natural gas into the southern California market on the basis oftransportation rates, 
access to competitively priced supplies of natural gas, and the quality and reliability of transportation services. The Utility also competes forstorage services with othe
r third-party storage providers, primarily in northern California.21

Environmental RegulationThe Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety andhealth of the Utility's pe
rsonnel and the public. These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous andradioactive substances
; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting and reduction of CO 2 and other GHG emissions; the transportation,handling, storage and disposal of sp
ent nuclear fuel; and the environmental impacts of land use, including endangered species and habitat protection. The penalties for violation of these l
aws and requirements can be severe and may include significant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions. These laws and requirementsalso may require the Uti
lity, under certain circumstances, to interrupt or curtail operations. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.) Generally, the Utility recovers most of thecosts of complying with environm
ental laws and regulations in the Utility's rates, subject to reasonableness review. Environmental costs associated with the clean-up of most sites that conta
in hazardous substances are subject to a ratemaking mechanism described in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.
Hazardous Waste Compliance and Remediation
The Utility's facilit
ies are subject to various regulations adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including the Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct and the Comprehensive Environm
ental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended. The Utility is also subject to the regulations adoptedby other federal agenc
ies responsible for implementing federal environmental laws. The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulations adoptedby the State of California 
and various state and local agencies. These federal and state laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous substance on the (1)owner or operator of the sit
e where the release occurred, (2) on companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances, and (3) insome cases, their corpor
ate successors. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, these persons (known as “potentiallyresponsible parties”) 
may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, monitoring and paying for the harm caused to naturalresources, and paying for the 
costs of health studies.The Utility has a comprehens
ive program in place to comply with these federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Under federal and California laws, the Utilitymay be responsible for re
mediation of hazardous substances even if it did not deposit those substances on the site. The Utility’s remediation activities are overseenby the California DTSC, several Cali
fornia regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies. The Utility has incurredsignificant environmen
tal remediation liabilities associated with former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, sites where natural gascompressor stations are 
located, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous substances. Groundwater at the Utility’sHinkley and Topock natural gas comp
ressor stations contains hexavalent chromium as a result of the Utility’s past operating practices. The Utility is responsiblefor remediating this g
roundwater contamination and for abating the effects of the contamination on the environment.For more information about 
environmental remediation liabilities, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Air Quality and Climate Change
The Utility's electri
c generation plants, natural gas pipeline operations, vehicle fleet, and fuel storage tanks are subject to numerous air pollution control laws,including the federal Cl
ean Air Act, as well as state and local statutes. These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, those contributing to theformation of ground-leve
l ozone, CO 2 , sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), mono-nitrogen oxide (NO x ), particulate matter, and other GHG emissions.Federal
Regulation
At the federal level, 
the EPA is charged with implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air Act. Although there have been several legislative attempts toaddress climate chang
e through imposition of nationwide regulatory limits on GHG emissions, comprehensive federal legislation has not yet been enacted. In theabsence of federal l
egislative action, the EPA has used its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to address GHG emissions.The federal administ
ration of President Donald Trump has led to significant uncertainty with regard to what further actions may occur regarding climate change atthe federal level. 
In light of the policy reversal at the federal level, the State of California has indicated that it intends to continue and enhance its leadership onclimate change nat
ionally and globally.22

State
RegulationCalifornia’s AB 32, the Global War
ming Solutions Act of 2006, provides for the gradual reduction of state-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. TheCARB has approved various regulations to ach
ieve the 2020 target, including GHG emissions reporting and a state-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade programthat sets gradually dec
lining limits (or “caps”) on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted by major GHG emission sources within different sectors of theeconomy.
The cap-and-trade progr
am’s first compliance period, which began on January 1, 2013, applied to the electric generation and large industrial sectors. The nextcompliance period, which beg
an on January 1, 2015, expanded to include the natural gas and transportation sectors, effectively covering all the economy’s majorsectors until 2020. The Utility
’s compliance obligation as a natural gas supplier applies to the GHG emissions attributable to the combustion of natural gasdelivered to the Utility’s
 customers other than natural gas delivery customers that are separately regulated as covered entities and have their own complianceobligation. During each year o
f the program, the CARB issues emission allowances (i.e., the rights to emit GHGs) equal to the amount of GHG emissions allowedfor that year. Emitt
ers can obtain allowances from the CARB at quarterly auctions or from third parties or exchanges. Emitters may also satisfy a portion of theircompliance obligation 
through the purchase of offset credits; e.g., credits for GHG reductions achieved by third parties (such as landowners, livestock owners, andfarmers) that occu
r outside of the emitters’ facilities through CARB-qualified offset projects such as reforestation or biomass projects.SB 32 (2016) requires that CARB ensures a 40% reduc
tion in greenhouse gases by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. In 2017, AB 398 extended the cap-and-tradeprogram to 2030. The Utility expe
cts all costs and revenues associated with the GHG cap-and-trade program to be passed through to customers. The CaliforniaRPS program that requires the ut
ilities to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy delivered to their customers is also expected to help reduce GHGemissions in California. In Sep
tember 2018, SB 100 was signed into law and accelerates the state’s 50% RPS target to December 31, 2026, increases the RPStarget to 60% by December 31, 2030, 
and further amends the RPS statute to set a policy of meeting 100% of retail sales from eligible renewables and zero-carbonresources by December 31, 2045.
Climate
Change
Resilience
Strateg
iesDuring 
2018 , the Utility continued its p rograms to mitigate the impact of the Utility’s operations (including customer energy usage) on the environment and toplan for the actions tha
t it will need to take to increase its resilience in light of the impacts of climate change on the Utility’s operations. The Utility regularlyreviews the most relevant
 scientific literature on climate change such as rising sea levels, major storm events, increasing temperatures and heatwaves, wildfires,drought and land subsidence, to help 
the Utility identify and evaluate climate change-related risks and develop the necessary resilience strategies. The Utilitymaintains emergency 
response plans and procedures to address a range of near-term risks, including wildfires, extreme storms, and heat waves and uses its risk-assessment process to
 prioritize infrastructure investments for longer-term risks associated with climate change. The Utility also engages with leaders frombusiness, government, academ
ia, and non-profit organizations to share information and plan for the future.The Utility is working to bette
r understand the current and future impacts of climate change. In 2017, the Utility filed its first RAMP submittal with the CPUC,which examined Utility saf
ety risks. The Climate Resilience RAMP model indicated potential additional Utility safety consequences due to climate change,including in the near te
rm. The Utility is conducting foundational work to help anticipate and plan for evolving conditions in terms of weather and climate-changerelated events. This work is guid
ing efforts to design a Utility-wide climate change risk integration strategy. This strategy will inform resource planning andinvestment, operationa
l decisions, and potential additional programs to identify and pursue mitigations that will incorporate the resilience and safety of the Utility’sassets, infrastructur
e, operations, employees, and customers.With respect to electric operation
s, climate scientists project that, sometime in the next several decades, climate change will lead to increased electricity demanddue to more extreme, pe
rsistent, and frequent hot weather. The Utility believes its strategies to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficiency and demandresponse programs, infrast
ructure improvements, and the use of renewable energy and energy storage are effective strategies for adapting to the expected changesin demand for electr
icity. The Utility is making substantial investments to build a more modern and resilient system that can better withstand extreme weather andrelated emergenc
ies. Over the long-term, the Utility also faces the risk of higher flooding and inundation potential at coastal and low elevation facilities due to sealevel rise combined with h
igh tides, storm runoff and storm surges. As the state continues to face increased risk of wildfires, the Utility’s activities, includingvegetation managemen
t, will continue to play an important role to help reduce the risk of wildfire and its impact on electric and gas facilities.23

Climate scientists predict that climate change will result in varying temperatures and levels of precipitation in the Utility’s service territory. This could, in turn,affect the Utility
’s hydroelectric generation. To plan for this potential change, the Utility is engaging with state and local stakeholders and is also adoptingstrategies such as maintaini
ng higher winter carryover reservoir storage levels, reducing discretionary reservoir water releases, and collaborating on research andnew modeling tools.
With respect to natur
al gas operations, both safety-related pipeline strength testing and normal pipeline maintenance and operations release the GHG methane intothe atmosphere. The Utili
ty has taken steps to reduce the release of methane by implementing techniques including drafting and cross-compression, which reducethe pressure and volume of na
tural gas within pipelines prior to venting.  In addition, the Utility continues to achieve reductions in methane emissions byimplementing improvements in
 leak detection and repair, upgrades at metering and regulating stations, and maintenance and replacement of other pipelinematerials.
Emissions Data
PG&E Corporation and the Utility tr
ack and report their annual environmental performance results across a broad spectrum of areas. The Utility reports its GHGemissions to the CARB and the EPA on a mandatory basis. On a vo
luntary basis, the Utility reports a more comprehensive emissions inventory to The ClimateRegistry, a non-profit organi
zation. The Utility’s third-party verified voluntary GHG inventory reported to The Climate Registry for 2017, the most recent dataavailable, totaled about
46 
million metric tonnes of CO 2 equivalent, more than three-quarters of which came from customer natural gas use. The following table shows the 2017 GHGemissions data the Utili
ty reported to the CARB under AB 32. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also publish additional GHG emissions data in their annualCorporate Responsibility and Sustain
ability Report.Source

Since the Utility purchases a portion of its electricity from the wholesale market, the Utility is not able to track some of its delivered electricity back to a specific generator. Therefore, there issome unavoidable uncertainty in the Utility’s emiss
ions rate.Air Emissions Data for Utility-Owned Generation
In addition to GHG emissions data provid
ed above, the table below sets forth information about the air emissions from the Utility’s owned generation facilities.The Utility’s owne
d generation (primarily nuclear and hydroelectric facilities) comprised more than one-half of the Utility’s delivered electricity in 2017. PG&ECorporation and the Utility a
lso publish air emissions data in their annual Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report.

Water QualityIn 2014, the E
PA issued final regulations to implement the requirements of the federal Clean Water Act that require cooling water intake structures at electricpower plants, suc
h as the nuclear generation facilities at Diablo Canyon, to reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts.Various industry and environment
al groups have challenged the federal regulations in proceedings pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.California’s once-through 
cooling policy discussed below is considered to be at least as stringent as the new federal regulations. Therefore, California’simplementation proc
ess for the state policy will likely continue without any significant change.At the state level, in 2010, th
e California Water Board adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or othersignificant measures 
to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%. The policy also provided for analternative compliance approach f
or nuclear plants if certain criteria were met. As required by the policy, the California Water Board appointed a committee toevaluate the feasib
ility and cost of using alternative technologies to achieve compliance at Diablo Canyon. The committee’s consultant submitted its final report tothe California Wate
r Board in September 2014. The report addressed feasibility, costs and timeframes to install alternative technologies at Diablo Canyon, such ascooling towers.
On June 20, 2016, the Utility entered in
to a joint proposal with certain parties to retire Diablo Canyon’s two nuclear power reactor units at the expiration of theircurrent operating li
censes in 2024 and 2025. As a result of the planned retirement, the California Water Board will no longer need to address alternativecompliance measures 
for Diablo Canyon. As required under the policy, the Utility paid an annual interim mitigation fee beginning in 2017, which it will continueto pay until operations ce
ase in 2025.Additionally, the Utility exp
ects that its decision to retire Diablo Canyon will affect the terms of a final settlement agreement between the Utility, the Central CoastBoard and the California Attorn
ey General’s Office regarding the thermal component of the plant’s once-through cooling discharge. (For more information, see“Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant” in I
tem 3. Legal Proceedings below.)Nuclear Fuel Disposal
Under the Nuclear Waste Poli
cy Act of 1982, the DOE and electric utilities with commercial nuclear power plants were authorized to enter into contracts underwhich the DOE would be required to dispose of th
e utilities’ spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by January 1998, in exchange for fees paid by theutilities’ custome
rs. The DOE has been unable to meet its contractual obligation with the Utility to dispose of nuclear waste from the Utility’s two nucleargenerating units at Diablo Canyon 
and the retired nuclear facility at Humboldt Bay. As a result, the Utility constructed interim dry cask storage facilities to store itsspent fuel onsite at Diablo Canyon 
and at Humboldt Bay until the DOE fulfills its contractual obligation to take possession of the spent fuel. The Utility and othernuclear power plant owners sued th
e DOE to recover the costs that they incurred to construct interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel.In September 2012, the U.S. Department o
f Justice and the Utility executed a settlement agreement that provided a claims process by which the Utility submitsannual requests for rei
mbursement of its ongoing spent fuel storage costs.  The claim for the period June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2018, totaled approximately $25 million and is current
ly under review by the DOE.  Amounts reimbursed by DOE are refunded to customers through rates.  A new settlement agreement, for coststhrough 2019 was executed in March 2017. Conside
rable uncertainty continues to exist regarding when and whether the DOE will meet its contractual obligation tothe Utility and other nucl
ear power plant owners to dispose of spent fuel.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accountingpolicies described in M
D&A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results.  Thefollowing discussion of key risk fa
ctors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunctionwith MD&A and the Consolidated Financial St
atements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. Any of these factors, in whole or in p
art, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows.
25

Risks Related to Chapter 11 Proceedings and LiquidityPG&E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary pet
itions for relief under Chapter 11 and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with theirbankruptcy cases.
On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. For the duration of theChapter 11 Cases, the financia
l condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be subject to various risks,including but not limited 
to the following:•
the ability to develop, consummate, and implement a plan of reorganization with respect to PG&E Corporation and the Utility during the Chapter 11Cases;
•
the ability to develop and obtain applicable Bankruptcy Court, creditor, and regulatory approval of a successful plan of reorganization and the effect ofany alternative proposa
ls, views, and objections of official committees, creditors, state and federal regulators, and other stakeholders, which may make itdifficult to develop and 
consummate a successful plan of reorganization in a timely manner;•
the ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions in the Chapter 11 Cases and the outcomes of Bankruptcy Court rulings and of theChapter 11 Cases in general;
•
risks associated with third-party motions or adversary proceedings in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with business operations, includingadditional collateral requirements,
 or the ability to formulate and implement a plan of reorganization;•
increased costs related to the Chapter 11 Cases and related litigation;•
potential for an increase in general unsecured claims as a result of the rejection of any executory contracts or unexpired leases as permitted under theBankruptcy Code;
•
the ability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for ongoing operations during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases or thereafter or to fund aplan of reorganization 
and meet future obligations, including commitments outlined in the Utility's 2020 GRC and other regulatory proceedings;•
the potential for a material decrease in the number of counterparties that are willing to engage in transactions, including commodity-related transactions,with PG&E Corporation or the Utility and 
a significant increase in the amount of collateral required to engage in any such transactions;•
the potential for a loss of, or a disruption in the materials or services received from, suppliers, contractors or service providers with whom the Utility hascommercial rel
ationships or adverse developments in the commercial and financial terms on which such providers engage in such relationships withPG&E Corporation and the Utility;
•
risks associated with the potential that the Utility will not be able to comply with the capital structure requirements authorized by the CPUC, to the extentapplicable, during the pend
ency of the Chapter 11 Cases or thereafter;•
potential increased difficulty in retaining and motivating key employees and potential increased difficulty in attracting new employees during thependency of the Chapter 11 Cases and th
ereafter;•
the significant time and effort required to be spent by senior management in dealing with the Chapter 11 Cases and restructuring activities rather thanfocusing exclusively on business ope
rations; and•
the ability to continue as a going concern.26

PG&E Corporation and the Utility will also be subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties whohave claims or inter
ests in the Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s plans. These risks and uncertainties couldmaterially aff
ect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows in various ways that cannot be predictedand may significantly in
crease the time PG&E Corporation and the Utility have to operate in Chapter 11. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with theChapter 11 Cases, it is not possible to p
redict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s financ
ial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, nor is it possible to predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during theChapter 11 Cases may have on PG&E Corporation’s 
and the Utility’s corporate and capital structure.PG&E Corporation and the Utility will b
e required to seek approvals of the Bankruptcy Court and certain regulators in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, andcertain parties m
ay object, intervene and protest approval, absent the imposition of terms or conditions to resolve their concerns. Such approvals may be denied,conditioned or delayed.
Operating under Chapter 11 may restrict the abilit
y of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to pursue strategic and operational initiatives.Under Chapter 11, transactions outs
ide the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities or to adapt to changing market orindustry conditions. These lim
itations include, among other things, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to:•
sell assets outside the normal course of business;•
make capital investments outside the normal course of business;•
consolidate or merge or sell or otherwise dispose of assets outside the normal course of business;•
grant liens; and•
finance operations, investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities, including the ability to achieve California’s renewable energygoals.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility may experience incr
eased levels of employee attrition as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases.As a result of the filing of 
the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may experience increased levels of employee attrition, and their employees willlikely face consider
able distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could materially affect PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s financ
ial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to engage, motivate and retainkey employees or take othe
r measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with PG&E Corporation or the Utility, as applicable, throughthe pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases 
is limited by restrictions on implementation of retention and incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss ofservices of members of s
enior management could impair PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to execute their strategies and implement operationalinitiatives, which would like
ly have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s historica
l financial information may not be indicative of future financialperformance.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan of reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court.Under fresh-start accoun
ting rules that may apply to PG&E Corporation and the Utility upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization, their assets andliabilities would be adjus
ted to fair value. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition and resultsof operations following eme
rgence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in their historicalfinancial statem
ents. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of a plan of reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring andrelated charges may b
e identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,results of operations, liqu
idity, and cash flows.27

If PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not able to develop and consummate a consensual plan of reorganization, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sfinancial condition, results of operations, liquid
ity, and cash flows could be materially affected by a protracted restructuring.PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
commenced the Chapter 11 Cases without the benefit of a restructuring support agreement or agreed consensual plan ofreorganization with any of 
its creditors or other key constituents. The Bankruptcy Code gives PG&E Corporation and the Utility the exclusive right to file a plan ofreorganization for 120 days 
after the filing and, subject to extension for cause, up to a maximum of 18 months from the Petition Date, and prohibits creditors,equity security holders and o
thers from proposing a plan of reorganization during this period. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have currently retained theexclusive right to fil
e a plan of reorganization until at least May 29, 2019. If that right is terminated, however, or the exclusivity period is not extended or expires,there could be a mate
rial effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to achieve confirmation of a plan of reorganization that would enable PG&ECorporation and the Utility to 
reach their stated goals.Accordingly, no assurance can be p
rovided as to the length of time during which the Chapter 11 Cases will be pending, whether a consensual or other plan ofreorganization can be su
ccessfully developed and consummated, what the terms of any reorganization of PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be, and whateffect any such plan or r
eorganization would have on the capital structure (or any part thereof) of PG&E Corporation and the Utility or on any of their respectiveequity, debt and other stakeho
lders, including as to matters of taxation and recovery or distributions upon consummation of any plan of reorganization.If PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
are not able to develop and consummate a consensual plan of reorganization within the exclusivity period, one or more thirdparties may propose a comp
eting plan of reorganization. PG&E Corporation and the Utility may have limited ability to prevent an alternative plan ofreorganization from b
eing approved by the Bankruptcy Court, even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe such plan is in their best interest and thebest interests of thei
r stakeholders. Even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility are successful in obtaining confirmation of a plan of reorganization following theexpiration of their ex
clusivity period, the process may be lengthy, costly and disruptive. A contested plan of reorganization proceeding would likely have a morepronounced material e
ffect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows than a consensual plan ofreorganization. Even if PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility are able to obtain requisite stakeholder approval, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm a plan ofreorganization.
The uncertainty surrounding a p
rolonged restructuring would also have other material effects on PG&E Corporation and the Utility including, but not limited to:•
the ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to raise additional capital;•
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liquidity;•
how PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business is viewed by regulators, investors, lenders and credit ratings agencies;•
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s enterprise value; and•
PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's ability to continue as a going concern.PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be subject to c
laims that will not be discharged in their Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility’s financial condit
ion, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Bankruptcy Code provides that the 
confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all claims arising prior to its filing underChapter 11. With few exceptions, 
all claims that arose prior to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Chapter 11 Cases: (i) would be subject to compromise and/ortreatment under the p
lan of reorganization and (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Anyclaims not ultimately discharge
d through a plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows on a post-reorganization basis and may cast substantial doubt onPG&E Corporation's and the Utility's abi
lity to continue as a going concern.28

The DIP Facilities may be insufficient to fund PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s cash requirements through their emergence from bankruptcy.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
liquidity, including PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to meet their ongoing operational obligations, is dependentupon, among other things: (i) PG&E Corpora
tion’s and the Utility’s ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any post-petition financing and cashcollateral order 
entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, including the financing orders entered with respect to the DIP CreditAgreement, (ii) PG&E Corporation
’s and the Utility’s ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iii) PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to generate cashflow from operations, (iv) PG&E Corpor
ation’s and the Utility’s ability to develop, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization or other alternativerestructuring transa
ction and (v) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and theUtility will be subject to v
arious risks, including but not limited to (i) the inability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for operations or to fund anyplan of reorganization 
and meet future obligations, and (ii) increased legal and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and thereorganization.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. As a result of the Bankruptcy Court’s interim approval of the DIP CreditAgreement on January 31, 2019 and the sa
tisfaction of the other conditions thereof, the DIP Credit Agreement became effective on February 1, 2019, and a portionof the DIP Revolving Facility in the 
amount of $1.5 billion (including $750 million of the letter of credit subfacility) was made available to PG&E Corporation andthe Utility. As of February 28, 2019, the r
emainder of the DIP Revolving Facility (including the remainder of the $1.5 billion letter of credit subfacility), the DIPInitial Term Loan Faci
lity and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility are unavailable for borrowing and will remain unavailable until and unless theBankruptcy Court approves the avai
lability thereof following a final hearing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the date of the final hearing,but it is currently schedu
led for March 13, 2019. There can be no assurances that the Bankruptcy Court will grant final approval of the DIP Facilities at the finalhearing, or at all. For mor
e information on the DIP Credit Agreement, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.The DIP Credit Agreement will ma
ture on December 31, 2020, subject to the Utility’s option to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain terms andconditions are satisfi
ed, including the payment of an extension fee.PG&E Corporation and the Utility will 
face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of their liquidity and capital resources during the pendency of the Chapter 11Cases, and will have limited, 
if any, access to additional financing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot provide assurance that cash on hand, cash flow fromoperations, distributions r
eceived from their subsidiaries and borrowings available under the DIP Credit Agreement will be sufficient to continue to fund operationsduring the pendency of the Chapte
r 11 Cases. The ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to maintain adequate liquidity depends in part upon industryconditions and general econo
mic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond their control. In the event that cash on hand, cash flow fromoperations, distributions r
eceived from subsidiaries and availability under the DIP Credit Agreement are not sufficient to meet these liquidity needs, PG&ECorporation and the Utility m
ay be required to seek additional financing, and can provide no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available,offered on acceptable terms.
The DIP Credit Agreement imposes a number of restric
tions on PG&E Corporation and the Utility that may, among other things, limit their ability to conducttheir business, or pursue new business opportunities and strategies. Additionally, 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to comply wi th thecovenants imposed by the DIP Credit Agreement. Such non-complianc
e could result in an event of default under the DIP Credit Agreement that, if not curedor waived, could have a material eff
ect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The DIP Credit Agreement imposes a nu
mber of restrictions on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including, among other things, affirmative covenants requiringPG&E Corporation and the Utility to prov
ide financial information, cash flow forecasts, variance reports and other information to the administrative agent. TheDIP Credit Agreement also conta
ins general affirmative covenants such as compliance with all applicable laws, maintenance of licenses from necessarygovernmental authorit
ies, maintenance of property and preservation of corporate existence. Negative covenants contained in the DIP Credit Agreement includerestrictions on PG&E Corporation’s 
and the Utility’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loansor advances, engage in merg
ers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions, and make payments in respect of junior or pre-petition indebtedness, in e
ach case subject to customary exceptions. The Utility’s ability to borrow under the DIP Credit Agreement is subject to the satisfaction ofcertain customary cond
itions precedent set forth therein. For more information on the DIP Credit Agreement, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.
29

As a result of these covenants and restrictions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be limited in their ability to conduct their business, and respond to changingbusiness, market, and economi
c conditions. These provisions may also limit PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to pursue new business opportunities andstrategies.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond their control and their failure to comply, or obtaina waiver in the event PG&E Corporat
ion or the Utility cannot comply with a covenant, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing the DIPCredit Agreement that, i
f not cured or waived, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to obtain ex
it financing to, among other things, repay borrowings under the DIP Credit Agreement, andeven if they are able to obtain such exi
t financing, the agreement governing such exit financing may significantly restrict PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financing and operational flex
ibility. The ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to emerge from bankruptcy will likely depend on obtainingfinancings from a number of potential sources, and there can be no assurance that any such financings or other po
tential sources can be obtainedexpeditiously or on favorable terms, 
if at all.It is expected that th
e DIP Credit Agreement will be repaid using, in whole or in part, the proceeds from borrowings under exit financings. PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s abili
ty to obtain such exit financing will depend on, among other things, the timing and outcome of various ongoing matters in the Chapter 11Cases, their business, operations 
and financial condition, and market conditions. There can be no assurance that PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be able toobtain such exit financings on 
reasonable economic terms, or at all. If exit financing cannot be obtained, they may not be able to repay the DIP Credit Agreement atmaturity or emerge 
from bankruptcy. Any exit financing that PG&E Corporation and the Utility are able to obtain may include a number of significant restrictiveor financial covenants 
which could impair their financial and operational flexibility and make it difficult to react to market conditions and satisfy their ongoingcapital needs and unantici
pated cash requirements.The ability of PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility to emerge from bankruptcy will likely depend on proceeds received from a number of potential sources. Thesepotential sources may in
clude financings in the capital and credit markets, securitization, proceeds of asset sales or other dispositions, and other potential sources.The ability to execute on 
any such financings or other potential sources will be subject to a variety of factors, many of which will be beyond the control of PG&ECorporation and the Utility, and 
may require consent or other action of federal and state regulators (including the FERC and the CPUC), the state legislature andexecutive branch, the Bankrup
tcy Court, other governmental entities, and other potential sources of third-party financing. There can be no assurance that any suchfinancings or other potent
ial sources can be obtained expeditiously or on favorable terms, if at all.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statem
ents have been prepared assuming that PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continueas a going concern.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, resul
ts of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential lossesresulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp f
ire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resultingfrom the impact of th
e 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. As detailed below inNote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financ
ial Statements in Item 8, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to numerous lawsuits in connection with the2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern Califo
rnia wildfires by various plaintiffs, including wildfire victims, insurance carriers, and various government entities, undermultiple theories of liability.
 These lawsuits generally assert that the Utility’s alleged failure to maintain and repair its distribution and transmission lines andfailure to properly m
aintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.Due to the commencement o
f the Chapter 11 Cases, these plaintiffs have been stayed from continuing to prosecute pending litigation and from commencing newlawsuits against PG&E Corporation or th
e Utility on account of pre-petition obligations. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s obligations with respect to suchclaims are expect
ed to be determined through the Chapter 11 process. If the Utility’s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, aredetermined to be the subst
antial cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage,business interruption, inte
rest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a materialadverse effect on PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility, including on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's ability to develop and consummate a successful plan ofreorganization. (See “Th
e doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation or the Utility are subject, couldsignificantly expand the
 potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows” below.) In addition to such claims for property damage, business interruption, interest, and attorneys’ fees, the Utility couldbe liable for fire supp
ression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury damages, punitive damages, and other damages under other theories ofliability, including i
f the Utility were found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a material adverse effect onPG&E Corporation and the Utility, inc
luding on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization.Among other things, it is uncert
ain at this time as to the number of wildfire-related claims that will be filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, the number of current andfuture claims that wi
ll be settled in a plan of reorganization, how claims for punitive damages and claims by variously situated persons will be treated and whethersuch claims will be allo
wed, and the impact that historical settlement values for wildfire claims may have on the estimation of wildfire liability in the Chapter 11Cases.
Further, the Utility could be sub
ject to material fines or penalties if the CPUC or any law enforcement agency brought an enforcement action, including a criminalproceeding, and determin
ed that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Such actions would not be subject to the automatic stay.31

As described below in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, based on information made available by the California Department ofInsurance, insurers have r
eceived an aggregate amount of approximately $18.4 billion of insurance claims made as of the dates noted below related to the 2018Camp fire and 2017 Northern Califo
rnia wildfires. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect that additional claims have been submitted and will continue to besubmitted to insurers, par
ticularly with respect to the 2018 Camp fire. These claims reflect insured property losses only. The $18.4 billion of insurance claimsdescribed below does not account 
for uninsured or underinsured property losses, interest, attorneys’ fees, fire suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs,personal injury or wrongful dea
th damages, medical expenses or other costs, such as potential punitive damages, fines or penalties, or damages for claims related tothe 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern Cal
ifornia wildfires that have not manifested yet ("future claims"), each of which could be significant and could materiallyaffect the financ
ial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. The scope of all claims related to the 2018Camp fire and 2017 Northern Califo
rnia wildfires is not known at this time because of the applicable statutes of limitations under California law. PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process.If PG&E Corporation or the Utility we
re to be found liable for certain or all of the costs, expenses and other losses described above with respect to the 2018 Campfire and 2017 Northern Californ
ia wildfires, the amount of such liability could exceed $30 billion, which amount does not include potential punitive damages, finesand penalties or damages 
related to future claims. In certain circumstances, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability could be substantially greater than suchamount. As a result, PG&E Corporation’s and 
the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.Potential liabilit
ies related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires depend on various factors, including but not limited to the cause of eachfire, contributing caus
es of the fires (including alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged ordestroyed, the contents of such s
tructures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants,the nature and extent of 
any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs,other damages the Utili
ty may be responsible for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities. Thereare a number of unknown facts and 
legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims thatmay be asserted against PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility and the treatment of such claims in the Chapter 11 Cases.For more information about 
the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, see “2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires” in Note 13of the Notes to Consolidated Financi
al Statements in Item 8.PG&E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of lawsuits and could be 
the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions inconnection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e the subject of a number of lawsuits that have been filed against PG&E Corporation and the Utility in Sonoma, Napa and SanFrancisco Counties’ Superior Courts in 
connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, several of which seek to be certified as classactions, asserting damag
es that include wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, evacuation costs, medical expenses, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees,and other damages. Insuranc
e carriers who have made payments to their insureds for property damage arising out of the 2017 Northern California wildfires havefiled 48 subrogation compla
ints in the San Francisco County Superior Court as of January 28, 2019. These complaints allege, among other things, negligence,inverse condemnation, tr
espass and nuisance.  The allegations are similar to the ones made by individual plaintiffs. Insurance carriers have filed 37 similarsubrogation complaints with r
espect to the 2018 Camp fire in the Sacramento County Superior Court. Further, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have been namedas defendants in securit
ies class action litigation related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2018 Camp fire.Due to the commencement o
f the Chapter 11 Cases, these plaintiffs have been stayed from continuing to prosecute pending litigation and from commencing newlawsuits against PG&E Corporation or th
e Utility on account of pre-petition obligations. However, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject ofadditional lawsuits on accoun
t of obligations arising after the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases or the Bankruptcy Court could lift the automatic stay withrespect to such pre-pet
ition obligations. Further, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcementactions in connection with th
e 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. The wildfire litigation could take a number of years to be resolved throughthe Chapter 11 process because o
f the complexity of the matters, including the ongoing investigation into the causes of the fires and the growing number of partiesand claims involved. The ult
imate number and allowed amount of such claims are not presently known and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.32

If PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for any punitive damages or subject to fines or penalties in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and2017 Northern California wildfires, their financial condit
ion, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.If PG&E Corporation or the Utility we
re to be found liable for any punitive damages or subject to fines or penalties, the amount of such punitive damages, finesand penalties could be signi
ficant and could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows, as well as PG&E Corporation's and the Uti
lity’s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization. The Utility has received significantfines and penalties in conn
ection with past incidents. For example, in 2015, the CPUC approved a decision that imposed penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6billion in connection with na
tural gas explosion that occurred in the City of San Bruno on September 9, 2010 (the “San Bruno explosion”). These penaltiesrepresented nearly th
ree times the underlying liability for the San Bruno explosion of approximately $558 million incurred for third-party claims, exclusive ofshareholder derivativ
e lawsuits and legal costs incurred. The amount of punitive damages, fines and penalties imposed on PG&E Corporation or the Utility couldlikewise be a significan
t amount in relation to the underlying liabilities with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.The amount of potential losses resulting from the 
impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is expected to greatly exceed theamount of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s insurance coverage for wi
ldfire events and securing liability insurance in future years is expected to beincreasingly difficult and expensiv
e, if available at all.The amount of potential loss
es resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is expected to greatly exceed the amount ofPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
insurance coverage for wildfire events. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have $842 million of insurance coverage forliabilities, includ
ing wildfire events, for the period from August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018, subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million peroccurrence and furthe
r retentions of approximately $40 million per occurrence. During the third quarter of 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility renewed theirliability insurance 
coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 billion for the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019,comprised of $700 million fo
r general liability (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence), and $700 million for property damagesonly, which property damage cove
rage includes an aggregate amount of approximately $200 million through the reinsurance market where a catastrophe bond wasutilized. In addition, cov
erage limits within these wildfire insurance policies could result in further material self-insured costs in the event each fire were deemed tobe a separate occurr
ence under the terms of the insurance policies.PG&E Corporation and the Utility may no
t be able to recover the full amount of their insurance. If PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to recover the fullamount of their insuranc
e, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.Even if PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty were to recover the full amount of their insurance, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect their losses in connectionwith the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern Ca
lifornia wildfires will greatly exceed their available insurance.In addition, it could take 
a number of years before the Utility’s final liability in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires isknown and the Utility could apply for 
recovery of costs in excess of insurance. While the CPUC has authorized the Utility to track certain wildfire costs in itsWEMA, the Utility will be requi
red to submit a separate request with the CPUC in the future for recovery of those costs.  The Utility may be unable to fullyrecover costs in excess of 
insurance through regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take a number of years to resolve and a numberof years to collect.
If PG&E Corporation or the Utility we
re to be found liable for certain or all of the costs, expenses, and other losses described above with respect to the 2018 Campfire and 2017 Northern Californ
ia wildfires, the amount of such liability could exceed $30 billion, which amount does not include potential punitive damages, finesand penalties or damages 
related to future claims. In certain circumstances, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability could be substantially greater than suchamount. For further discussion of 
the potential magnitude of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability, see “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017Northern California wildfi
res, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases” and “PG&E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of lawsuits andcould be the subject of addi
tional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern Californiawildfires” above.

Accordingly, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect losses in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires will greatly exceedtheir available insu
rance. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also expect to face increasing difficulty securing liability insurance in future years due to availabilityand to face significan
tly increased insurance costs. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determinedthrough the Chapter 11 process.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, resul
ts of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amountof third-party liability o
f the Utility in connection with the 2015 Butte fire.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount ofthird-party liabil
ity that the Utility incurs in connection with the 2015 Butte fire. As described below in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsin Item 8, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity are subject to numerous lawsuits in connection with the 2015 Butte fire by various plaintiffs, including individualplaintiffs, insurance 
carriers, and various government entities, under multiple theories of liability. Plaintiffs also seek punitive damages. The number of individualclaimants may stil
l increase in the future through the Chapter 11 process.In connection with the 2015 Butte f
ire, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, throughthe doctrine of inverse 
condemnation. (See “The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation or the Utility aresubject, could significa
ntly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,results of operations, liqu
idity, and cash flows” below.) In addition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damagesif the Utility were found to h
ave been negligent. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determinedthrough the Chapter 11 process. Whi
le the Utility believes it was not negligent, there can be no assurance that a court would agree with the Utility.The Utility currently be
lieves that it is probable that it will incur a loss of $1.1 billion in connection with the 2015 Butte fire. While this amount includes theUtility’s assumptions about f
ire suppression costs (including its assessment of the Cal Fire loss), it does not include any portion of the estimated claim from theOES. The Utility still does not have suf
ficient information to reasonably estimate the probable loss it may have for that additional claim. A change inmanagement’s estim
ates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity, and cash flows, as well as PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan ofreorganization. (See Note 13 o
f the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)If the Utility is unable to recov
er all or a significant portion of its excess costs in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfiresand the 2015 Butte fire through ratemaking mechanisms and in a timel
y manner, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and cash flows could be mater
ially affected.As of December 31, 2018, the Utility in
curred substantial costs in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Buttefire in excess of costs cu
rrently in rates, some of which currently are or are expected to be recorded in the future in its WEMA, CEMA and FHPMA accounts.There can be no assurance th
at the Utility will be allowed to recover costs recorded in those accounts in the future, even if a court decision were to determine thatthe Utility is liable 
as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. For example, while the CPUC previously approved WEMA trackingaccounts for San Diego Gas & Elect
ric Company in 2010, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company stated itincurred as a result of 
the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC’sprudent manager standard. San Di
ego Gas & Electric, the Utility, and Southern California Edison filed requests for rehearing of that decision. On July 12, 2018,the CPUC voted out a decision denying the requ
ests for rehearing. On November 13, 2018, the California Court of Appeal denied San Diego Gas & Electric’spetition for writ of rev
iew, and on January 30, 2019, the California Supreme Court denied San Diego Gas & Electric’s petition for review.34

SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a customer harm threshold, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances inthe aggregate, so that th
ey do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming ratepayers or materially impacting its ability to provideadequate and safe servi
ce (the “Customer Harm Threshold”). SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through theissuance of recovery bonds (a
lso referred to as “securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017Northern California wildfi
res, any amounts in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. SB 901 does not authorize securitization with respect to possible 2018Camp fire costs, as the bil
l does not address fires that occurred in 2018.On January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a pro
cess to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the CustomerHarm Threshold in future appl
ications under Section 451.2(a) of the Public Utilities Code for cost recovery of 2017 wildfire costs. In the OIR, the CPUC statedthat “consistent with Sect
ion 451.2(a), the determination of what costs and expenses are just and reasonable must be made in the context of an application for therecovery of specific 
costs related to the 2017 wildfires.” Based on the CPUC’s interpretation of Section 451.2 as outlined in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and theUtility believe that 
any securitization of costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires would not occur, if at all, until (a) the Utility has paid claimsrelating to the 2017 Northern Ca
lifornia wildfires, (b) the Utility has filed application for recovery of such costs, and (c) the CPUC makes a determination that suchcosts are just and reasonab
le or in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. PG&E Corporation and the Utility therefore do not expect the CPUC to permit theUtility to securitiz
e costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires on an expedited or emergency basis. Based on the OIR, as well as prior experience andprecedent, and unless the CPUC alters 
the position expressed in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it likely would take years to obtainauthorization to secur
itize any amounts relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires.On February 11, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed opening comments in response to the OIR in which they argued, among other things, the CPUCshould (1) promptly set a Custome
r Harm Threshold, or at least define the methodology for setting the Customer Harm Threshold with sufficient specificity toenable PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity and potential investors to anticipate that amount; (2) determine the Customer Harm Threshold based on the capitalneeded to resolve clai
ms arising from both the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires to be provided for in a plan of reorganization; (3) definehow the Customer Harm Threshold will be 
applied to any future wildfires; and (4) establish the Customer Harm Threshold based on the amount of debt PG&ECorporation and the Utility c
an raise. Based on assumptions set forth in the comments, PG&E Corporation and the Utility indicated that they could borrow up toapproximately $3 billion 
to fund wildfire claims costs as part of a plan of reorganization.The inability to recove
r all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collecting such rates in a timely manner couldhave a material e
ffect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, resul
ts of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-compliance with the terms of probation or in the 
event of modifications to the conditions of probation.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-compliance with the te
rms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation. On January 26, 2017, following the federal criminal trialagainst the Utility in conn
ection with the San Bruno explosion, in which the Utility was found guilty on six felony counts, the Utility was sentenced to, amongother things, a five-yea
r corporate probation period and oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early terminationafter three years. Th
e probation includes a requirement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of theprobation, the Utility has r
etained a third-party monitor at the Utility’s expense. The goal of the third-party monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takesreasonable and appropriate
 steps to maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentiveprograms on a Utility-wide bas
is.35

In 2018 and 2019, the court overseeing the Utility’s probation, issued various orders related to the Utility’s probation. On November 27, 2018, the court issued anorder requiring that th
e Utility, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California and the third-party monitor provide written answers to aseries of questions regard
ing the Utility’s compliance with the terms of its probation. On December 5, 2018, the court issued an order requesting that the Office ofthe California Attorney Gene
ral advise the court of its view on “the extent to which, if at all, the reckless operation or maintenance of PG&E power lines wouldconstitute a crime und
er California law.” The response of the Utility was submitted on December 31, 2018. On January 3, 2019 and January 4, 2019, the courtissued two new orders requesting fur
ther information regarding each of the eighteen October 2017 Northern California wildfires that Cal Fire has attributed to theUtility’s facilit
ies, and the Utility submitted its responses on January 10, 2019. On January 9, 2019, the court ordered the Utility to appear in court on January 30,2019, as a result of the court
’s finding that “there is probable cause to believe there has been a violation of the conditions of supervision” with respect to reportingrequirements rela
ted to the 2017 Honey fire. In addition, on January 9, 2019, the court issued an order proposing to add new conditions of probation and orderedthe Utility to show cause by January 23, 2019, 
as to why the Utility’s conditions of probation should not be modified as proposed. The Utility's response wassubmitted on January 23, 2019. On January 30, 2019, the 
court found that the Utility had violated a condition of its probation with respect to reportingrequirements rela
ted to the 2017 Honey fire. The court issued an order stating that a sentencing hearing on the probation violation will be set at a later date. Formore information about 
the Utility’s probation and the court’s orders, see “U.S. District Court Matters and Probation" in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and "U.S.District Court Matters and Prob
ation” in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Such proceedings are not subject to the automaticstay imposed as a result of 
the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases.The Utility could incur ma
terial costs, not recoverable through rates, in the event of non-compliance with the terms of its probation and in connection with themonitorship (including but not 
limited to costs resulting from recommendations of the third-party monitor). The Utility could also incur material costs, notrecoverable through ra
tes, in the event of modifications to the conditions of its probation.The Utility’s conviction and 
the outcome of probation could harm the Utility’s relationships with customers, regulators, legislators, communities, businesspartners, or other consti
tuencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management. Further, they could negatively affect the outcomeof future ratemaking 
and regulatory proceedings, for example, by enabling parties to argue that the Utility should not be allowed to recover costs that the partiesallege are somehow rel
ated to the criminal charges on which the Utility was found guilty. They could also result in increased regulatory or legislative scrutiny withrespect to various aspec
ts of how the Utility’s business is conducted or organized. (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.)The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if appl
ied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand thepotential liabilities 
from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, andcash flows.
California law includes a do
ctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liabilityfor attorneys’ fees) 
for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities’ electric transmission lines. Courtshave imposed liability und
er the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the grounds that losses borne bythe person whose property was damaged 
through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefitted from such undertaking, and basedon the assumption that util
ities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers. Plaintiffs have asserted the doctrine of inverse condemnation inlawsuits related to the 2018 Ca
mp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire, and it is possible that plaintiffs could be successful inconvincing courts to apply this do
ctrine in these or other litigations. For example, on June 22, 2017, the Superior Court for the County of Sacramento found thatthe doctrine of inverse 
condemnation applies to the Utility with respect to the 2015 Butte fire. Although the Utility has filed a renewed motion for a legaldetermination of inverse co
ndemnation liability, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in its arguments that the doctrine of inversecondemnation does not apply in th
e 2015 Butte fire or other litigation against PG&E Corporation or the Utility.Furthermore, a court could d
etermine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies even in the absence of an open CPUC proceeding for cost recovery, orbefore a potential cos
t recovery decision is issued by the CPUC. Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability toautomatically re
cover these costs from their customers, there can be no guarantee that the CPUC would authorize cost recovery whether or not a previous courtdecision imposes liabil
ity on a utility under the doctrine of inverse condemnation. In December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas &Electric Company stated 
it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are notrelevant to the CPUC’s prudent manag
er standard. That determination is being challenged by San Diego Gas & Electric as well as by the Utility and SouthernCalifornia Edison.
36

If PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for damage under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, but is unable to secure a cost recovery decisionfrom the CPUC to pay for such costs through inc
reases in rates or to collect such rates in a timely manner, the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,and cash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity would be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017Northern California wildfi
res. (See “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materiallyaffected by potentia
l losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of theChapter 11 Cases”, “PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility are the subject of lawsuits and could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines orenforcement actions 
in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires” and “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount of third-party liability of the Utility in connectionwith the 2015 Butte fire” above.)
Risks Related to the Outcome of Other Enforc
ement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory ProceedingsPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could b
e materially affected as a result of legislative and regulatory developments.The Utility’s financia
l results could be materially affected as a result of SB 901 adopted in 2018 by the California legislature. In December 2018, the CPUC openedan OIR in connection with SB 901 that will adopt 
criteria and a methodology for use by the CPUC in future applications for cost recovery of wildfire costs.Following SB 901, in applications for cost r
ecovery in connection with the 2017 wildfires, the CPUC is expected to consider the Utility’s financial status anddetermine the maximum amount t
he Utility can pay without harming customers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safe service, and ensurethat the costs or expenses th
at are disallowed for recovery in rates assessed for the wildfires, in the aggregate, do not exceed that amount. The Utility is unable topredict the timing or ou
tcome of such future determination by the CPUC and its impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows.In addition, SB 901 requires utili
ties to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the CPUC on a schedule to be established by the CPUC.  SB 901establishes factors to b
e considered by the CPUC when setting penalties for failure to substantially comply with the plan.  The Utility is unable to predict the timingor outcome of the CPUC’s review of the wild
fire mitigation plan, the results of the CPUC compliance review of wildfire mitigation plan implementation, or thetiming or extent of cost 
recovery for wildfire mitigation plan activities. (See “Regulatory Matters - Other Regulatory Proceedings” in Item 7. MD&A.)Finally, SB 901 established a Commission on Cat
astrophic Wildfire Cost and Recovery to evaluate wildfire reforms, including inverse condemnation reform, apotential state wildf
ire insurance fund, and other wildfire mitigation measures. The recommendations of the CPUC and the response by the Governor andlegislature to those r
ecommendations could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows. (See “Regulatory Matte
rs - Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives” in Item 7. MD&A.)The Utility is subject to ext
ensive regulations and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with such regulations, PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial condition, resul
ts of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC’s investigativeenforcement proceedings against the Util
ity, other known enforcement matters, and other ongoing state and federal investigations and requests forinformation. The Utility could incur mater
ial costs and fines in connection with compliance with penalties from closed investigations or enforcement actions orin connection with future investigations, citat
ions, audits, or enforcement actions.The Utility is subject to ex
tensive regulations, including federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcementproceedings in connection with su
ch regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with the ex parte OII,safety culture OII, the 
locate and mark OII, and other matters that the CPUC’s SED may be investigating. The SED could launch investigations at any time on anyissue it deems appropria
te. Such proceedings are likely not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases;however, collection effo
rts in connection with fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.37

The SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation, but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutorypenalty of $50,000, with an administ
rative limit of $8 million per citation issued. For offenses occurred after January 1, 2019, the maximum statutory penalty is$100,000, as provided in SB 901. The SED may, at its discre
tion, impose penalties on a daily basis, or on less than a daily basis, for violations that continued formore than one day. While i
t is uncertain how the CPUC will calculate the number of violations or the penalty for any violations, such fines or penalties could besignificant and mate
rially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liquidity and results of operations. (See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1. Business andNote 14 to the Consolidated Financia
l Statements in Item 8.)The Utility also is a targ
et of a number of investigations, in addition to certain investigations in connection with the wildfires. (See "Risks Related to Wildfires,"above.) In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office 
in San Francisco and the California Attorney General's office opened investigations into matters related toallegedly improper co
mmunication between the Utility and CPUC personnel. The Utility also is unable to predict the outcome of, or costs and expenses associatewith, pending investigations, inc
luding whether any charges will be brought against the Utility.If these investigations 
result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties the amount of which could be substantialand, in the event of a judgmen
t against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations,or future enforcement actions
, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; forexample, by enabling part
ies to challenge the Utility’s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility’s violations. (See also“PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-compliance with the te
rms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation” above.)The Utility could be subject 
to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws,regulations or orders tha
t could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacyrequirements; customer billing;
 customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safetyand inspection practic
es; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; andenvironmental compli
ance. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safetycitation programs. The a
mount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity, and cash flows.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results pri
marily depend on the outcomes of regulatory and ratemaking proceedings and the Utility’s ability tomanage its operating expenses and capital expendi
tures so that it is able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner.As a regulated entity, the Ut
ility’s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficientrevenues to recover re
asonable costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial resultscould be materially 
affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn itsauthorized ROE. The outcome of the Ut
ility’s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties;potential rate imp
acts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility’sregulators, consumer and oth
er stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility’s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gasservices. Further, the inc
reasing amount of Reliability Must Run (“RMR”) electric generation in the CAISO could increase the Utility’s costs of procuring capacityneeded for reliable s
ervice to its customers.In addition to the amount of 
authorized revenues, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility’s actual costs tosafely and reliably se
rve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing marketcircumstances, unanti
cipated events (such as wildfires, storms, earthquakes, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility’s operations), orcompliance with new state 
laws or policies. Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial time lagbetween when the Utility incurs 
the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs. Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC maydisallow costs that they det
ermine were not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility.38

The Utility also is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of astate-wide electric vehicle chargin
g infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energyefficiency programs, 
energy storage and renewable energy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the California high-speed rail project. TheUtility’s ability to r
ecover costs, including its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will depend, in large part, on thefinal form of legislative or re
gulatory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect a lower customer demandfor the Utility’s electricity an
d natural gas services.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results dep
end upon the Utility’s continuing ability to recover “pass-through” costs, including electricity andnatural gas procurement costs, from customers in a ti
mely manner. The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In addition, theUtility’s ability to r
ecover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth, if the CPUC fails to adjust theUtility’s rates to refl
ect such events.The Utility meets customer
 demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility’s own generation facilities, electricityprovided by third parties unde
r power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market.  The Utility must manage these sources using thecommercial and CPUC regulatory p
rinciples of “least cost dispatch” and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procur
ement plan. The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not complywith these principles or i
f the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan.Further, the contractual 
prices for electricity under the Utility’s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a varietyof reasons, including developm
ents in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lowercustomer demand due to adve
rse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility’s customers to other retail providers. Despite the CPUC’s current approval of thecontracts, the CPUC could disallow contr
act costs in the future if it determines that the terms of such contracts, including price, do not meet the CPUCreasonableness standard.
The Utility’s ability to 
recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continuesto function effectively. 
Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems andsoftware on which the market 
mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices.  The CPUC could prohibit the Utilityfrom passing through the higher 
costs of electricity to customers.Further, PG&E Corporation’s and the Util
ity’s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs throughmunicipalization of 
the Utility’s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number ofconsumers who become direct 
access customers of alternative generation providers. (See “Competition in the Electricity Industry” in Item 1.) As the number ofbundled customers (i.e., those 
customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increaseas the Utility would have a sma
ller customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs. Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassablecharges for above market 
generation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover thesecosts. In addition, the Utili
ty’s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups. Furthermore, ifthe former customers return t
o receiving electricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able totimely recover through rates
 or that it may not be able to recover at all.In addition, increasing l
evels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customers to 
receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers, who may incur significantlyhigher bills due to an incr
ease in customers seeking alternative energy providers.39

A confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage aviable, cost-effective alternative to
 the Utility’s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility’s ability to recover its generation, transmission,and distribution investmen
ts. If the number of the Utility’s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility’s level of authorized capitalinvestment could declin
e as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due tocustomer migration to o
ther energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation,unless substantially offse
t through regulatory cost allocations, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business, financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows. 
Further, changes in commodity p
rices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility’s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE. Although the Utility general
ly recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as “pass-through” costs, a significant and sustained rise incommodity prices could create
 overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as “pass-through” costs. To relieve some of this upward 
rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery.If the Utility is unable 
to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of changingloads, the wide deployment of dis
tributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies, PG&E Corporation’s andthe Utility’s financi
al condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology
The Utility’s electri
city and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks which, if they materialize, can materially affectPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, resul
ts of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility owns and operates ext
ensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generatingsystem.  (See “Electri
c Utility Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations” in Item 1. Business above.)  The Utility’s ability to earn its authorized ROEdepends on its abilit
y to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably.  The Utilityundertakes substantial ca
pital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities.  In addition, the Utility is obligated todecommission its elec
tricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives, and the CPUC approved retirement of Diablo Canyon by 2024 and 2025.The Utility’s ability to s
afely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond theUtility’s control, includ
ing those that arise from:•
the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can causeexplosions, fires, or other c
atastrophic events;•
an overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow correct operatingprocedures, or welding or fabr
ication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or distribution assets anduncontained natural gas f
low;•
the failure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gasoutages, gas surges back into homes, s
erious personal injury or loss of life;•
a prolonged statewide electrical black-out that results in damage to the Utility’s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other thirdparties;
•
the failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for employees or the public, environmentaldamage, or reputationa
l damage;•
the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act;•
the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility’s assets are built;40

•the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonablyshould have identified, as unsa
fe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas explosion);•
inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm orextended outages;
•
operator or other human error;•
an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudently;•
construction performed by third parties that damages the Utility’s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or “dig-ins” that damage the Uti
lity’s underground pipelines;•
the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking lead-based paint from the 
Utility’s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and•
attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war.    
The occurrence of any 
of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generatingoutput; damage the Utili
ty’s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customersor others; and cause persona
l injury or death.  As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and tocompensate third part
ies.  Any of such incidents also could lead to significant claims against the Utility.Further, although the Utility o
ften enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities orthe construction or demol
ition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor’s work and can be subject to penalties orother enforcement a
ction if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.  The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or otherenforcement action 
as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions.Insurance, equipment 
warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery underall circumstances o
r against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject.  An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility’s insurance coverage may not b
e sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather events, ormay not be available at a reasonable cos
t, or available at all.The Utility has experienc
ed increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the Utility’s ordinary operations. PG&E Corporation, the Utility or its 
contractors and customers could continue to experience coverage reductions and/or increased wildfire insurance costs infuture years.  No assurance c
an be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of the Utility’s insurance coverage.  Uninsured losses and increases in the costof insurance may not be re
coverable in customer rates.  A loss that is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.As a result of the potentia
l application to investor-owned utilities of a strict liability standard under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, recent losses recorded byinsurance companies, the 
risk of increased wildfires including as a result of the ongoing drought, the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires,and the 2015 Butte fire, the Uti
lity may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future at a reasonable cost, or at all.  In addition, the Utility isunable to predict whether 
it would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses.If the amount of insuranc
e is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost or recover in rates the costs ofany uninsured losses, PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.41

The electric power industry is undergoing significant change driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy, which could materiallyaffect the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The electric power indust
ry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice (for example, customer-ownedgeneration and energy stor
age) and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy.  The electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of new energytechnologies that support Cal
ifornia's climate change and GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported by California policymakers. California's environment
al policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of the industry change.  For instance, SB 100, which was signed into law onSeptember 10, 2018, increases f
rom 50% to 60%, the percentage of California’s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030. SB 100 establishes afurther goal to have an e
lectric grid that is entirely powered by clean energy by 2045. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment by customersand third parties of DERs, such as on-si
te solar generation, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies.  These developmentswill require moderniz
ation of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity, increase the grid's capacity, andinterconnect DERs.
In order to enable the 
California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiencyprograms, energy storage opt
ions, EV infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g. rail and water projects).To this end, the CPUC is conducting proceedings to
: evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higherpenetration of DERs and, consider fu
ture grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by DERs,and if feasible, what, if 
any, compensation to utilities would be appropriate for enabling those investments; and clarify the role of the electric distribution gridoperator. The CPUC also authorized deve
lopment of two new, five-year programs aimed at accelerating widespread electric vehicle adoption and combatingclimate change. The new prog
rams will increase fast charging options for consumers as well as electric charging infrastructure for non-light-duty fleet vehicles.The industry change, costs associ
ated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility’sinability to successful
ly adapt to changes in the electric industry, could materially affect the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows.
A cyber incident, cyber security br
each, severe natural event or physical attack on the Utility’s operational networks and information technology systems couldhave a material effect on i
ts financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility’s electr
icity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communicationtechnologies, which can be dam
aged by natural events-such as severe weather or seismic events-and by malicious events, such as cyber and physical attacks. Private and public entit
ies, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and U.S. Government Departments, including the Departments of Defense,Homeland Security and Energy, and th
e White House, have noted that cyber-attacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, andfrequency.  The Utility’s ope
rational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure with newtechnologies and control syst
ems.  Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility’s operational networks could cause harm to the public or employees,significantly disrupt ope
rations, negatively impact the Utility’s ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas or otherwise operate in themost safe and effici
ent manner or at all, and damage the Utility’s assets or operations or those of third parties.The Utility also relies on 
complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information,including the Utility’s f
inancial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and theirdependents, contractors, and o
ther individuals. In addition, the Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, and toprovide other services to 
the Utility or the Utility’s customers. In addition, the Utility is increasingly being required to disclose large amounts of data (includingcustomer energy usage a
nd personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California’s electricity market related to grid modernization andcustomer choice. These th
ird-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility’s systems and information, or experiencesecurity incidents or in
adequate security measures. Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility’s information technology systems could impact the Utility’s ability totrack or collect revenues an
d to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting.42

The Utility and its third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to theUtility’s information 
technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility’s operations.  Noneof these breaches or at
tempts has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sfinancial condition, r
esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.  Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that theUtility will be able to pr
event the unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations.  Suchevents could subject the Uti
lity to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacylaws, investigations, and regul
atory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sreputation, any of which could hav
e a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility maintains cyb
er liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents.  However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance willcontinue to be availabl
e at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered byinsurance or recoverab
le in rates.The operation and decommissioning of the Utilit
y’s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able tofully recover its costs i
f regulatory requirements change or the plant ceases operations before the licenses expire.The operation of the 
Utility’s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such asrisks relating to the sto
rage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity,natural disaster, or t
errorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses couldhave a material e
ffect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the Utility may berequired under federa
l law to pay up to $275 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon facility butat any other nuclear power p
lant in the United States. On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirem
ent of Diablo Canyon units by 2024 and 2025. However, the Utility continues to face public concern aboutthe safety of nuclear g
eneration and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging theactions of the NRC and urging government
al entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail,regulatory proceedings m
ay take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changesin legislation, regula
tions, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility’s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease beforetheir respective l
icenses expire in 2024 and 2025. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecoveredinvestment and such charge 
could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows.
In addition, in order to re
tain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incurcosts in connection with (i) 
an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and developmentprogram, to facilit
ate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the Utility.  In its January 11, 2018decision, the CPUC authorized rate 
recovery up to $211.3 million and in its November 29, 2018 decision, the CPUC authorized rate recovery up to $352.1 millionas originally requested by 
the Utility for an employee retention program, but there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilledpersonnel under such program.
The Utility has incurred, and 
may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders.  (See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1.Business above.)  If the Utility we
re unable to recover these costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.  The Utilitymay determine that 
it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRCmay order the Utility to 
cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions.  The Utility may incur a material charge if itceases operations at Diab
lo Canyon’s two nuclear generation units before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. At December 31, 2018, the Utility’sunrecovered investment 
in Diablo Canyon was $1.7 billion.43

The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, atthe end of their useful l
ives.  (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - "Asset Retirement Obligations" of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatement in Item 8.)  Th
e CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioningcharges that are col
lected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit.  If theUtility’s actual deco
mmissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.For certain critical technologies, produc
ts and services, the Utility relies on a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, sole suppliers.  In the event thesesuppliers are unable to perform, the Utilit
y could experience delays and disruptions in its operations while it transitions to alternative plans or suppliers.The Utility relies on a l
imited number of sole source suppliers for certain of its technologies, products and services.  Although the Utility has long-term agreementswith such suppliers, if the suppli
ers are unable to deliver these technologies, products or services, the Utility could experience delays and disruptions while itimplements altern
ative plans and makes arrangements with acceptable substitute suppliers.  As a result, the Utility’s business, financial condition, and results ofoperations could be mate
rially affected.  As an example, the Utility relies on Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (recently acquired by Brookfield BusinessPartners L.P.) for its nuclea
r fuel assemblies, and Silver Spring Networks, Inc. and Aclara Technologies LLC as suppliers of proprietary SmartMeter™ devices andsoftware, and of mana
ged services, utilized in its advanced metering system that collects electric and natural gas usage data from customers.  If these suppliersencounter performanc
e difficulties or are unable to supply these devices or maintain and update their software, or provide other services to maintain these systems,the Utility’s meter
ing, billing, and electric network operations could be impacted and disrupted.44

Risks Related to Environmental FactorsSevere weather conditions, extended drought and shifting cli
mate patterns could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
Extreme weather, extend
ed drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with wildfire management in California. The Utility'sservice territory 
encompasses some of the most densely forested areas in California and, as a consequence, is subject to higher risk from vegetation-related ignitionevents than other Californ
ia IOUs. Further, environmental extremes, such as drought conditions followed by periods of wet weather, can driveadditional vegetation g
rowth (which can then fuel fires) and influence both the likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events.  In California, over the pastfive years, inconsistent 
and extreme precipitation, coupled with more hot days, have increased the wildfire risk and made wildfire outbreaks increasingly difficultto manage.  In particul
ar, the risk posed by wildfires has increased in the Utility’s service area as a result of an extended period of drought, bark beetle infestationsin the California fores
t and wildfire fuel increases due to record rainfall following the drought, and strong wind events, among other environmental factors.Contributing factors 
other than environmental can include local land use policies and historical forestry management practices.  The combined effects of extremeweather and climate 
change also impact this risk. For example, in 2017, there were nearly double the number of wildfires than the annual average, including five ofthe most devastating wildf
ires in California's history. On January 19, 2018, the CPUC approved a statewide fire-threat map that shows that approximately half ofthe Utility's service t
erritory is facing "elevated" or "extreme" fire danger. Approximately 25,000 circuit miles of the Utility's nearly 81,000 distribution overheadcircuit miles and app
roximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit miles are in such high-fire threat areas, significantly more in totalthan other California IOUs.
Severe weather events and oth
er natural disasters, including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, heat waves, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, risingsea levels, pandemics, sol
ar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters such as wildfires, could result in severe business disruptions, prolongedpower outages, property damage, 
injuries or loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to PG&E Corporationand the Utility.  Any such event could h
ave a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows.  Any of such events also could lead 
to significant claims against the Utility. Further, these events could result in regulatory penalties and disallowances,particularly if th
e Utility encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if the related losses are found to be the result of the Utility’spractices and/or the failure of
 electric and other equipment of the Utility.Further, the Utility has been s
tudying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on theUtility’s operations and is d
eveloping contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant.  Scientists project thatclimate change will increase electricity
 demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather.  As a result, the Utility’s hydroelectric generation could changeand the Utility would need to consid
er managing or acquiring additional generation.  If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources toreplace hydroelect
ric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. Inaddition, flooding caused by ris
ing sea levels could damage the Utility’s facilities, including gas, generation, and electric transmission and distribution assets.  TheUtility could incur substant
ial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries.  TheUtility anticipates 
that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery mayincrease.
Events or conditions caused by cl
imate change could have a greater impact on the Utility’s operations than the Utility’s studies suggest and could result in lowerrevenues or increased exp
enses, or both.  If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change,PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.45

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes in or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s financial results.
The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage,remediation of haza
rdous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and othercosts associated with compl
iance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required topay for environmental r
emediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although theUtility has recorded li
abilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination,remediation alternatives, the ap
plicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. (For more information, see Note 14 ofthe Notes to the Consolidated Financ
ial Statements in Item 8.)Environmental remedi
ation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and moreexpansive application of 
existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses orpermits issued by environmen
tal or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or othersanctions.
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to r
ecover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of thesemechanisms allows the Util
ity rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. TheCPUC may discontinue or change these ra
temaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC hasauthorized the Utility 
to recover in rates.Some of the Utility’s environ
mental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through ratesor insurance. (See “Environm
ental Regulation” in Item 1. and Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) The Utility’s costs toremediate groundwater 
contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue tohave, a material effect on P
G&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results. Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimatedcosts and by the extent to which a
ctual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities.State climate policy r
equires reductions in greenhouse gases of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050.  Various proposals for addressing these reductions have thepotential to reduce natural gas usage and increase natural gas costs. The future r
ecovery of the increased costs associated with compliance is uncertain.The CARB is the state’s primary regu
lator for GHG emission reduction programs.  Natural gas providers have been subject to compliance with CARB’s Cap-and-Trade Program since 2015, and natu
ral gas end-use customers have an increasing exposure to carbon costs under the Program through 2030 when the full cost willbe reflected in custo
mer bills. CARB’s Scoping Plan also proposes various methods of reducing GHG emissions from natural gas.  These include more aggressiveenergy efficiency prog
rams to reduce natural gas end use, increased renewable portfolio standards generation in the electric sector reducing noncore gas load, andreplacement of natural gas ap
pliances with electric appliances, leading to further reduced demand.  These natural gas load reductions may be partially offset byCARB’s proposals to deploy natural gas to rep
lace wood fuel in home heating and diesel in transportation applications.  CARB also proposes a displacement ofsome conventional natura
l gas with above-market renewable natural gas.  The combination of reduced load and increased costs could result in higher natural gascustomer bills and a p
otential mandate to deliver renewable natural gas could lead to cost recovery risk.Other Risk Factors
The Utility may be required to incur substantia
l costs in order to obtain or renew licenses and permits needed to operate the Utility’s business and the Utilitymay be subject to fines and penalties 
for failure to comply or obtain license renewal.The Utility must comply with th
e terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continuedoperation of the Utility
’s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many ofthe Utility’s capital investme
nt projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or othergovernmental permits. Th
ese permits, authorizations, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays. Further, existing permits andlicenses could be revoked or 
modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. Inaddition, the Utility oft
en seeks periodic renewal of a license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generationfacility.
46

If a license or permit is not renewed for a particular facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairmentcharge or other costs. Befor
e renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Utility’s compliance costs.In particular, in conne
ction with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility’s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new licenseconditions that could, among oth
er things, require increased expenditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility.In addition, local governm
ents may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has not beenpreviously required to obta
in. The Utility may incur pena
lties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect onPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply withnecessary governmental permit
s, authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated complianceand other costs in a time
ly manner, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materiallyaffected.
Poor investment performance or other fac
tors could require PG&E Corporation and the Utility to make significant unplanned contributions to its pensionplan, other postretirement benefits p
lans, and nuclear decommissioning trusts.PG&E Corporation and the Utility provid
e defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees. The Utility alsomaintains three trus
ts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities. The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the valueof plan assets and trust asse
ts. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts. The cost of providing pension andother postretirement benefits i
s also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return onplan assets, employee demog
raphics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future governmentregulation, and prior cont
ributions to the plans. Similarly, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trustassets, changes in the laws or r
egulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptions orforecasts related 
to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment. (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesof the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements in Item 8.) If the Utility is required to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension andpostretirement plans o
r if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover thecontributions or additiona
l costs in rates, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could bematerially affected.
The Utility’s success depends on the availab
ility of the services of a qualified workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreementswhich cover a substantial number of employees. PG&E Corporation’s and the Uti
lity’s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attract and retain qualifiedpersonnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disrupt
ions occur.The Utility’s workforce is ag
ing and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts torecruit and train new f
ield service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility’semployees are covered by 
collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renewthe terms of these agr
eements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-representedUtility employees could jo
in one of these unions in the future.PG&E Corporatio
n and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore thereputational harm gen
erated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings and the Chapter 11 Cases. Any such occurrences couldmaterially aff
ect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.47

The Utility’s business activities are concentrated in one region, as a result of which, its future performance may be affected by events and factors unique toCalifornia.
The Utility’s business activ
ities are concentrated in Northern California. As a result, the Utility’s future performance may be affected by events and economicfactors unique to Californ
ia or by regional regulation or legislation, for example the doctrine of inverse condemnation. (See “The doctrine of inversecondemnation, if applied by 
courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities fromsuch litigation and mat
erially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows” above.)ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Utility owns or has obtained the 
right to occupy and/or use real property comprising the Utility's electricity and natural gas distribution facilities, electricgeneration facilities, natural ga
s gathering facilities and generation facilities, and natural gas and electricity transmission facilities, which are described in Item 1.Business, under “Electric Uti
lity Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations.” The Utility occupies or uses real property that it does not own primarilythrough various leases, ease
ments, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental authorities. In total, the Utility occupies 11 millionsquare feet of real p
roperty, including 8 million square feet owned by the Utility. The Utility's corporate headquarters comprises approximately 1.7 million squarefeet located in seve
ral Utility-owned buildings in San Francisco, California.PG&E Corporation also leases approxi
mately 42,000 square feet of office space from a third party in San Francisco, California. This lease will expire in 2022. 
The Utility currently owns approx
imately 160,000, acres of land, including approximately 131,000 acres of watershed lands. In 2002 the Utility agreed toimplement its LCC to perman
ently preserve the six “beneficial public values” on all the watershed lands through conservation easements or equivalent protections,as well as to make approxim
ately 70,000 acres of the watershed lands available for donation to qualified organizations. The six “beneficial public values” beingpreserved by the LCC include: natu
ral habitat of fish, wildlife, and plants; open space; outdoor recreation by the general public; sustainable forestry; agriculturaluses; and historic values. The Ut
ility’s goal is to implement all the transactions needed to implement the LCC by the end of 2022, subject to securing all requiredregulatory approvals.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In addition to the following pro
ceedings, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course oftheir business.  For more infor
mation regarding material lawsuits and proceedings, see Item 7. MD&A, and Notes 13, 14, and 15 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8 . U.S. District Court Matters and Probation
On August 9, 2016, the jury in the federal 
criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in SanFrancisco, found the Utility gui
lty on one count of obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity managementregulations of the Natura
l Gas Pipeline Safety Act. On January 26, 2017, the court issued a judgment of conviction against the Utility. The court sentenced theUtility to a five-yea
r corporate probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination afterthree years, a fine of $
3 million to be paid to the federal government, certain advertising requirements, and community service.The probation includes a requ
irement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the probation, the Utilityhas retained a third-p
arty monitor at the Utility’s expense. The goal of the third-party monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriatesteps to maintain the safet
y of its gas and electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive programs on a Utility-widebasis.
48

On November 27, 2018, the court overseeing the Utility’s probation, issued an order requiring that the Utility, the United States Attorney’s Office for the NorthernDistrict of California 
(the “USAO”) and the third-party monitor provide written answers to a series of questions regarding the Utility’s compliance with the termsof its probation, including what 
requirements of the Utility’s probation “might be implicated were any wildfire started by reckless operation or maintenance ofPG&E power lines” or “might be imp
licated by any inaccurate, slow, or failed reporting of information about any wildfire by PG&E.” The court also ordered theUtility to provide “an ac
curate and complete statement of the role, if any, of PG&E in causing and reporting the recent 2018 Camp fire in Butte County and allother wildfires in Califo
rnia” since January 2017 (“Question 4 of the November 27 Order”). On December 5, 2018, the court issued an order requesting that theOffice of the Californi
a Attorney General advise the court of its view on “the extent to which, if at all, the reckless operation or maintenance of PG&E power lineswould constitute a crime und
er California law.” The responses of the Attorney General were submitted on December 28, 2018, and the responses of the Utility, theUSAO and the third-party monitor were sub
mitted on December 31, 2018.On January 3, 2019, the court issued a new orde
r requiring that the Utility provide further information regarding the Atlas fire.  the court noted that “[t]his orderpostpones the question of the adequ
acy of PG&E’s response” to Question 4 of the November 27 Order.  On January 4, 2019, the court issued another orderrequiring that the Util
ity provide “with respect to each of the eighteen October 2017 Northern California wildfires that [Cal Fire] has attributed to [the Utility’s]facilities,” info
rmation regarding the wind conditions in the vicinity of each fire’s origin and information about the equipment allegedly involved in each fire’signition.  The responses of the Uti
lity were submitted on January 10, 2019.On January 9, 2019, the court ordered th
e Utility to appear in court on January 30, 2019, as a result of the court’s finding that “there is probable cause to believethere has been a violat
ion of the conditions of supervision” with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire.  In addition, on January 9, 2019,the court issued an order (
the “January 9 Order”) proposing to add new conditions of probation that would require the Utility, among other things, to:•
prior to June 21, 2019, “re-inspect all of its electrical grid and remove or trim all trees that could fall onto its power lines, poles or equipment in high-windconditions, . . . identify and fix 
all conductors that might swing together and arc due to slack and/or other circumstances under high-wind conditions[,]identify and fix damaged o
r weakened poles, transformers, fuses and other connectors [and] identify and fix any other condition anywhere in its gridsimilar to any condition 
that contributed to any previous wildfires”,•
“document the foregoing inspections and the work done and . . . rate each segment’s safety under various wind conditions” and•
at all times from and after June 21, 2019, “supply electricity only through those parts of its electrical grid it has determined to be safe under the windconditions then prevailing.”
The Utility was ordered to show cause by J
anuary 23, 2019 as to why the Utility’s conditions of probation should not be modified as proposed.  The Utility'sresponse was submitted on January 23, 2019. The 
court requested that Cal Fire file a public statement, and invited the CPUC to comment, by January 25, 2019.  OnJanuary 30, 2019, the court found that 
the Utility had violated a condition of its probation with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire.The court issued an order sta
ting that a sentencing hearing on the probation violation will be set at a later date. Also on January 30, 2019, the court ordered theUtility to submit to the cou
rt on February 6, 2019 the 2019 Wildfire Safety Plan that the Utility was required to submit to the CPUC by February 6, 2019 inaccordance with SB 901, and invited in
terested parties to comment on such plan by February 20, 2019. In addition, on February 14, 2019, the court ordered theUtility to provide addition
al information, including on its vegetation clearance requirements. The Utility submitted its response to the court on February 22, 2019.As of February 24, 2019, to the Utility’s knowledg
e, no parties have submitted comments to the court on the 2019 Wildfire Safety Plan.49

Order Instituting an Investigation into the Utility’s Safety CultureOn August 27, 2015, the CPUC began a formal investigation 
into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utilityprioritize safety 
and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards. The CPUC directed the SED to evaluate theUtility’s and PG&E Corporation’s organ
izational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to the Utility’s record ofoperations, including its r
ecord of safety incidents. The SED engaged a consultant to assist in the SED’s investigation and the preparation of a report containing theSED’s assessment, and subsequently, to repo
rt on the implementation by the Utility of the consultant's recommendations.On May 8, 2017, the CPUC released the consultant’s 
report, accompanied by a scoping memo and ruling. The scoping memo established a second phase in the OIIin which the CPUC evaluated the safety 
recommendations of the consultant. Phase two of the proceeding also considered all necessary measures, including, but notlimited to, a potenti
al reduction of the Utility’s return on equity. On November 17, 2017, the CPUC issued a phase two scoping memo and procedural schedule.The scoping memo directed 
the Utility to file testimony addressing a number of issues including: adoption of the safety recommendations from the consultant, theUtility’s implement
ation process for the safety recommendations of the consultant, the Utility’s Board of Director’s actions and initiatives related to safety cultureand the consultant’s reco
mmendations, the Utility’s corrective action program, and the Utility’s response to certain specified safety incidents that occurred in 2013through 2015.
The Utility’s testimony was subm
itted to the CPUC on January 8, 2018 and stated that the Utility agrees with all the recommendations of the consultant andsupports their adoption by the CPUC. Other part
ies’ responsive testimony was submitted on February 16, 2018, followed by the Utility’s rebuttal testimony onFebruary 23, 2018.
On November 29, 2018, the CPUC approved the PD in connection with this p
roceeding. The decision directed the Utility to implement the recommendations setforth in the May 2017 consultant 
report no later than July 1, 2019, and to submit quarterly reports on the Utility's implementation status beginning in the fourthquarter of 2018.
On December 21, 2018, the CPUC issued a Scoping Memo and Ruling (th
e “Scoping Memo”) setting forth the scope to be addressed in the next phase of itsongoing investigation into whethe
r the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utility prioritize safety and adequately directsresources to promote ac
countability and achieve safety goals and standards (the “Safety Culture OII”). The Scoping Memo provides that the CPUC “will examine[PG&E’s] current corporat
e governance, structure, and operations to determine if the utility is positioned to provide safe electrical and gas service, and will reviewalternatives to the current mana
gement and operational structures of providing electric and gas service in Northern California.”In the Scoping Memo, the CPUC alleges that 
the Utility has had “serious safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years” and despitepenalties and other re
medial measures in connection with these problems, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have failed to develop “a comprehensive enterprise-wide approach to addressing saf
ety.” The Scoping Memo outlines a number of proposals to address the CPUC’s concerns regarding PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s safety cultu
re, including, but not limited to, (i) replacement of all or part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s existing boards of directors andcorporate management, (ii) separati
ng the Utility’s gas and electric distribution and transmission businesses into separate companies, (iii) reorganizing the Utilityinto regional subsidiari
es based on regional distinctions, (iv) reconstituting the Utility as a publicly owned utility or utilities, (v) providing for entities other thanthe Utility to provide gene
ration services and (vi) conditioning the Utility’s return on equity on safety performance. The Scoping Memo does not propose penaltiesand states that this phase 
“is not a punitive phase.” The Utility submitted its background filing to the CPUC on January 16, 2019 and opening comments were filedon February 13, 2019. Reply comments are du
e on February 28, 2019.PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e unable to predict whether additional fines, penalties, or other ratemaking tools such as a potential reduction of the Utility'sreturn on equity will be adopt
ed by the CPUC in future phases of this proceeding.50

Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power PlantThe Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant e
mploys a “once-through” cooling water system that is regulated under a Clean Water Act permit issued by the CentralCoast Board. This permit allows the Di
ablo Canyon power plant to discharge the cooling water at a temperature no more than 22 degrees above the temperature ofthe ambient receiv
ing water, and requires that the beneficial uses of the water be protected.  The beneficial uses of water in this region include industrial watersupply, marine and wildlife h
abitat, shellfish harvesting, and preservation of rare and endangered species.  In January 2000, the Central Coast Board issued aproposed draft cease and des
ist order alleging that, although the temperature limit has never been exceeded, the Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant's dischargewas not protective of benef
icial uses.In October 2000, the Utility and th
e Central Coast Board reached a tentative settlement under which the Central Coast Board agreed to find that the Utility'sdischarge of cooling water 
from the Diablo Canyon power plant protects beneficial uses and that the intake technology reflects the best technology available, asdefined in the federa
l Clean Water Act.  As part of the tentative settlement, the Utility agreed to take measures to preserve certain acreage north of the plant and tofund approximately $6 mil
lion in environmental projects and future environmental monitoring related to coastal resources.  On March 21, 2003, the Central CoastBoard voted to accept the se
ttlement agreement.  On June 17, 2003, the settlement agreement was executed by the Utility, the Central Coast Board and theCalifornia Attorney Genera
l's Office.  A condition to the effectiveness of the settlement agreement was that the Central Coast Board renew Diablo Canyon'spermit.
However, at its July 10, 2003 meeting, th
e Central Coast Board did not renew the permit and continued the permit renewal hearing indefinitely.  Several CentralCoast Board members indicat
ed that they no longer supported the settlement agreement, and the Central Coast Board requested a team of independent scientists todevelop additional infor
mation on possible mitigation measures for Central Coast Board staff.  In 2005, the Central Coast Board reviewed the scientists' draftreport recommending sev
eral such mitigation measures, but no action was taken.In 2010, the California Wat
er Board adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other significantmeasures to reduce the impact
 on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%. The policy also provided for an alternativecompliance approach for n
uclear plants if certain criteria were met. As required by the policy, the California Water Board appointed a committee to evaluate thefeasibility and cost of us
ing alternative technologies to achieve compliance at Diablo Canyon. The committee’s consultant submitted its final report to theCalifornia Water Board 
in September 2014. The report addressed feasibility, costs and timeframes to install alternative technologies at Diablo Canyon, such ascooling towers.
On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirem
ent of Diablo Canyon Unit 1 by 2024 and Unit 2 by 2025. As a result of the planned retirement, the CaliforniaWater Board will no longer ne
ed to address alternative compliance measures for Diablo Canyon. As required under the policy, starting in 2017, the Utility pays anannual interim mit
igation fee, which it will continue to pay until operations cease in 2025. Additionally, the Utility expects that its decision to retire Diablo Canyonwill affect the te
rms of a final settlement agreement between the Utility and the Central Coast Board regarding the thermal component of the plant’s once-throughcooling discharge.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility bel
ieve that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material effect on the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows.ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY

ITEM 7. MANAGE
MENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOVERVIEW
PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose pri
mary operating subsidiary is the Utility, a public utility serving northern and central California.  The Utilitygenerates revenues ma
inly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.The Utility’s base revenue 
requirements are set by the CPUC in its GRC and GT&S rate case and by the FERC in its TO rate cases based on forecastcosts.  Differences between 
forecast costs and actual costs can occur for numerous reasons, including the volume of work required and the impact of market forceson the cost of labor and mat
erials.  Differences in costs can also arise from changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level.  Generally,differences between a
ctual costs and forecast costs affect the Utility’s ability to earn its authorized return (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that ImpactedEarnings” in Results of Operations b
elow).  However, for certain operating costs, such as costs associated with pension benefits, the Utility is authorized to trackthe difference betwe
en actual amounts and forecast amounts and recover or refund the difference through rates (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that didnot Impact Earnings” in Resul
ts of Operations below).  The Utility also collects revenue requirements to recover certain costs that the CPUC has authorized theUtility to pass on to customers, su
ch as the costs to procure electricity or natural gas for its customers.  Therefore, although these costs can fluctuate, they generallydo not impact net income 
(referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Results of Operations below).   See “RatemakingMechanisms” in Item 1. Business 
for further discussion.55

This is a combined report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and includes separate Consolidated Financial Statements for each of these two entities.  Thiscombined MD&A should be read in conjunc
tion with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included inItem 8. 
Chapter 11 Proceedings
On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. PG&E Corporation's and theUtility’s Chapter 11 Cases are b
eing jointly administered under the caption In re: PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Case No. 19-30088(DM).
PG&E Corporation and the Utility cont
inue to operate their businesses as debtors in possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordancewith applicable provisions of 
the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. As debtors in possession, PG&E Corporation and the Utility areauthorized to continue to op
erate as ongoing businesses, and may pay all debts and honor all obligations arising in the ordinary course of their businesses after thePetition Date. However, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility may not pay third-party claims or creditors on account of obligations arising before the Petition Date orengage in transactions outs
ide the ordinary course of business without approval of the Bankruptcy Court.Under the Bankruptcy Code, third-par
ty actions to collect pre-petition indebtedness owed by PG&E Corporation or the Utility, as well as most litigation pendingagainst PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity (including the third-party matters described under Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8), are subject to an auto
matic stay. Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court providing otherwise, substantially all pre-petition liabilities will be administeredunder a Chapter 11 plan of reorg
anization to be voted upon by creditors and other stakeholders, and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. However, under theBankruptcy Code, regulatory or cr
iminal proceedings are generally not subject to an automatic stay, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect theseproceedings to continue during 
the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.To assure ordinary course oper
ations, on January 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility received interim approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of“first day” motions, inc
luding motions that authorize them to maintain their existing cash management system, to continue wage and salary payments and otherbenefits to their emp
loyees, to secure debtor in possession financing and other customary relief. On February 27, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility receivedfinal approval of the f
irst day motion to continue wage and salary payments and other benefits to their employees (with one limited objection with respect to adiscrete matter h
aving been preserved by the Bankruptcy Court) and certain other first day motions for customary relief. Hearings on certain other first daymotions, including a hearing 
to consider final approval of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s motions to continue their existing cash management system and toapprove their debtor in possess
ion financing, have not been held and no assurances can be given that the Bankruptcy Court will approve such motions on a finalbasis. PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
are unable to predict the date of the final hearing with respect to such motions, but there are hearings currently scheduledfor March 12, March 13 and March 27, 2019.
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cas
es, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into the DIP Credit Agreement, among the Utility, as borrower, PG&ECorporation, as guarantor, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as ad
ministrative agent, Citibank, N.A., as collateral agent, and the DIP Lenders. The DIP CreditAgreement provides for $5.5 bil
lion in the form of (i) the DIP Revolving Facility in an aggregate amount of $3.5 billion, including a $1.5 billion letter of creditsubfacility, (ii) th
e DIP Initial Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion and (iii) the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility in anaggregate principal 
amount of $500 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. As a result of the Bankruptcy Court’s interim approval of the DIPCredit Agreement on January 31, 2019, and 
the satisfaction of the other conditions thereof, the DIP Credit Agreement became effective on February 1, 2019, and aportion of the DIP Revolving Facility 
in the amount of $1.5 billion (including $750 million of the letter of credit subfacility) was made available to PG&ECorporation and the Utility. As of Febru
ary 28, 2019, the remainder of the DIP Revolving Facility (including the remainder of the $1.5 billion letter of creditsubfacility), the DIP Init
ial Term Loan Facility and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility are unavailable for borrowing and will remain unavailable until andunless the Bankruptcy Court approves th
e availability thereof following a final hearing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the date of the finalhearing, but it is curren
tly scheduled for March 13, 2019. There can be no assurances that the Bankruptcy Court will grant final approval of the DIP Facilities at thefinal hearing, or at all.

Borrowings under the DIP Credit Agreement are senior secured obligations of the Utility, secured by substantially all of the Utility’s assets and entitled tosuperpriority administ
rative expense claim status in the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case. The Utility’s obligations under the DIP Credit Agreement are guaranteed byPG&E Corporation, and such guarantee is 
a senior secured obligation of PG&E Corporation, secured by substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s assets andentitled to superprior
ity administrative expense claim status in PG&E Corporation’s Chapter 11 Case. The DIP Credit Agreement will mature on December 31,2020, subject to the Utility’s op
tion to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain terms and conditions are satisfied, including the payment of anextension fee. The Utility p
aid customary fees and expenses in connection with obtaining the DIP Credit Agreement.The commencement of the 
Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default or termination event, and caused an automatic and immediate acceleration of the debtoutstanding under or in respec
t of certain instruments and agreements relating to direct financial obligations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility (the “AcceleratedDirect Financial Obligat
ions”). Accordingly, as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the principal amount of the Accelerated Direct FinancialObligations, together with ac
crued interest thereon, and in case of certain indebtedness, premium, if any, thereon, immediately became due and payable. However,any efforts to enforce su
ch payment obligations are automatically stayed as of the Petition Date, and are subject to the applicable provisions of the BankruptcyCode and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The 
material Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations include the outstanding senior notes, agreements in respect ofcertain series of pol
lution control bonds, and PG&E Corporation's term loan facility, as well as short-term borrowings under PG&E Corporation's and the Utility'srevolving credit fac
ilities and the Utility's term loan facility disclosed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The filing of theChapter 11 Cases may also provide th
e counterparties under certain commodity and related agreements with the right to declare an event of default and to seektermination of such agr
eements, with such rights subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. (For moreinformation, see "Liquidi
ty and Financial Resources - Financial Resources - Acceleration of Pre-petition Debt Obligations" in Item 7. MD&A.)Under the priority scheme 
established by the Bankruptcy Code, certain post-petition and secured or “priority” pre-petition liabilities need to be satisfied beforegeneral unsecured cred
itors and holders of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s equity are entitled to receive any distribution. No assurance can be given as towhat values, if any, will be asc
ribed in the Chapter 11 Cases to the claims and interests of each of these constituencies. Additionally, no assurance can be given asto whether, when or in what form unsecu
red creditors and holders of PG&E Corporation's or the Utility’s equity may receive a distribution on such claims orinterests.
Under the Bankruptcy Code, PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases,including, without limita
tion, leases of real property and equipment, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and to certain other conditions. Anydescription of an executo
ry contract or unexpired lease in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, where applicable, the express termination rights thereunderor a quantification of 
their obligations, must be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by, any overriding rejection rights PG&E Corporation and the Utility haveunder the Bankruptcy Code.
For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cas
es, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business is subject to the risks and uncertainties of bankruptcy. For example, theChapter 11 Cases could adversely a
ffect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s relationships with suppliers and employees which, in turn, could adversely affectthe value of PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s business and assets. At this time, it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact of the Chapter 11 Caseson PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s bus
iness or various creditors, or whether or when PG&E Corporation and the Utility will emerge from bankruptcy.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
future results depend upon the confirmation, and successful implementation, on a timely basis, of a Chapter 11 plan ofreorganization. For a discuss
ion of the significant risks and uncertainties related to the Chapter 11 Cases, see “Risks Related to Chapter 11 Proceedings andLiquidity” in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Going Concern
The accompanying Consolidated Finan
cial Statements to this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates thecontinuity of operations, th
e realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, PG&E Corporation and the Utility arefacing extraordinary 
challenges relating to a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in Northern California in 2017 and 2018. As a result of these challenges,such realization of ass
ets and satisfaction of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. For more information about the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern Californiawildfires, see Item 3. Leg
al Proceedings, Item 7. MD&A, and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.57

Management has concluded that uncertainty regarding these matters raises substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue asgoing concerns, and their indep
endent registered public accountants have included an explanatory paragraph in their auditors’ report which states certain conditionsexist which raise substanti
al doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as going concerns in relation to the foregoing. The ConsolidatedFinancial Statements do not 
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. For more information about these matters, see Note 1of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements and “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in Item 8.Summary of Changes in Net Income and Earnings per Share
PG&E Corporation’s net losses avail
able for common shareholders were $6.9 billion in 2018, compared to net incom e available for common shareholders of $1.6 billion 
in 2017. In 2018, PG&E Corporation recognized ch arges of $14 billion (pre-tax), offset by pro bable insurance recoveries of $2.2 billion (pre-tax), associated with third-pa
rty claims and legal and other costs related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.Key Factors Affecting Financial Results
PG&E Corporation and the Utility bel
ieve that their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the followingfactors:
•
The
Outcome
of
the
Chapter
11
Cases.
For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cas es, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business is subject to the risks anduncertainties of bankrup
tcy. For example, the Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect the Utility’s relationships with suppliers and employees which, inturn, could adversely aff
ect the value of the business and assets of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also expect toincur increased lega
l and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and the reorganization. At this time, it is not possible to predictwith certainty the ef
fect of the Chapter 11 Cases on their business or various creditors, or whether or when PG&E Corporation and the Utility will emergefrom bankruptcy. PG&E Corporation’s and 
the Utility’s future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows depend upon confirming,and successfully implem
enting, on a timely basis, a plan of reorganization.•
The
Utility’s
Ability
to
Fund
Ongoing
Operations
and
Other
Capital
Needs.
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cas es, PG&E Corporation and the Utilityentered into the DIP Credit Agre
ement, and a portion of the DIP Revolving Facility in the amount of $1.5 billion (including $750 million of the letter ofcredit subfacility
) was made available. The remainder of the DIP Facilities are unavailable for borrowing and will remain unavailable until and unless theBankruptcy Court approves the avai
lability thereof following a final hearing.  For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utilityexpect that the DIP Credit Agre
ement, together with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and distributions received from subsidiaries, will be theUtility’s primary sourc
e of capital to fund ongoing operations and other capital needs and that they will have limited, if any, access to additionalfinancing. In the event th
at cash on hand, cash flow from operations, distributions received from subsidiaries, and availability under the DIP CreditAgreement are not suffi
cient to meet these liquidity needs, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be required to seek additional financing, and canprovide no assurance that add
itional financing would be available or, if available, offered on acceptable terms.  The amount of any such additionalfinancing could be limi
ted by negative covenants in the DIP Credit Agreement, which include restrictions on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's abilityto, among other things, incur add
itional indebtedness and create liens on assets.58

•The
Impact
of
Wildfires.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility fa ce several uncertainties in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires, r
elated to: the amount of possible loss related to third-party claims (in 2018, the Utility recorded total charges of $13.4 billion, whichreflects the low end of th
e range of reasonably estimated losses and is subject to change based on additional information), which aggregate possiblelosses, if the Utility were 
found liable for certain or all of the costs, expenses and other losses in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires (o
ther than potential punitive damages, fines and penalties or damages related to future claims), could exceed $30 billion; punitivedamages, which could be mate
rial; fines or penalties, which could be material, if the CPUC or any law enforcement agency brought an enforcementaction and determined 
that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations; the amount of damages in respect of future claims, whichcould be material; 
the applicability of the doctrine of inverse condemnation in the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires litigation,which the Utility intends to con
tinue to challenge during the pendency of its Chapter 11 Case; the applicability of other theories of liability, includingnegligence, related 
to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfire claims; the recoverability of the above mentioned costs, even if a courtdecision imposes liabil
ity under the doctrine of inverse condemnation; the amount of the Customer Harm Threshold under SB 901 and the timing of anyrecovery by the Utility in 
excess of the Customer Harm Threshold in a proceeding before the CPUC; and recoverability of clean-up and repair costs (theUtility incurred costs of $681 
million for clean-up and repair of the Utility’s facilities through December 31, 2018). (See Notes 3 and 13 of the Notes tothe Consolidated Financial Sta
tements in Item 8 and Item 1A. Risk Factors.)•
The
Outcome
of
Other
Enforcement,
Litigation,
and
Regulatory
Matters
. The Utility’s financia l results may continue to be impacted by the outcome ofother current and futur
e enforcement, litigation (to the extent not stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases), and regulatory matters, including theoutcome of the Locate and M
ark OII, phase two of the Safety Culture OII, the outcome of phase two of the ex parte OII, the sentencing terms of theUtility’s January 27, 2017 feder
al criminal conviction, including the oversight of the Utility’s probation and the potential recommendations by the third-party monitor, and potenti
al penalties in connection with the Utility’s safety and other self-reports. (See Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8.)•
The
Timing
and
Outcome
of
Ratemaking
Proceedings
. The Utility’s financia l results may be impacted by the timing and outcome of its 2019 GT&S ratecase, 2020 GRC, FERC TO18, TO19, and TO20 rate cases, future cost of capi
tal proceedings, and its ability to timely recover costs not in rates alreadyincurred and to be incurr
ed in the future, including those tracked in its CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA and the Utility's 2019 Wildfire Safety Plan. The outcomeof regulatory proceeding
s can be affected by many factors, including intervening parties’ testimonies, potential rate impacts, the Utility’s reputation, theregulatory and politic
al environments, and other factors. (See Notes 3 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and“Regulatory Matters” be
low.)•
The
Utility’s
Compliance
with
the
CPUC
Capital
Structure
. The CPUC’s capital structure dec isions require the Utility to maintain a 52% equity ratio onaverage over the period t
hat the authorized capital structure is in place, and to file an application for a waiver to the capital structure condition if anadverse financial ev
ent reduces its equity ratio by 1% or more. The CPUC’s decisions state that the Utility shall not be considered in violation of theseconditions during the period th
e waiver application is pending resolution. Due to the net charges recorded in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and the2017 Northern California wildfi
res as of December 31, 2018, the Utility intends to submit to the CPUC an application for a waiver of the capital structurecondition on February 28, 2019. The waiver is sub
ject to CPUC approval. The Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of its waiverapplication.

the risks that could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows, or that could cause futu
re results to differ from historical results, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the 2018 Form 10-K.  In addition, this 2018 Form 10-Kcontains forward-looking sta

The table below shows certain i
tems from the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Income for 2018, 2017, and 2016.  The table separately identifies the revenuesand costs that impacted 
earnings from those that did not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is authorized to pass through directly to customers (suchas costs to purchase elec
tricity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose programs) and the corresponding amount of revenues collected to recoverthose pass-through costs, do not impa
ct earnings.  In addition, expenses that have been specifically authorized (such as energy procurement costs) and thecorresponding revenues the Uti
lity is authorized to collect to recover such costs, do not impact earnings.60

Revenues that impact earnings are primarily those that have been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility’s costs to own and operate its assetsand to provide the Utility an oppo
rtunity to earn its authorized rate of return on rate base.  Expenses that impact earnings are primarily those that the Utility incursto own and operate its assets.

The following discussion presents th
e Utility’s operating results for 2018, 2017, and 2016, focusing on revenues and expenses that impacted earnings for theseperiods.
Operating Revenues
The Utility’s electr
ic and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $39 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primar ily due to increased baserevenues authorized in th
e 2017 GRC, partially offset by tax benefits resulting from the Tax Act expected to be returned to customers. See "Regulatory Matters"below.  
The Utility’s electr
ic and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $144 million , or 1% , in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higherelectric transmission revenues.
61

Operating and MaintenanceThe Utility’s operating and 
maintenance expenses that impacted earnings increased $363 million , or 7% , in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to $209 millionfor clean up and repair 
costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, as compared to $17 million relating to the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires ch
arged in 2017. Also, the Utility recorded charges of $187 million in additional legal and o ther costs relating to the 2017 Northern Californiawildfires and the 2018 Camp fir
e (the Utility recorded $205 million for legal and other costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Campfire in 2018, as compared to $18 
million in 2017). The Utility also recorded charges of $121 million reflecting the additional write off of insurance premiums forsingle event coverage pol
icies (the Utility recorded $185 million in 2018 for the write off of insurance premiums, as compared to $64 million in 2017). Theseincreases were partially offset
 by a $38 million reduction to the estimated disallowance for gas-related capital costs that were expected to exceed authorizedamounts in 2018, compared to a $47 m
illion disallowance recorded in 2017 related to the Diablo Canyon settlement. Additionally, the increases were offset by adecrease in legal and o
ther costs relating to the 2015 Butte fire of $20 million in 2018 compared to 2017 (the Utility recorded $40 million for legal and other costsrelating to the 2015 Butte f
ire in 2018 as compared to $60 million in 2017).The Utility’s operating and 
maintenance expenses that impacted earnings decreased $550 million, or 10%, in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2017, the Utility incurred$455 million less in disallowed 
charges (the Utility recorded a $47 million disallowance related to the Diablo Canyon settlement in 2017 as compared to $502million of disallowed cap
ital charges related to the San Bruno Penalty Decision and 2015 GT&S rate case decision in 2016). This decrease was partially offset by a$64 million write off of insu
rance premiums for single event coverage policies recorded in 2017, with no corresponding activity in 2016. Additionally, the decreasewas offset by a $51 million inc
rease in legal and other costs (the Utility recorded $18 million relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and $60 millionrelating to the 2015 Butte f
ire in 2017, as compared to $27 million relating to the 2015 Butte fire in 2016).Wildfire-related cla
ims, net of insurance recoveriesCosts related to wildfires 
that impacted earnings increased by $ 11.8 billion in 2018 compared to 2017. In 2018, the Utility recognized charges of $ 14 billion,offset by probable insuranc
e recoveries of $ 2.2 billion associated with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. In 2017, the Utility recognizeda charge of $350 million, of
fset by probable insurance recoveries of $350 million related to the 2015 Butte fire.In 2016, the Utility recogniz
ed a $750 million charge, offset by probable insurance recoveries of $625 million related to the 2015 Butte fire.Depreciation, Amortization, and Decommissioning
The Utility’s deprecia
tion, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased by $182 million , or 6% , in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to capitaladditions. In 2017, the Utility's dep
reciation, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased by $100 million, or 4%, compared to 2016, primarily due tothe impact of capit
al additions and higher depreciation rates as authorized by the CPUC in the 2017 GRC.Interest Income
The Utility's interest in
come increased by $ 44 million, or 147% , in 2018 as compared to 2017, prima rily due to higher interest rates affecting various regulatorybalancing accounts and flu
ctuations in those accounts. There was no material change in the Utility's interest income in 2017 as compared to 2016. The Utility'sinterest income is pr
imarily affected by changes in regulatory balancing accounts and changes in interest rates. 
Interest Expense
The Utility’s interest 
expense increased by $37 million , or 4% , in 2018 compared to 2017. The Utility’s interest expenses increased by $58 million, or 7%, in2017 compared to 2016, primari
ly due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.Other Income, Net
The Utility's other income, n
et increased by $ 39 million, or 60% , in 2018 as compared to 2017, prima rily due to an increase in AFUDC as the average balance ofconstruction work in progress was highe
r in 2018 as compared to 2017. There was no material change in the Utility's other income, net in 2017 as compared to2016.
62

Income Tax ProvisionThe Utility’s income tax p
rovision decreased $3.7 billion in 2018 compared to 2017.  The decre ase in the income tax provision and increase in the effective tax ratewere primarily the r
esult of pre-tax losses in 2018 versus pre-tax income in 2017, partially offset by a decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%as a result of the Tax Act.
The Utility’s income tax p
rovision increased $357 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in the tax provision was primarily the result of the statutory taxeffect of higher pre
-tax income in 2017 compared to 2016 and an adjustment required to record the change in deferred tax balances due to tax reform in 2017 withno comparable adjustmen
t in 2016.The following table reconc

Includes the effect of federal flow-through ratemaking treatment for certain property-related costs as authorized by the 2014 GRC decision (impacting the twelve months ended December 31,2017), the 2017 GRC decision (impacting the twelve months ended December 31, 2018), and by the 2015 GT&S decision which i
mpacted all periods presented.  All amounts are impacted bythe level of income before income taxes.  The 2014 GRC, 2017 GRC, and 2015 GT&S rate case decisions authorized revenue requirements that reflect flow-through ratemaking for temporary
income tax differences attributable to repair costs and certain other property-related costs for federal tax purposes.  For these temporary tax differences, PG&E Corporation and the Utility
recognize the deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities.  Therefore, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s effective tax rates are i
mpactedas these differences arise and reverse.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probable tha
t these amounts will be recoveredfrom or returned to customers in future rates.  In 2018, the amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess deferred tax benefits to be refunded to customers as a result of the Tax
Act passed in December 2017.

These amounts primarily represent the impact of tax audit settlements.Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings
Fluctuations in revenues tha
t did not impact earnings are primarily driven by procurement costs. See below for more information.63

Cost of ElectricityThe Utility’s cost of ele
ctricity includes the cost of power purchased from third parties (including renewable energy resources), transmission, fuel used in its owngeneration facili
ties, fuel supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade program, and realized gainsand losses on price risk manag
ement activities.  (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The Utility’s total purchased poweris driven by customer demand, 
the availability of the Utility’s own generation facilities (including Diablo Canyon and its hydroelectric plants), and the cost-effectiveness of each source
 of electricity.(in millions)

     (1) Average cost of purchased power was impacted primarily by lower Utility electric customer demand, driven by customer departures to CCAs or direct access providers, and a largerpercentage of higher cost renewable energy resources being allocated to the fewer remaining Utility electric customers. See further discussion in “Legislat
ive and Regulatory Initiatives -Power Charge Indifference Adjustment,” below.

The decrease in purchased power for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower Utility electric customer demand. Cost of Natural Gas
The Utility’s cost of natur
al gas includes the costs of procurement, storage and transportation of natural gas, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-tradeprogram, and realized g
ains and losses on price risk management activities.  (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  TheUtility’s cost of natura

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCESOverview
On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. In connection with theChapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity entered into a DIP Credit Agreement. On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a motionseeking, among other things, int
erim and final approval of the DIP Facilities. On January 31, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court provided interim approval of the DIPFacilities and on February 1, 2019, th
e DIP Credit Agreement was executed and became effective and a portion of the DIP Revolving Facility in the amount of$1.5 
billion (including $750 million of the lett er of credit subfacility) was made available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility. As of February 28, 2019, theremainder of the DIP Revolving Fac
ility (including the remainder of the $1.5 billion letter of c redit subfacility), the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIPDelayed Draw Term Loan Facility 
are unavailable for borrowing and will remain unavailable until and unless the Bankruptcy Court approves the availabilitythereof following a fina
l hearing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the date of the final hearing, but it is currently scheduled for March 13,2019. There can be no assurances th
at the Bankruptcy Court will grant final approval of the DIP Facilities at the final hearing, or at all. (For more information onthe DIP Credit Agreement, see "DIP Credi
t Agreement" below and Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cas
es, the Utility’s ability to fund operations, finance capital expenditures and pay other ongoing expenses and makedistributions to PG&E Corporation will p
rimarily depend on the levels of its operating cash flows and availability under the DIP Credit Agreement. The Utilityexpects that the DIP Facili
ties will provide it with sufficient liquidity to fund its ongoing operations, including its ability to provide safe service to customers,during the Chapter 11 Cases. For the dura
tion of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation's ability to fund operations and pay other ongoing expenses willprimarily depend on cash on hand 
and intercompany transfers. In the event that PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's capital needs increase materially due tounexpected events or trans
actions, additional financing outside of the DIP Facilities may be required, which would be subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court.Such approval is not assured. For more 
information on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's material commitments for capital expenditures, see "RegulatoryMatters" below.
During 2018 and January 2019, PG&E Corporation's and the Uti
lity's credit ratings were subject to multiple downgrades by Fitch, S&P and Moody's including toratings below investment gr
ade and ultimately to “D” or low “C” ratings. Effective February 5, 2019, Moody's has withdrawn each of its credit ratings for PG&ECorporation and the Utility as 
a result of the Chapter 11 Cases. As a result of PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's credit ratings ceasing to be rated at investmentgrade, the Utility has been 
required to post additional collateral under its commodity purchase agreements, and other obligations, and has been exposed tosignificant constrain
ts on its customary trade credit. In addition, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be required to post additional collateral in respect ofcertain other obliga
tions, including workers' compensation and environmental remediation obligations. (See Notes 9 and 14 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8.)Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist o
f cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  PG&E Corporation and theUtility maintain sepa
rate bank accounts and primarily invest their cash in money market funds.As of December 31, 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity had unconsolidated cash and cash equivalent balances of $373 million and $ 1.3 billion, respectively.On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility had unconsolidated cash and cash equivalent balances of $370 million and $490 million (includingapproximately $250 mill
ion of customer deposits and cash held from counterparties by the Utility), respectively. Starting in early January 2019, the Utility's cashand cash equivalent balan
ce decreased by approximately $811 million to satisfy collateral posting needs, address accelerated payment and pre-pay demands ofenergy commodity suppliers, 
and to address requests from other essential suppliers for shortened payment terms or elimination of credit lines. As of February 27,2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had unconso
lidated cash and cash equivalent balances of approximately $480 million and $1.7 billion, respectively.65

Financial ResourcesAcceleration of Pre-petit
ion Debt ObligationsThe commencement of the 
Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default or termination event, and caused an automatic and immediate acceleration of theAccelerated Direct Fin
ancial Obligations. Accordingly, as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the principal amount of the Accelerated DirectFinancial Obligations, togeth
er with accrued interest thereon, and in case of certain indebtedness, premium, if any, thereon, immediately became due and payable.However, any efforts to enforc
e such payment obligations are automatically stayed as of the Petition Date, and are subject to the applicable provisions of theBankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankrupt
cy Court. The material Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations include all outstanding senior notes, agreements inrespect of certain s
eries of pollution control bonds, and PG&E Corporation's term loan facility, as well as short-term borrowings under PG&E Corporation’s andthe Utility’s revolving c
redit facilities and the Utility's term loan facility disclosed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.DIP Credit Agreement
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cas
es, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. As a result of the Bankruptcy Court’s interimapproval of the DIP Credit Agreem
ent on January 31, 2019, and the satisfaction of the other conditions thereof, the DIP Credit Agreement became effective onFebruary 1, 2019, and a portion of the DIP Revolving Fa
cility in the amount of $1.5 billion (including $750 million of the letter of credit subfacility) was madeavailable to PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility. As of February 28, 2019, the remainder of the DIP Revolving Facility (including the remainder of the $1.5 billion letter of credit sub
facility), the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility are unavailable for borrowing and will remainunavailable until and unl
ess the Bankruptcy Court approves the availability thereof following a final hearing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable topredict the date of th
e final hearing, but it is currently scheduled for March 13, 2019. There can be no assurances that the Bankruptcy Court will grant finalapproval of the DIP Faciliti
es at the final hearing, or at all.Borrowings under the DIP Credit Agreement 
are senior secured obligations of the Utility, secured by substantially all of the Utility’s assets and entitled tosuperpriority administ
rative expense claim status in the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case. The Utility’s obligations under the DIP Credit Agreement are guaranteed byPG&E Corporation, and such guarantee is 
a senior secured obligation of PG&E Corporation, secured by substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s assets andentitled to superprior
ity administrative expense claim status in PG&E Corporation’s Chapter 11 Case. The DIP Credit Agreement will mature on December 31,2020, subject to the Utility’s op
tion to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain terms and conditions are satisfied, including the payment of anextension fee. The Utility p
aid customary fees and expenses in connection with obtaining the DIP Credit Agreement. See Note 4 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8 for a more detailed description of the DIP Credit Agreement.As of February 28, 2019, the Utility had outst
anding borrowings of $350 million under the DIP Revolving Faci lity, and $30 million in face amount of outstand ingletters of credit, with remaini
ng availability of $1.12 billion under the DIP Revolving Facility. CPUC Authorization of DIP Credit Agreement
On January 28, 2019, the CPUC granted the Utility exe
mptions from the requirement of prior CPUC approval for issuance of debt instruments for the incurrence ofthe DIP financing. The CPUC also indicated i
ts position that the exemptions do not extend to the transfer of ownership of any Utility asset that is pledged as part ofthe DIP financing and that in th
e event of the Utility’s default under the DIP financing, the Utility would need to seek the CPUC’s approval to execute such atransfer. Further, the CPUC indicat
ed that the Utility’s “expenditure of the initial DIP financing funds for any purposes may not be recovered from ratepayerswithout Commission approval in a fu
ture application for rate recovery” and that the Utility “bears the burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of anyexpenditure.”

Pre-petition Debt and Equity FinancingsThere were no issuances under th
e PG&E Corporation February 2017 equity distribution agreement for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. During 2018, PG&E Corporation issued 5.6 million sha
res of common stock for cash proceeds of $199 million under the PG&E Corporation 401(k) plan andshare-based compensation p
lans. The proceeds from these sales were used for general corporate purposes. Beginning January 1, 2019, PG&E Corporation'smatching contributions unde
r its 401(k) plan are deposited in cash.During the first quarter o
f 2018, the Utility satisfied and discharged its remaining obligation of $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 8.25% Senior Notesdue October 15, 2018.
In February 2018, the Utility’s $250 m
illion floating rate unsecured term loan, issued in February 2017, matured and was repaid. In February 2018, the Utilityentered into a new $250 mill
ion floating rate unsecured term loan. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion ofthe Utility’s outstanding co
mmercial paper. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Utility's obligation to repay this loan, which was scheduled to mature onFebruary 22, 2019, has been stayed. 
In April 2018, PG&E Corporation entered in
to a $350 million floating rate unsecured term loan. The term loan was scheduled to mature on April 16, 2020. As aresult of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corpora
tion's obligation to repay this loan has been stayed. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes,including the early red
emption of PG&E Corporation’s outstanding $350 million principal amount of 2.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2019. On April 26, 2018,PG&E Corporation completed the e
arly redemption of these bonds, which satisfied and discharged its remaining obligation of $350 million.In August 2018, the Utility issued $500 mil
lion principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due August 1, 2023 and $300 million principal amount of 4.65% seniornotes due August 1, 2028. The proceeds were used to 
repay $500 million floating rate Senior Notes due November 28, 2018 and for general corporate purposes.In November 2018, the Utility’s $500 m
illion floating rate unsecured term loan, issued in November 2017, matured and was repaid.In December 2018, the Utility
’s $45 million principal amount of 1.05% Series 2008 G pollution control bonds matured and were repaid.In November 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity drew all amounts available under their respective revolving credit facilities in the amount of $300 millionand $2.85 billion, respective
ly. At December 31, 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had aggregate borrowings outstanding under their respective revolvingcredit facilit
ies of $300 million and $2.965 billion, respectively.  The Utility’s aggregate borrowings under its revolving credit facility includes $2.85 billion ofrevolving credit loans, and 
approximately $80 million of letters of credit outstanding.  See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Dividends
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directo
rs of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s common stock, beginn
ing the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018,due to the uncertainty r
elated to the causes of and potential liabilities associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. (See Note 13 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.)67

Utility Cash FlowsThe Utility’s cash flows were as 
follows: 
Year Ended December 31,  (in millions)
2018  2017  2016 Net cash provided by operating a
ctivities$ 4,704  $5,916  $4,344 Net cash used in investing act
ivities(6,564 )  (5,650 )  (5,753 ) Net cash provided by financing a
ctivities2,708  110  1,194 Net change in cash and cash equivalents
$ 848  $376  $(215 )Operating Activities
The Utility’s cash flows from op
erating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such asdepreciation that do not 
require the use of cash.  During 2018, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $ 1.2 billion compared to 2017.  This decreasewas due to an increase in costs 
for clean-up and repair, and legal and other costs related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, as well asenhanced vegetation man
agement work, and due to fluctuations in activities within the normal course of business such as the timing and amount of customerbillings and collections 
and vendor billings and payments. Additionally, the Utility paid $59 million in income taxes in 2018, as compared to receiving a refund of$162 million in 2017.
During 2017, net cash provided by operat
ing activities increased by $1.6 billion compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to additional electric andnatural gas operating r
evenues collected as authorized by the CPUC in the 2015 GT&S rate case, the $400 million refund to natural gas customers in the secondquarter of 2016, as required by 
the San Bruno Penalty Decision (with no corresponding activity in 2017), and the receipt of approximately $300 million ofinsurance recoveries 
related to the 2015 Butte fire in 2017 as compared to $50 million of insurance recoveries related to the 2015 Butte fire during 2016.The Utility will continue to op
erate its business as a debtor in possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with applicableprovisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the o
rders of the Bankruptcy Court.  Future cash flow from operating activities will be affected by various ongoingactivities, including:
•
the timing and amounts of costs, including fines and penalties, that may be incurred in connection with current and future enforcement, litigation, andregulatory matters 
(see Note 13 and “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. andItem 3. Legal Proceedings fo
r more information);•
the timing and amount of premium payments related to wildfire insurance (see “Wildfire Insurance” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8 fo
r more information);•
the Tax Act, which may accelerate the timing of federal tax payments and reduce revenue requirements, resulting in lower operating cash flowsdepending on the timing of wildf
ire payments (see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and “Regulatory Matters”below for more informat
ion);•
the timing and outcomes of the 2019 GT&S rate case, 2020 GRC, FERC TO18, TO19 and TO20 rate cases, 2018 CEMA filing, 2020 Cost of Capital,NDCTP, and other ratemaking and regula
tory proceedings; and•
the timing and amount of substantially increasing costs in connection with the 2019 Wildfire Safety Plan (see “Overview” above and “RegulatoryMatters” below for more 
information).68

The Utility had material obligations outstanding as of the Petition Date, including claims related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.Any efforts to enforce such pay
ment obligations are automatically stayed as of the Petition Date, and are subject to the applicable provisions of the BankruptcyCode and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Futur
e cash flows will be materially impacted by the timing and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases.Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing act
ivities increased by $ 914 million during 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase of approximately $873 million incapital expenditures. Ne
t cash used in investing activities increased by $124 million during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in capitalexpenditures. The 
Utility’s investing activities primarily consist of the construction of new and replacement facilities necessary to provide safe and reliableelectricity and na
tural gas services to its customers.  Cash used in investing activities also includes the proceeds from sales of nuclear decommissioning trustinvestments which are la
rgely offset by the amount of cash used to purchase new nuclear decommissioning trust investments.  The funds in the decommissioningtrusts, along with accumula
ted earnings, are used exclusively for decommissioning and dismantling the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.Future cash flows used in investing a
ctivities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incurapproximately $7.1 billion 
in capital expenditures in 2019, and $6.9 billion in 2020.Financing Activities
During 2018, net cash provided by financ
ing activities increased by $ 2.6 billion as compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to borrowings underrevolving credit facilities.
Cash provided by or used in financing a
ctivities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by or used in operatingactivities, the lev
el of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date of existing debt instruments.  TheUtility generally uti
lizes long-term debt issuances, retained earnings, and equity contributions from PG&E Corporation to maintain its CPUC-authorized capitalstructure, and relies on sho
rt-term debt to fund temporary financing needs.CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS

         (1) Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt. Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate at December 31, 2018 and outstanding principal for each instrument with the terms ending at each instrument’s maturity. The commencement of the Chap
ter 11 Cases constituted an event of default or termination event under the long term debt summarized in the tableabove. For more information, see “Liquidity and Financial Resources - Financial Resources - Acceleration of Pre-petition Debt Obliga
tions” in Item 7. MD&A and Note 4 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial Statements in Ite
m 8.(2) 
See “Purchase Commitments” and “Other Commitments” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.(3) 
See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annual contribution requirements. As theseannual requirements continue indefinitely into the future, the amoun
t shown in the column entitled “more than 5 years” represents only 1 year of contributions for the Utility’s pension andother benefit plans.
(4) 
Beginning with the three-month period ending January 31, 2018, quarterly cash dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock were suspended.  While the timing of cumulative dividend paymentsis uncertain, it is assumed for the table above to be payable within a fixed period of five years based on historical performance.  (See Note 6 of the Consolida
ted Financial Statements in Item8.)         
 The contractual comm
itments table above excludes potential payments associated with unrecognized tax positions.  Due to the uncertainty surrounding tax audits,PG&E Corporation and the Utility canno
t make reliable estimates of the amounts and periods of future payments to major tax jurisdictions related to unrecognizedtax benefits.  Matters 
relating to tax years that remain subject to examination are discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8. (For more information, se
e “Liquidity and Financial Resources - Financial Resources - Acceleration of Pre-petition Debt Obligations” in Item 7. MD&A.)Subject to certain exc
eptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may assume, assign or reject certain executory contracts andunexpired leases, subject 
to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and satisfaction of certain other conditions. Generally, the rejection of an executory contract orunexpired lease is tre
ated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves PG&E Corporation andthe Utility of perform
ing their respective future obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease but entitles the contract counterparty or lessor to apre-petition genera
l unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach. Generally, the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease willrequire PG&E Corporation or the Uti
lity, as applicable, to cure existing monetary and non-monetary defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease and
provide adequate assurance of future performance. Accordingly, any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease with PG&E Corporation or the Utilityin this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including wher
e applicable a quantification of the obligations under any such executory contract or unexpired lease, isqualified by any overriding 
assumption or rejection rights PG&E Corporation or the Utility, as applicable, has under the Bankruptcy Code. Further, nothing hereinis or shall be deemed to be 
an admission with respect to any claim amounts or calculations arising from the rejection of any executory contract or unexpired leaseand PG&E Corporation and the Utility exp
ressly reserve all of their rights with respect thereto.69

As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to evaluate if they will seek to assume or reject any powerpurchase agreement in 
connection with the Chapter 11 Cases. Any decision to assume or reject any power purchase agreement will be made by PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s management in consideration of then-existing economic, regulatory, market and legal conditions and other relevant considerations,subject to the Bankruptcy Court and po
tentially other approvals.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not hav
e any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future materialeffect on their fin
ancial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources,other than those discussed under "Pur
chase Commitments" in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.ENFORCEMENT AND LITIGATI
ON MATTERSPG&E Corporation and the Utility have s
ignificant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to the enforcement and litigationmatters described in Not
es 13 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. and Legal Proceedings in Item 3. The outcome of thesematters, individually o
r in the aggregate, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,and cash flows.
REGULATORY MATTERS
The Utility is subject to subst
antial regulation by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC, and other federal and state regulatory agencies. The resolutions of theproceedings described below and o
ther proceedings may materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,and cash flows.
2017 General Rate Case
On May 11, 2017, the CPUC issued a final decision in the Ut
ility’s 2017 GRC, which determined the annual amount of base revenues (or “revenue requirements”)that the Utility is autho
rized to collect from customers from 2017 through 2019 to recover its anticipated costs for electric distribution, natural gas distribution, andelectric genera
tion operations and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return. The final decision approved, with certain modifications,the settlement agr
eement that the Utility, PAO, TURN, and 12 other intervening parties jointly submitted to the CPUC on August 3, 2016. Consistent with theamounts proposed in the settl
ement agreement, the final decision approved a revenue requirement increase of $88 million for 2017, with additional increases of$444 million in 2018 and $361 million 
in 2019.On September 24, 2018, the CPUC approved the Utility's adv
ice letter proposal to make a one-time reduction to revenues by approximately $21 million. Thisadvice letter was dir
ected by an ALJ ruling in response to the Utility's $300 million expense reduction announcement in January 2017.Also, as a result of the Tax Act, on Ma
rch 30, 2018, the Utility submitted to the CPUC a PFM of the CPUC’s final decision in the 2017 GRC. The PFM, if adopted,would reduce revenue requir
ements by $267 million and $296 million for 2018 and 2019 respectively, and increase rate base by $199 million and $425 million for2018 and 2019, respectively. The Util
ity cannot predict the timing and outcome of this PFM.70

The Utility provided an update of the cost effectiveness study for the SmartMeter TM Upgrade project to the CPUC on July 10, 2017. On January 31, 2019, theCPUC extended the statutory deadline 
for the 2017 GRC to August 9, 2019, in order to allow for comments and CPUC action on any PD on the SmartMeter TMupgrade cost effectiv
eness study. The Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of any CPUC action in connection with this study and its impact on the 2017GRC revenue requirement and ra
te base.2020 General Rate Case
On December 13, 2018, the Utility fi
led its 2020 GRC application with the CPUC. In the 2020 GRC, the Utility has requested that the CPUC determine the annualamount of base revenues (or "
revenue requirements") that the Utility will be authorized to collect from customers from 2020 through 2022 to recover its anticipatedcosts for electric d
istribution, natural gas distribution, and electric generation operations and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate ofreturn. The Utility's reques
t also reflects an updated capital forecast for 2018 and 2019. The 2020 GRC application also includes recorded costs for 2017 andupdated forecasts for th
e proposed mitigations for the period 2018 through 2022 for the Utility's top safety-related risks as presented in the Utility's November2017 RAMP report.
For 2020, the Utility has requested b
ase revenues of $9.6 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 12.4%, as compared to authorized base revenues for 2019. Therequested weighted averag
e rate base for 2020 is approximately $30 billion, which corresponds to an increase of $2.7 billion over the 2019 authorized rate base of$27.3 billion. The Utility also r
equested that the CPUC establish a ratemaking mechanism that would increase the Utility's authorized revenues in 2021 and 2022by $454 million and $486 million, r
espectively. Over the 2020-2022 GRC period, the Utility plans to make average annual capital investments of approximately$4.5 billion in electric 
distribution, natural gas distribution and electric generation infrastructure, and to improve safety, reliability, and customer service.The following tables compar

 (1) The Utility's GRC forecast indicates that future liability insurance premium costs will be approximately $355 million in 2020Among other things, the Utility propos
es to invest a total of approximately $5 billion (including approximately $3 billion for capital expenditures) between 2018and 2022 on CWSP measures. Through this program, th
e Utility proposes to bolster wildfire prevention, risk monitoring, emergency response efforts, and add newand enhanced safety meas
ures, increase vegetation management and harden its electric system to help further reduce wildfire risks.In addition, the Utility r
equests authorization to establish several new balancing accounts, including:•
a two-way electric and gas Risk Transfer Balancing Account to record the difference between the amounts adopted for liability insurance premiums andthe Utility's actual cos
ts; this two-way account would allow the Utility to pass-through actual insurance costs for up to $2 billion in coverage and return tocustomers any overcolle
ction if forecast costs exceed actuals costs; and•
a two-way Wildfire Safety Balancing Account to track and record actual incremental expenses and capital revenue requirements associated with theincremental costs of 
fire risk mitigation work that are not already addressed and recorded in another account; this would include the costs associated withoverhead system hardening, enh
anced vegetation management, and other incremental costs of wildfire mitigations that are approved by the CPUC in theUtility's annual wildfire 
mitigation plan. In accordance with SB 901, the Utility submitted its first Wildfire Safety Plan to the CPUC on February 6, 2019.This GRC proposal does not request funding for pot
ential lawsuits or claims resulting from the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. Also, theUtility is not seeking recov
ery of compensation of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s officers. In addition, the Chapter 11 Cases may impact the amount ofwork the Utility can commi
t to financing and require a change to the scope of work that the Utility proposes to accomplish in the 2020 GRC period.In its application, the Ut
ility requests that the CPUC issue a final decision by March 2020 and that the 2020 GRC rates be effective January 1, 2020. Theprehearing conferenc
e was held February 11, 2019, to set a procedural schedule, including the dates for interested parties to submit testimony and for evidentiaryhearings.
2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case
In its final decisions in 
the Utility's 2015 GT&S rate case, the CPUC excluded from rate base $696 million of capital spending in 2011 through 2014. This was theamount recorded in excess o
f the amount adopted in the 2011 GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed $120 million of that amount and ordered thatthe remaining $576 mill
ion be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek recovery in a future proceeding. TheUtility would be required to t
ake a charge in the future if the CPUC’s audit of 2011 through 2014 capital spending resulted in additional permanent disallowance.The audit is still in proc
ess. The Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of the audit.As a result of the Tax Act, on March 30, 2018, 
the Utility submitted to the CPUC a PFM of the CPUC's final decision in the 2015 GT&S rate case proposing toreduce revenue requir
ements by $58 million and increase rate base by $12 million for 2018 (excluding the impacts of an approximately $7 million increase inrevenue requirement 
and a $60 million increase in rate base associated with the Utility's private letter ruling advice letter approved by the CPUC on July 18, 2018).The Utility cannot predic
t the timing and outcome of this PFM.72

2019 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate CaseOn November 17, 2017, the Utility filed 
its 2019 GT&S rate case application with the CPUC for the years 2019 through 2021. The Utility also provided a revenuerequirement and rat
es for 2022, in the event the CPUC adopts an additional year. On October 1, 2018, the Utility entered into a stipulation with PAO that, ifapproved, would extend the rate 
case cycle through 2022 as recommended by PAO.In its application, the Ut
ility requested that the CPUC authorize a 2019 revenue requirement of $1.59 billion to recover anticipated costs of providing natural gastransmission and storage se
rvices beginning on January 1, 2019. This corresponds to an increase of $289 million over the Utility’s 2018 authorized revenuerequirement of $1.30 bill
ion. The Utility’s request also proposed revenue requirements of $1.73 billion for 2020, $1.91 billion for 2021, and $1.91 billion for 2022if the CPUC orders a fourth year for 
the rate case period.The Utility subsequently revis
ed its forecast revenue requirement as a result of the Tax Act and other forecast updates, including significant reductions in the areasof gas storage facili
ties and gas system operations programs. The revised revenue requirements are as follows: $1.48 billion for 2019, $1.59 billion for 2020, $1.69billion for 2021, and $1.68 billion fo
r 2022. The revised 2019 requested revenue requirement corresponds to an increase of $184 million over the Utility's 2018authorized revenue requirement.
The requested rate base 
for 2019 is $4.75 billion, which corresponds to an increase of $1.04 billion over the 2018 adopted rate base of $3.71 billion. The Utility’srequest is based on capita
l expenditure forecasts of $829 million for 2019, $872 million for 2020, and $825 million for 2021 (which exclude common capitalallocations). The reques
ted rate base amounts exclude approximately $576 million of capital spending subject to audit by the CPUC related to 2011 through 2014expenditures in excess of a
mounts adopted in the 2011 GT&S rate case. The Utility is unable to predict whether the $576 million, or a portion thereof, willultimately be approved by 
the CPUC and included in the Utility’s future rate base.The requested increase in
 revenue requirement is largely attributable to increased infrastructure investment and costs related to new natural gas storage safety andenvironmental regula
tions issued by DOGGR, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and the CPUC.In response to the Utility's app
lication, parties proposed various forecast reductions. For example, the PAO recommended a 2019 revenue requirement of $1.35billion, an increase of $45 
million over 2018 adopted amounts. TURN proposed widespread reductions in forecast costs and recommended capital and expensedisallowances of more than $500 
million.A later phase of the proce
eding is expected to address the removal of officer compensation costs from the revenue requirement, which is required by SB 901. TheUtility is unable to predi
ct the timing and outcome of this proceeding.

Transmission Owner Rate CasesTransmission Owner Rate Cases for 2015 and 2016 (the “TO16” and “TO17” rate cases, respectively)
On January 8, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appea
ls issued an opinion granting an appeal of FERC’s decisions in the TO16 and TO17 rate cases that hadgranted the Utility a 50 bas
is point ROE incentive adder for its continued participation in the CAISO. Those rate case decisions have been remanded to FERC forfurther proceedings consis
tent with the Court of Appeals’ opinion. If FERC concludes on remand that the Utility should no longer be authorized to receive the 50basis point ROE incentive adder, th
e Utility would incur a refund obligation of $1 million and $8.5 million for TO16 and TO17, respectively. Alternatively, ifFERC again concludes that the Utili
ty should receive the 50 basis point ROE incentive adder and provides the additional explanation that the Ninth Circuit foundthe FERC’s prior decisions lacked, th
en the Utility would not owe any refunds for this issue for TO16 or TO17.On February 28, 2018, the Utility filed 
a motion to establish procedures on remand requesting a hearing and additional briefing on the issues identified in the NinthCircuit Court's opinion. On August 20, 2018, FERC issued an order grant
ing the Utility's motion to allow for additional briefing. The order also consolidated theTO18 rate case with TO16 and TO17 for this issue. Th
e Utility filed briefs on September 19, 2018 and reply briefs on October 10, 2018. The Utility is unable topredict the timing and ou
tcome of FERC’s decision.Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2017 (the “TO18” rate case)
On July 29, 2016, the Utility filed its TO18 r
ate case at the FERC requesting a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.72 billion, a $387million increase ove
r the 2016 revenue requirement of $1.33 billion.  The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2017 was $6.7 billion.  The Utility isseeking a return on equity of 10.9
%, which includes an incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO.  In thefiling, the Utility for
ecasted that it would make investments of $1.30 billion in 2017 in various capital projects.On September 30, 2016, the FERC issued an order acc
epting the Utility’s July 2016 filing and set it for hearing, but held the hearing procedures in abeyance forsettlement procedur
es.  The order set an effective date for rates of March 1, 2017, and made the rates subject to refund following resolution of the case.  On March17, 2017, the FERC issued an order terminat
ing the settlement procedures due to an impasse in the settlement negotiations reported by the parties.  During thehearings held in January 2018, the Ut
ility, intervenors, and the FERC trial staff, addressed questions relating to return on equity, capital structure, depreciationrates, capital addi
tions, rate base, operating and maintenance expense, administrative and general expense, and the allocation of common, general and intangiblecosts.
On October 1, 2018, the ALJ issued an initial d
ecision in the TO18 rate case proposing an ROE of 9.13% compared to the Utility’s request of 10.90%, and anestimated composite d
epreciation rate of 2.96% compared to the Utility’s request of 3.25%. The ALJ also rejected the Utility's method of allocating common plantbetween CPUC and FERC jurisdiction. In addition, the ALJ proposed 
to reduce forecasted capital and expense spending to actual costs incurred for the rate caseperiod. Further, the ALJ proposed to re
move certain items from the Utility's rate base and revenue requirement. The Utility and intervenors filed initial briefs onOctober 31, 2018, and reply briefs on Novemb
er 20, 2018, in response to the ALJ's recommendations. The Utility expects FERC to issue a decision in mid-2019,but expects one or more par
ties to seek rehearing of that decision and then appeal it to the courts. The Utility is unable to predict the timing of when a final decisionwill be issued.
Additionally, on March 31, 2017, interv
enors in the TO18 rate case filed a complaint at the FERC alleging that the Utility failed to justify its proposed rate increasein the TO18 rate case. On November 16, 2017, th
e FERC dismissed the complaint. On December 18, 2017, the complainants filed a request for a rehearing of thatorder, which the FERC denied on May 17, 2018.
Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2018 (the “TO19” rate case)
On July 27, 2017, the Utility filed its TO19 r
ate case at the FERC requesting a 2018 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.79 billion, a $74 millionincrease over the proposed 2017 
revenue requirement of $1.72 billion. The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2018 is $6.9 billion.  The Utility isseeking an ROE of 10.75%, which includes an inc
entive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO.  In the filing, theUtility forecasted c
apital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion.  On September 28, 2017, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s July 2017 filing,subject to hearing and re
fund, and established March 1, 2018, as the effective date for rate changes.  FERC also ordered that the hearings be held in abeyancepending settlement discuss
ion among the parties. On May 14, 2018, the Utility filed a proposal to reflect the impact of the Tax Act on its TO tariff rates effectiveMarch 1, 2018, in the resolution of 
the TO19 rate case. The tax impact reduces the TO19 requested revenue requirement from $1.79 billion to $1.66 billion.74

On September 29, 2017, intervenors in the TO19 rate case filed a complaint at the FERC alleging that the Utility failed to justify its proposed rate increase in theTO19 rate case. On October 17, 2017, the Util
ity requested that the FERC dismiss the complaint. On May 17, 2018, the FERC issued an order setting thecomplaint for hearing, s
ettlement judge procedures, and consolidation with the TO19 proceeding.On September 21, 2018, the Utility fi
led an all-party settlement with FERC in connection with TO19. As part of the settlement, the TO19 revenue requirement willbe set at 98.85% of the revenu
e requirement for TO18 that will be determined in the TO18 final decision. Additionally, if FERC determines that the Utility is notentitled to the 50 basis poin
t incentive adder for the Utility's continued CAISO participation, than the Utility would be obligated to make a refund to customers ofapproximately $25 mill
ion. On December 20, 2018, FERC issued an order approving the all-party settlement.Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2019 (the “TO20” rate case)
On October 1, 2018, the Utility filed 
its TO20 rate case at FERC requesting approval of a formula rate for the costs associated with the Utility's electrictransmission facili
ties. On November 30, 2018, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility's October 2018 filing, subject to hearings and refund, andestablished May 1, 2019, as the ef
fective date for rate changes. FERC also ordered that the hearings will be held in abeyance pending settlement discussions amongthe parties. The Utility 
is unable to predict the timing and outcome of settlement discussions.The formula rate rep
laces the "stated rate" methodology that the Utility used in its previous TO rate case filings. The formula rate methodology still includes anauthorized revenue requ
irement and rate base for a given year, but it also provides for an annual update of the following year's revenue requirement and rates inaccordance with the te
rms of the FERC-approved formula. Under the formula rate mechanism, transmission revenues, including CWIP, will be updated to theactual cost of service ann
ually. Differences between amounts collected and determined under the formula rate will be either collected from or refunded tocustomers.
In the filing, the Utili
ty forecasts a 2019 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.96 billion. The proposed amount reflects an approximately 9.5%increase over the as-
filed TO19 requested revenue requirement of $1.79 billion (a subsequent reduction to $1.66 billion was identified as a result of the Tax Act).The Utility forecasts th
at it will make investments of approximately $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion for 2018 and 2019, respectively, for various capital projects to beplaced in service befo
re the end of 2019. Including projects to be placed in service beyond 2019, the Utility forecasts total electric transmission capitalexpenditures of $1.4 billion in 2018 
and $1.4 billion in 2019. The Utility's forecasted rate base for 2019 is approximately $8 billion on a weighted average basis,compared to the Utility's 
forecasted rate base of $6.9 billion in 2018. The Utility has requested that FERC approve a 12.5% return on equity (which includes anincentive component of 50 bas
is points for the Utility's continuing participation in the CAISO), an increase from the 10.75% (also inclusive of a 50 basis pointCAISO incentive adder) requested 
in its TO19 rate case. A settlement conference is scheduled for March 14 - 15, 2019.The Utility expects to fi
le an annual update to its TO tariff on or before December 1 of each year beginning in 2019, for rates and charges to become effectiveJanuary 1 of the following year, 
consistent with the formula rate.Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Triennial Proceeding
The Utility expects that 
the decommissioning of Diablo Canyon will take many years after the expiration of its current operating licenses. Detailed studies of thecost to decommission the Uti
lity’s nuclear generation facilities are conducted every three years in conjunction with the NDCTP. Actual decommissioning costsmay vary from these est
imates as a result of changes in assumptions such as regulatory requirements; technology; and costs of labor, materials, and equipment. TheUtility recovers its r
evenue requirements for decommissioning costs from customers through a non-bypassable charge that the Utility expects will continue untilthose costs are fully re
covered.On December 13, 2018, the Utility submi
tted its updated decommissioning cost estimate to the CPUC for Diablo Canyon based on a site-specific decommissioninganalysis. A prehearing confe
rence was held on February 6, 2019.75

For more information, see "Asset Retirement Obligations" in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account
On June 21, 2018, the CPUC issued a decision granting the Uti
lity’s request to establish a WEMA to track specific incremental wildfire liability costs effective asof July 26, 2017. In the WEMA, the Utility c
an record costs related to wildfires, including: (1) payments to satisfy wildfire claims, including any deductibles, co-insurance and other insuran
ce expense paid by the Utility but excluding costs that have already been forecasted and adopted in the Utility’s GRC; (2) outside legalcosts incurred in the def
ense of wildfire claims; (3) insurance premium costs not in rates; and (4) the cost of financing these amounts.  Insurance proceeds, as wellas any payments received 
from third parties, or through FERC authorized rates, will be credited to the WEMA as they are received.  The WEMA will not includethe Utility’s costs for f
ire response and infrastructure costs which are tracked in the CEMA.  The decision does not grant the Utility rate recovery of any wildfire-related costs. Any such rate 
recovery would require CPUC authorization in a separate proceeding. (See Notes 3 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.)
As of December 31, 2018, the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements include long-term regulatory assets of $94 million , consisting of insurance pre mium costs thatare probable of recove
ry. Should PG&E Corporation and the Utility conclude in future periods that recovery of insurance premiums in excess of amounts includedin authorized revenue r
equirements is no longer probable, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will record a charge in the period such conclusion is reached.Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account Applications
The CPUC allows utilities to recover 
the reasonable, incremental costs of responding to catastrophic events that have been declared a disaster or state of emergencyby competent federal o
r state authorities through a CEMA. In 2014, the CPUC directed the Utility to perform additional fire prevention and vegetationmanagement work in response to 
the severe drought in California. The costs associated with this work are tracked in the CEMA. While the Utility believes suchcosts are recoverabl
e through CEMA, its CEMA applications are subject to CPUC review and approval. For more information see Note 3 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.2016 CEMA Application
In 2016, the Utility submitted 
a request to the CPUC to authorize recovery under the CEMA tariff for a revenue requirement increase of approximately $146million for recorded 
capital and expense costs related to the 2015 drought mitigations and emergency response activities for declared disasters that occurred fromDecember 2012 through March 2016. On January 4, 2018, PAO, TURN, and the Utili
ty filed an all-party motion with the CPUC seeking approval of an all-partysettlement agreement. The settlement
 agreement proposed that the Utility’s total CEMA revenue requirement request be reduced by $29 million, from $146 millionto $117 million. On June 21, 2018, the CPUC approved the sett
lement agreement authorizing the Utility to recover $117 million in connection with its 2016CEMA application.
2018 CEMA Application
On March 30, 2018, the Utility submitt
ed to the CPUC its 2018 CEMA application requesting cost recovery of $183 million in connection with seven catastrophicevents that included fi
re and storm declared emergencies from mid-2016 through early 2017, as well as $405 million related to work performed in 2016 and 2017to cut back or remove dead o
r dying trees that were exposed to years of drought conditions and bark beetle infestation. Also, the 2018 CEMA application originallysought cost recovery of $555 mil
lion on a forecast basis, subject to true-up if actual costs were greater or less than the forecast, for additional tree mortality and firerisk mitigation work anti
cipated in 2018 and 2019. On October 12, 2018, the Utility notified the CPUC and other parties that $180 million of the forecasted 2018and 2019 fire risk mitiga
tion costs would be removed from CEMA and instead pursued in the FHPMA. Upon removal of the $180 million, the Utility's forecast ofcosts for 2018 and 2019 sought in the appli
cation would be approximately $375 million. The 2018 CEMA application does not include costs related to the 2015Butte fire, the 2017 Northern Cal
ifornia wildfires, or the 2018 Camp fire.76

On November 2, 2018, the assigned ALJ denied the Utility's July 25, 2018 motion requesting interim rate relief for $441 million, which represents 75% of the costsincurred in 2016 and 2017 relat
ed to storms, wildfires and tree mortality response work. Subsequently, on December 4, 2018, the Utility filed a renewed motion forinterim rate re
lief, due to worsening financial conditions. The renewed motion for interim relief sought approximately $588 million, which represents 100% of thetotal costs incurred in 2016 
and 2017 for the activities referenced above. The Utility requested that the interim rate relief begins on March 1, 2019 and costrecovery occurs over a one
-year period, with the amounts collected to be subject to refund based on the authorized amount in the proceeding.On February 5, 2019, the assigned ALJs issued a PD on the Utili
ty's renewed motion for interim rate relief, granting interim rate recovery “in an amount no greaterthan and possibly less than $373 mil
lion” of its recorded 2016 and 2017 CEMA costs, as compared to approximately $588 million requested by the Utility, subjectto ensuring that the overa
ll impact would result in no rate increase as compared to revenue at present rates. If adopted, the PD would also require the Utility torefund, with interest, any ex
cess rate recovery amount it obtained in comparison to the final decision in this proceeding regarding the total approved 2016 and 2017CEMA costs. Further, the PD rejected the Ut
ility’s $555 million cost recovery request, on a forecast basis, for 2018 and 2019 anticipated costs for tree mortalityand fire risk mitiga
tion work. The PD finds, among other things, that the applicable CPUC resolution does not authorize recovery of CEMA eligible costs on aforecast basis. The Utili
ty expects that the CPUC will vote on the PD no earlier than March 14, 2019.PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e unable to predict the timing and outcome of this proceeding.Fire Hazard Prevention Memorandum Account
The CPUC allows utilities to track and 
record costs associated with the implementation of regulations and requirements adopted to protect the public fro m potentialfire hazards associated wit
h overhead power line facilities and nearby aerial communication facilities that have not been previously authorized in anotherproceeding. The Utility cur
rently is authorized to track such costs in the FHPMA through the end of 2019. During 2018, the Utility recorded $262 million of costs to the FHPMA, corresponding to vegetation m
anagement work performed to comply with CPUC December 2017 fire safety regulations. While the Utility believessuch costs are recoverab
le, rate recovery requires CPUC authorization in a separate proceeding or through a GRC. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8.)Other Regulatory Proceedings
2019 Wildfire Safety Plan
On October 25, 2018, the CPUC opened an OIR to implement the p
rovisions of SB 901 related to electric utility wildfire mitigation plans. This OIR providedguidance on the form and cont
ent of the initial wildfire mitigation plans, provided a venue for review of the initial plans, and developed and refined the content ofand process for review and imp
lementation of wildfire mitigation plans to be filed in future years. In this proceeding the CPUC will consider, among other things,how to interpret and apply SB 901’s list o
f required plan elements, as well as whether additional elements beyond those required in SB 901 should be included inthe wildfire mitiga
tion plans. SB 901 also requires, among other things, that such plans include a description of the preventive strategies and programs to beadopted by an electric
al corporation to minimize the risk of its electrical lines and equipment causing catastrophic wildfires, including the consideration of dynamicclimate change risks, plan
s for vegetation management, and plans for inspections of the electrical corporation’s electrical infrastructure. The scope of thisproceeding does not include ut
ility recovery of costs related to wildfire mitigation plans, which SB 901 requires be addressed in separate rate recovery applications.On February 6, 2019, the Utility filed 
its wildfire mitigation plan with the CPUC. The 2019 Wildfire Safety Plan also describes forecasted work and investments in2019 that are designed to help 
further reduce the potential for wildfire ignitions associated with the Utility’s electrical equipment in high fire-threat areas. The 2019Wildfire Safety Plan spe
cifically addresses wildfire risk factors that occur most frequently and have potential to start or spread a fire. The new and ongoing safetymeasures being pursued includ
e:•
Installing nearly 600 new, high-definition cameras, made available to Cal Fire and local fire officials, in high fire-threat areas by 2022, increasingcoverage across high fire-t
hreat areas to more than 90%;•
Adding approximately 1,300 additional new weather stations by 2022, at a density of one station roughly every 20 circuit miles in high fire-threat areas;77

•Conducting enhanced safety inspections of electric infrastructure in high-fire threat areas, including approximately 735,000 electric towers and polesacross approximately 5,700 t
ransmission line miles and 25,200 distribution line miles;•
Further enhancing vegetation management efforts across high and extreme fire-threat areas to address vegetation that poses higher potential for wildfirerisk, such as removi
ng or trimming trees from particular 'at-risk' tree species that have exhibited a higher pattern of failing;•
Continuing to disable automatic reclosing in high fire-threat areas during wildfire season and periods of high fire-risk and upgrading more reclosers andcircuit breakers in high fire-t
hreat areas with remote control capabilities•
Installing stronger and more resilient poles and covered power lines, including targeted undergrounding, starting in areas with the highest fire risk,ultimately upgrading and s
trengthening approximately 7,100 miles over the next 10 years; and•
Partnering with additional communities in high fire-threat areas to create new resilience zones that can power central community resources during aPublic Safety Power Shutoff.
The CPUC is expected to issue a decision in 
the second quarter of 2019. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding.OIR to Implement Public Utilities Code Se
ction 451.2 Regarding Criteria and Methodology for Wildfire Cost Recovery Pursuant to Senate Bill 901SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requir
es the CPUC to establish a customer harm threshold, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances inthe aggregate, so that th
ey do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming ratepayers or materially impacting its ability to provideadequate and safe servi
ce (the “Customer Harm Threshold”). SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through theissuance of recovery bonds (a
lso referred to as “securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017Northern California wildfi
res, any amounts in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. SB 901 does not authorize securitization with respect to possible 2018Camp fire costs, as the bil
l does not address fires that occurred in 2018.78

On January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a process to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the CustomerHarm Threshold in future appl
ications under Section 451.2(a) of the Public Utilities Code. In the OIR, the CPUC stated that “consistent with Section 451.2(a), thedetermination of what cos
ts and expenses are just and reasonable must be made in the context of an application for the recovery of specific costs related to the 2017wildfires.” Based on the CPUC’s interpre
tation of Section 451.2 as outlined in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that any securitization of costsrelating to the 2017 Northern Ca
lifornia wildfires would not occur, if at all, until (a) the Utility has paid claims relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires,(b) the Utility has fil
ed application for recovery of such costs and (c) the CPUC makes a determination that such costs are just and reasonable or in excess of theCustomer Harm Threshold. PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility therefore do not expect the CPUC to permit the Utility to securitize costs relating to the 2017Northern California wildfi
res on an expedited or emergency basis. Based on the OIR, as well as prior experience and precedent, and unless the CPUC alters theposition expressed in the OIR, PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility believe it likely would take several years to obtain authorization to securitize any amountsrelating to the 2017 Northern Ca
lifornia wildfires.On February 11, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed opening comments in response to the OIR in which they argued, among other things, the CPUCshould (1) promptly set a Custome
r Harm Threshold, or at least define the methodology for setting the Customer Harm Threshold with sufficient specificity toenable PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity and potential investors to anticipate that amount; (2) determine the Customer Harm Threshold based on the capitalneeded to resolve clai
ms arising from both the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires to be provided for in a plan of reorganization; (3) definehow the Customer Harm Threshold will be 
applied to any future wildfires; and (4) establish the Customer Harm Threshold based on the amount of debt PG&ECorporation and the Utility c
an raise. Based on assumptions set forth in the comments, PG&E Corporation and the Utility indicated that they could borrow up toapproximately $3 billion 
to fund wildfire claims costs as part of a plan of reorganization.Transportation Electrification
California Law SB 350 requires the CPUC, in consulta
tion with the California Air Resources Board and the CEC, to direct electrical corporations to fileapplications for progra
ms and investments to accelerate widespread TE. In September 2016, the CPUC directed the Utility and the other large IOUs to file TEapplications that inc
lude both short-term projects (of up to $20 million in total) and two-to-five year programs with a requested revenue requirement determined bythe Utility.
On May 31, 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision approving 
the Utility’s standard review program proposals for actual expenditures up to approximately $269million (including $198 mi
llion of capital expenditures), to support make-ready infrastructure supporting public fast charging and medium to heavy-duty fleets. Inthe FleetReady program, the Ut
ility has a goal of providing utility-owned make-ready infrastructure at 700 sites, conducting operation and maintenance of installedinfrastructure, and edu
cating customers on the benefits of electric vehicles. The final decision gives customers the option of self-funding, installing, owning, andmaintaining the make-ready infra
structure installed beyond the customer meter in lieu of utility ownership, after which they would receive a utility rebate for aportion of those costs. The Fast Charge p
rogram has a goal to install make-ready infrastructure at approximately 52 public charging sites amounting to roughly 234DC fast chargers.
On December 19, 2018, the CPUC initiated a new Rulem
aking for vehicle electrification matters (R. 18-12-006). This new proceeding will include issues related toutility rate designs suppor
ting transportation electrification and hydrogen fueling stations, a framework for IOUs' transportation electrification investments, andvehicle-grid integr
ation. A pre-hearing conference for this rulemaking is expected in the first quarter of 2019, with a scoping memo to follow that conference.Electric Distribution Resources Plan
As required by California law, on July 1, 2015, 
the Utility filed its proposed electric DRP for approval by the CPUC.  The Utility’s DRP identifies its approach foridentifying optimal lo
cations on its electric distribution system for deployment of DERs.  The Utility’s DRP approach is designed to allow distributed energytechnologies to be integr
ated into the larger grid while continuing to provide customers with safe, reliable, and affordable electric service. 79

As part of the Utility’s DRP approach, on June 1, 2018, the Utility filed its first annual distribution grid needs assessment report with the CPUC, and on September4, 2018, the Utility filed its 
first distribution deferral opportunity report. The distribution deferral report proposes cost effective electric distribution investmentsthat can be deferred 
through deployment of dispatchable third-party owned DERs, or non-wire alternative solutions, to operate during specific grid events.  TheUtility convened a distribu
tion planning advisory group comprised of CPUC staff, ratepayer and environmental advocates, and DER market participants, to reviewand provide advisory input to the Ut
ility on its distribution deferral identification process and to identify distribution deferral opportunities.  After incorporating theadvisory group’s input, on November 28, 2018, the Ut
ility filed a proposal with the CPUC for competitively procuring distribution services from third-party ownedDERs to defer selected distr
ibution deferral opportunities.  The Utility expects to launch competitive solicitations following the CPUC’s approval of the Utility’sprocurement plan.
On March 26, 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision r
equiring the Utility to include a grid modernization plan for integrating DERs in the Utility's GRC.  Thegrid modernization plan 
for DERs must include a narrative 10-year vision for investments needed to support DER growth, while ensuring safety and servicereliability.  On June 25, 2018, the Uti
lity hosted a public grid modernization workshop for integrating DERs to provide a high-level overview of its vision and 10-year plan and incorporat
e stakeholder input.  On December 13, 2018, the Utility filed its 2020 GRC Application, which includes the Utility’s grid modernizationvision and plan.
OIR to Consider Strategies and Guidance for Climate Change Adaptation
On April 26, 2018, the CPUC opened an OIR to consider strategi
es for integrating climate change adaptation matters into relevant CPUC proceedings.  Phase onewill focus on how to integrate c
limate change adaptation into the IOUs’ existing planning and operations to ensure utility safety and reliability.The CPUC OIR will consider:
•
how to define climate change adaption for the IOUs;•
the climate-driven risks facing the IOUs;•
data, tools, resources, and guidance to instruct utilities on how to incorporate adaption in their existing planning and operational processes; and•
strategies to address climate change in CPUC proceedings, including impacts on disadvantaged communities.On October 10, 2018, the CPUC issued a scoping memo and estab
lished a procedural schedule. A final decision is expected in late 2019.80

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVESSenate Bill 901
SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requir
es the CPUC to establish a Customer Harm Threshold (as defined herein), directing the CPUC to limitcertain disallowances 
in the aggregate, so that they do not exceed the Customer Harm Threshold. SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order thatpermits recovery, through 
the issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as “securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by theCPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wild
fires, any amounts in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. SB 901 does not authorize securitization withrespect to possible 2018 Camp fi
re costs, as the bill does not address fires that occurred in 2018.On January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a pro
cess to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the CustomerHarm Threshold in future appl
ications under Section 451.2(a) of the Public Utilities Code for cost recovery of 2017 wildfire costs. In the OIR, the CPUC statedthat “consistent with Sect
ion 451.2(a), the determination of what costs and expenses are just and reasonable must be made in the context of an application for therecovery of specific 
costs related to the 2017 wildfires.” Based on the CPUC’s interpretation of Section 451.2 as outlined in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and theUtility believe that 
any securitization of costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires would not occur, if at all, until (a) the Utility has paid claimsrelating to the 2017 Northern Ca
lifornia wildfires, (b) the Utility has filed application for recovery of such costs, and (c) the CPUC makes a determination that suchcosts are just and reasonab
le or in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. PG&E Corporation and the Utility therefore do not expect the CPUC to permit theUtility to securitiz
e costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires on an expedited or emergency basis. Based on the OIR, as well as prior experience andprecedent, and unless the CPUC alters 
the position expressed in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it likely would take several years to obtainauthorization to secur
itize any amounts relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires.On February 11, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed opening comments in response to the OIR. (See “Regulatory Matters - OIR to Implement PublicUtilities Code Section 451.2 Regarding Cr
iteria and Methodology for Wildfire Cost Recovery Pursuant to Senate Bill 901” above.)In addition, SB 901 requires utili
ties to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the CPUC on a schedule to be established by the CPUC.  Thewildfire mitigation p
lan must include the components specified in SB 901, such as identification and prioritization of wildfire risks, and drivers for those risks;plans for vegetation man
agement; actions to harden the system, prepare for, and respond to events; and protocols for disabling reclosers and deenergizing thesystem.  The CPUC has three months to approve a u
tility’s plan, with the ability to extend the deadline.  The CPUC will conduct an annual compliance review,which will be supported by an independen
t evaluator’s report.  The CPUC will complete the compliance review within 18 months.  SB 901 establishes factors to beconsidered by the CPUC when setting penalti
es for failure to substantially comply with the plan.  Costs associated with the wildfire mitigation plan are tracked in amemorandum account, and th
e costs of implementing the plan will be assessed in each utility’s General Rate Case proceeding, or other application proceedings. The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing or outcome of the CPUC’s review of the wildfire mitigation plan, the results of the CPUC compliance review of wildfiremitigation plan implementation,
 or the timing or extent of cost recovery for wildfire mitigation plan activities.Finally, SB 901 established a Commission on Cat
astrophic Wildfire Cost and Recovery to evaluate wildfire reforms, including inverse condemnation reform, apotential state wildf
ire insurance fund, and other wildfire mitigation measures. The commission, which will be composed of members with demonstrated expertisein insurance, public and priv
ate utilities, or allocation of costs and reduction of damage associated with wildfires, will hold multiple meetings throughout the stateto accept public and expe
rt testimony and develop recommendations. The commission, in consultation with the CPUC and California Insurance Commissioner,will prepare a report on o
r before July 1, 2019, that contains an assessment of issues surrounding catastrophic wildfire costs and damages and makesrecommendations for ch
anges to the law. The recommendations of the commission and the response by the Governor and legislature to those recommendationscould materially a
ffect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.81

Power Charge Indifference Adjustment OIROn October 11, 2018, the CPUC approved a decision to modify 
the PCIA methodology, which was developed after the 2001 California energy crisis, which adjustshow customers that leave th
e Utility's bundled service for CCA or Direct Access service, pay for their share of the costs associated with long-term power purchasecommitments made on their be
half. The decision better enables utilities to recover their above market costs from departing customers as compared to the previousmethodology, by:
•
adopting benchmark values used to set the PCIA rate that more closely resemble actual market prices for resource adequacy and renewable energy credits;•
continuing to allow legacy utility-owned generation costs to be recovered from CCA customers;•
eliminating the 10-year limit on PCIA cost recovery for post-2002 utility owned generation and certain storage costs; and•
adding an annual true-up to the PCIA rate based on market sales.The Utility anticipat
es the revised PCIA rate to go into effect as of May 1, 2019.On December 19, 2018, a prehearing con
ference was held to initiate phase 2 of the PCIA proceeding, to further develop proposals for future consideration by theCPUC. On February 1, 2019, the assigned commissioner issued 
a phase 2 scoping memo and ruling, which sets forth the category, issues, need for hearing,schedule, and other matt
ers. As indicated in the scoping memo and ruling, phase 2 of this proceeding will primarily rely upon a working group process to furtherdevelop a number of PCIA-relat
ed proposals for consideration by the CPUC, which include benchmark true-up for brown power resource adequacy and renewableenergy credits, rate d
esign mechanics, portfolio optimization and cost reduction, allocation and auctions, whether the Commission should consider new or modifiedshareholder responsibili
ty for future portfolio mismanagement, if any, and CCA and DA prepayment options. The schedule included in the scoping memo andruling indicates that 
the CPUC is expected to issue decisions on several topics covered by this OIR starting in late 2019 and extending through 2020.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health ofthe Utility’s personnel and 
the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardouswastes; the reporting and r
eduction of carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting of safety andreliability measu
res for natural gas storage facilities; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors,"Environmental Regulation" in 
Item 1. and "Environmental Remediation Contingencies" in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8.)
RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
PG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownersh
ip of the Utility, and the Utility are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interestrates, and counterparty 
credit. The Utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourageunauthorized risk-taking, 
reduce commodity cost volatility, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non-trading purposes (i.e.,risk mitigation) and not 
for speculative purposes.Commodity Price Risk
The Utility is exposed to commod
ity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas andnuclear fuel necessary for electricit
y generation and natural gas procurement for core customers. The Utility’s risk management activities include the use ofphysical and financial 
instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps, options, and other instruments and agreements. As long as the Utility can concludethat it is probable that it
s reasonably incurred wholesale electricity procurement costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and naturalgas prices will not affe
ct earnings. Such fluctuations, however, may impact cash flows. The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core customersare also fully recoverable thr
ough a ratemaking mechanism.82

The Utility’s current authorized revenue requirement for natural gas transportation and storage service to non-core customers is not balancing account protected. The Utility recovers thes
e costs in its gas transmission and storage rate cases through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts,resulting in price and volu
metric risk. The Utility uses value-at-risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks. The Utility’s value-at-risk wasapproximately 
$11 million and $8 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8. for further discussion of pr
ice risk management activities.)Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk s
ensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in marketinterest rates. At 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 , if interest rates changed by 1% for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term debt, short-term debt,and cash investments, the i
mpact on net income over the next 12 months would be $24 million and $12 million, respectiv ely, based on net variable rate debt andother interest rat
e-sensitive instruments outstanding. (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. for further discussion of interestrates.)
Energy Procurement Credit Risk
The Utility conducts business with coun
terparties mainly in the energy industry, including the CAISO market, other California investor-owned electric utilities,municipal utiliti
es, energy trading companies, financial institutions, electricity generation companies, and oil and natural gas production companies located in theUnited States and Canada. If a coun
terparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas, then the Utility may find it necessary toprocure electricity or gas at c
urrent market prices, which may be higher than the contract prices.The Utility manages cred
it risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, creditratings, and other credit
 criteria as deemed appropriate. Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically. The Utility executes many energy contractsunder master commodity ena
bling agreements that may require security (referred to as “Credit Collateral” in the table below). Credit collateral may be in the formof cash or letters of credit
. The Utility may accept other forms of performance assurance in the form of corporate guarantees of acceptable credit quality or othereligible securities (as deemed a
ppropriate by the Utility). Credit collateral or performance assurance may be required from counterparties when current netreceivables and replacement cost
 exposure exceed contractually specified limits.The following table summar

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe preparation of the Consolid
ated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recordedamounts of assets and liabi
lities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Theaccounting policies desc
ribed below are considered to be critical accounting policies due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant andmaterial to the f
inancial position and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the use of material judgmentsand estimates. Actual res
ults may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. These accounting policies and their key characteristics are outlinedbelow.
Loss Contingencies
As discussed below, PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty have recorded material accruals for various wildfire-related, enforcement and legal matters, andenvironmental remediation liabilities
. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded insurance receivables for third-party claims.Wildfire-Related liabilities
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to potential liabilities related to wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a wildfire-related liability whenit determines that 
a loss is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of losses. The provision is based on the lower end of the range, unless anamount within the range is a b
etter estimate than any other amount. Potential liabilit
ies related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires depend on various factors, including but not limited to the cause of eachfire, contributing caus
es of the fires (including alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged ordestroyed, the contents of such s
tructures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants,the nature and extent of 
any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs,other damages the Utili
ty may be responsible for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities. Thereare a number of unknown facts and 
legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims thatmay be asserted against PG&E Corpor
ation or the Utility, the number of wildfire-related claims that will be filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, the number of currentand future claims tha
t will be included in a plan of reorganization, how claims for punitive damages and claims by variously situated persons will be treated andwhether such claims 
will be allowed, and the impact that historical settlement values for wildfire claims may have on the estimation of wildfire liability in theChapter 11 Cases.
The process for estimatin
g wildfire-related liabilities requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjectivefactors, including but not l
imited to factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires.  (See Note13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements in Item 8.)84

Enforcement and Litigation MattersPG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims andlawsuits. In addition, penalt
ies may be incurred for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility record aprovision for a loss contingency when 
it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. PG&E Corporationand the Utility evaluat
e the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is abetter estimate 
than any other amount. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable,often involves a series of 
complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of allknown information, such as negotia
tions, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to aparticular matt
er. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs, which are expensed as incurred. Actualresults may differ m
aterially from these estimates and assumptions. (See Note 13 and “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 14 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.)Environmental Remediation Liabiliti
esThe Utility is subject to loss 
contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the Utility to payfor environmental re
mediation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party. Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardoussubstances at various potent
ial sites, including former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility for thestorage, recycling, or dispos
al of potentially hazardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site.The Utility generally comme
nces the environmental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a potentialsite requiring remedial action.
 (In some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determine its remediation liability for sites that it no longer owns in cooperationwith regulatory agencies. For 
example, the Utility has begun a program related to certain former manufactured gas plant sites.) Based on such notification, theUtility completes an ass
essment of the potential site and evaluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred. The Utility records anenvironmental remed
iation liability when site assessments indicate remediation is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of possible losses.Given the complexities of 
the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process forestimating remedi
ation liabilities is subjective and requires significant judgment. Key factors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extent and types ofhazardous substances at a pot
ential site, the range of technologies that can be used for remediation, the determination of the Utility’s liability in proportion to otherresponsible parties, and th
e extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.When possible, the Utility es
timates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites depending onthe level of informa
tion available. Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees who areexpected to devote a si
gnificant amount of time directly to the remediation effort. These estimated costs include remedial site investigations, remediation actions,operations and maintenance
 activities, post remediation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site.Remediation efforts fo
r a particular site generally extend over a period of several years. During this period, the laws governing the remediation process maychange, as well as site condi
tions, thereby possibly affecting the cost of the remediation effort.85

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Utility’s accruals for undiscounted gross environmental liabilities were $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.0 billion, respectively. TheUtility’s undiscounted futur
e costs could increase to as much as $ 2.5 billion if the extent of contaminatio n or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or ifthe other potentially 
responsible parties are not financially able to contribute to these costs, and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyondregulatory requirem
ents. Although the Utility has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, estimated costs mayvary significantly fro
m actual costs, and the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.Insurance Receivable
The Utility has liabili
ty insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party claims. The Utility records insurance recoveries only when athird-party claim 
is recorded and it is deemed probable that a recovery of that claim will occur and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.  Theassessment of whether recov
ery is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the recovery or a range of recoveries is estimable, often involves a series ofcomplex judgments abo
ut future events.  Insurance recoveries are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information,including contractual 
liability insurance policy coverage, advice of legal counsel, past experience with similar events, discussions with insurers and otherinformation and events pe
rtaining to a particular matter. (See "Loss Recoveries" in Note 13 and “Other Matters” in Note 14 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8.)Regulatory Accounting
As a regulated entity, the Ut
ility records regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers. Despitethe ongoing losses related to wi
ldfires (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), there is no actual or anticipated change in the cost ofservice regulation of 
the Utility’s operations. Therefore, the Utility continues to apply the accounting ASC 980, Regulated
Operations
 . These amounts would otherwise be recorded to exp
ense or income under GAAP. Refer to “Regulation and Regulated Operations” in Note 2 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8. At December 31, 2018 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility repo rted regulatory assets (including current regulatorybalancing accounts rec
eivable) of $6.6 billion and regulatory liabil ities (including current regulatory balancing accounts payable) of $10.1 billion . 86

Determining probability requires significant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatoryhearings, proposed regulatory d
ecisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. For some of theUtility’s regulatory asset
s, including utility retained generation, the Utility has determined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from theCPUC. The Utility also records a regula
tory asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that recovery ofincurred costs is probable, su
ch as the regulatory assets for pension benefits; deferred income tax; price risk management; and unamortized loss, net of gain, onreacquired debt. The CPUC has not denied th
e recovery of any material costs previously recognized by the Utility as regulatory assets for the periods presented. Ifthe Utility determin
ed that it is no longer probable that regulatory assets would be recovered or reflected in future rates, or if the Utility ceased to be subject to rateregulation, the regula
tory assets would be charged against income in the period in which that determination was made. If regulatory accounting did not apply, theUtility’s future financial res
ults could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the differences in the timing of expense or revenuerecognition.
A portion of the Utility's regul
atory asset balances relate to items which could not be anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests resulting fromcatastrophic events, ch
anges in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in amemorandum account and th
e CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incremental and prudentlyincurred. These accounts, which 
include the CEMA, WEMA, and FHPMA, among others, allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work related todisaster and wildfire r
esponse, and other wildfire prevention-related costs. While the Utility believes such costs are recoverable, rate recovery requires CPUCauthorization in separ
ate proceedings or through a GRC. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account”, “RegulatoryMatters - Catastrophic Exp
ense Memorandum Account”, and “Regulatory Matters - Fire Hazard Prevention Memorandum Account” in Item 7. MD&A.)Additionally, SB 901 provides a mechanis
m for the CPUC to potentially allow recovery in future rates, through a securitization mechanism, of wildfire-relatedcosts found to be just and reasonab
le by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold.Through December 31, 2018, the Utility h
as incurred net wildfire-related claims for the 2017 Northern California wildfires in excess of $2.7 billion. The Utility hasmade an assessment as of Dec
ember 31, 2018 and has concluded that the net wildfire-related claims do not meet the criteria for recognition as a regulatory asset.The Utility must evaluate
 the likelihood of recovery in future rates each period. If the criteria are met at a later date, the Utility would recognize a regulatory assetand a related gain in th
e consolidated income statement in the period in which it is determined that the likelihood of recovery is probable.  
In addition, regulatory a
ccounting standards require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemakingpurposes and if a reasonable 
estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments require significant judgment by management regardingprobability of recovery, 
as described above, and the ultimate cost of construction of capital assets. The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are expectedto exceed the amount to be 
recovered.  The Utility’s capital forecasts involve a series of complex judgments regarding detailed project plans, estimates included inthird-party contracts, hist
orical cost experience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmental compliance standards, and a variety of other factors. Asset Retirement Obligations
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ac
count for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair valueand its settlement da
te can be made. At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of therelated long-lived ass
et. The Utility recognizes a regulatory asset or liability for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs recoveredthrough the ratemaking pro
cess. (See Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)To estimate its liab
ility, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant estimates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs,inflation rates, and the e
stimated date of decommissioning. The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the riskassociated with the decom
missioning obligation.87

At December 31, 2018, the Utility’s recorded ARO for the estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was approximately $6 billion . Changes in these estimates and assumptions 
could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefi
t PlansPG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non
-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees as well as contributory postretirement healthcare and medical plans for eli
gible retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees andretirees. Adjustments to 
the pension and other benefit obligation are based on the differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results. These amountsare deferred in ac
cumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into income on a gradual basis. The differences between pension benefit expenserecognized in accordan
ce with GAAP and amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities as amounts are probable ofrecovery from custome
rs. To the extent the other benefits are in an overfunded position, the Utility records a regulatory liability. (See Note 3 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.)The pension and 
other postretirement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date. The significant actuarialassumptions used in determin
ing pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the health carecost trend rate and the 
expected return on plan assets. PG&E Corporation and the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.While PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience, plan changes oramendments, or significant
 changes in assumptions may materially affect the recorded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future planexpenses. (See Note 11 of the Notes to th
e Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)In establishing health c
are cost assumptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider recent cost trends and projections from industry experts. This evaluationsuggests that current ra
tes of inflation are expected to continue in the near term. In recognition of continued high inflation in health care costs and given the designof PG&E Corporation’s plans, the assumed h
ealth care cost trend rate for 2019 is 6.5%, gradually decreasing to the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% in 2027 and beyond.Expected rates of retu
rn on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations ofthe employee benefit 
trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets. Fixed-income returns were projected based on real maturity and creditspreads added to a long-ter
m inflation rate. Equity returns were projected based on estimates of dividend yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term rateof inflation. For the Utili
ty’s defined benefit pension plan, the assumed return of 6.0% compares to a ten-year actual return of 10.0%.The rate used to discount pension b
enefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of approximately 1,101 Aa-grade non-callablebonds at December 31, 2018. This yield cu
rve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations. The estimated future cash flows for the pensionand other postretirem
ent benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.The following reflects th

This report contains f

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PR
ESENTATIONOrganization and Basis of Presentation
PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose pri
mary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and centralCalifornia. The Utility gen
erates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers. The Utility is primarily regulated by theCPUC and the FERC. In addition, the NRC oversees the licensing, cons
truction, operation, and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.This is a combined annual repo
rt of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of PG&ECorporation, the Utility, and oth
er wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries. The Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Utilityand its wholly owned and controlled subsid
iaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements apply to both PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess financial performance and allocate re sources on aconsolidated basis (i.e., th
e companies operate in one segment).The accompanying Consolidated Finan
cial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the reporting requirements of Form10-K. The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,liabilities, revenu
es and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to theUtility’s wildfire-related liabilities
, legal and regulatory contingencies, environmental remediation liabilities, insurance receivables, regulatory assets and liabilities,AROs, and pension and other postretirem
ent benefit plans obligations. Management believes that its estimates and assumptions reflected in the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements are ap
propriate and reasonable. A change in management’s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that could have a materialeffect on PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows during the period in which such changeoccurred.
Chapter 11 Filing and Going Concern
The accompanying Consolidated Finan
cial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of operations, therealization of asse
ts and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, as a result of the challenges that are further described below, suchrealization of asse
ts and satisfaction of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are facing extraordinary challenges relating to aseries of catastrophi
c wildfires that occurred in Northern California in 2017 and 2018.  See Note 13 below. Uncertainty regarding these matters raises substantialdoubt about PG&E Corporation's and the Utili
ty's abilities to continue as going concerns.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have determined that commencingreorganization cases und
er Chapter 11 is necessary to restore PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's financial stability to fund ongoing operations and provide safeservice to customers. However, 
there can be no assurance that such proceedings will restore PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's financial stability.  On thePetition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court.  See Note 15 below.  TheConsolidated Financial State
ments do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should PG&E Corporation and the Utility be unable to continue asgoing concerns. 
Pursuant to Chapter 11, PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility retain control of their assets and are authorized to operate their business as debtors in possession whilebeing subject to the jurisd
iction of the Bankruptcy Court. While operating as debtors in possession under Chapter 11, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may sellor otherwise dispose of or liquid
ate assets or settle liabilities, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court or as otherwise permitted in the ordinary course ofbusiness and subject to restr
ictions in PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's DIP Credit Agreement (see Note 4 and Note 15 below) and applicable orders of theBankruptcy Court, for amounts other 
than those reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  Any such actions occurring during the Chapter11 Cases confirmed by the Bankruptcy Cour
t could materially impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities reported in PG&E Corporation's andthe Utility's Consolidated Financ
ial Statements.108

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESLoss Contingencies
A provision for a loss contingency is 
recorded when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can reasonably beestimated. PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility evaluate which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonably estimated losses and record acharge that refle
cts their best estimate or the lower end of the range, if there is no better estimate. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonablypossible, and whether the loss or a 
range of losses is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewedquarterly and estima
tes are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice oflegal counsel, and other in
formation and events pertaining to a particular matter. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludesanticipated legal 
costs, which are expensed as incurred.Regulation and Regulated Operations
The Utility follows
 accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorizedby the CPUC or the FERC based on the Utility’s cost of provid
ing service.  The Utility’s ability to recover a significant portion of its authorized revenuerequirements through ra
tes is generally independent, or “decoupled,” from the volume of the Utility’s electricity and natural gas sales.  The Utility records assetsand liabilities tha
t result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities.  The Utility capitalizes andrecords, as regulatory ass
ets, costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.  Regulatoryassets are amortiz
ed over the future periods in which the costs are recovered.  If costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered throughrates, the Utility re
cords those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities.  Amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers in the future arealso recorded as regula
tory liabilities.The Utility also record
s a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that areprobable of recovery or r
efund.  In addition, the Utility records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between incurred costs and customerbillings or authorized r
evenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differences are probable of recovery or refund.  These differences have noimpact on net income.  See 
“Revenue Recognition” below.Management continues to be
lieve the use of regulatory accounting is applicable and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable.  To theextent that portions of th
e Utility’s operations cease to be subject to cost of service rate regulation, or recovery is no longer probable as a result of changes inregulation or other re
asons, the related regulatory assets and liabilities are written off.Revenue Recognition
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Utility recognizes r
evenues when electricity and natural gas services are delivered.  The Utility records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energydelivered to customers bu
t not yet billed at the end of the period.  Unbilled revenues are included in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Ratescharged to customers ar
e based on CPUC and FERC authorized revenue requirements. Revenues can vary significantly from period to period because ofseasonality, weather, and cus
tomer usage patterns.The FERC authorizes the Utility’s r
evenue requirements in periodic TO rate cases.  The Utility’s ability to recover revenue requirements authorized by the FERCis dependent on the volume of th
e Utility’s electricity sales, and revenue is recognized only for amounts billed and unbilled, net of a reserve for revenues subject torefund.
Regulatory Balancing Account Revenue
The CPUC authorizes most of the Utility
’s revenues in the Utility’s GRC and its GT&S rate cases, which generally occur every three or four years.  The Utilityrecognizes revenues that 
have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and are expected to be collected within  24 months 
.  Generally, electri c and natural gas operating revenue is recognized ratably over the year.109

The CPUC also has authorized the Utility to collect additional revenue requirements to recover costs that the Utility has been authorized to pass on to customers,including costs to purchase e
lectricity and natural gas, and to fund public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs.  In general, therevenue recognition cr
iteria for pass-through costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred. The Utility records a regulatory balancing accountasset or liability fo
r differences between incurred costs and customer billings or authorized revenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differencesare probable of recove
ry or refund. As a result, these differences have no impact on net income.The following table presents

These amounts represent revenues authorized to be billed or refunded to customers.Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist o
f cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated atfair value. 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable
PG&E Corporatio
n and the Utility recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts to record uncollectable customer accounts receivable at estimated net realizablevalue.  The allowance is det
ermined based upon a variety of factors, including historical write-off experience, aging of receivables, current economic conditions,and assessment of customer 
collectability.110

InventoriesInventories are car
ried at weighted-average cost and include natural gas stored underground as well as materials and supplies.  Natural gas stored underground isrecorded to inventory when inj
ected and then expensed as the gas is withdrawn for distribution to customers or to be used as fuel for electric generation.  Materialsand supplies are recorded 
to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when consumed or installed.Emission Allowances
The Utility purchases GHG emission al
lowances to satisfy its compliance obligations.  Associated costs are recorded as inventory and included in current assets –other and other noncurrent 
assets – other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Costs are carried at weighted-average and are recoverable through rates.Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment 
are reported at the lower of their historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value.  Historical costs include labor andmaterials, construc
tion overhead, and AFUDC.  (See “AFUDC” below.)  The Utility’s total estimated useful lives and balances of its property, plant, andequipment were as follows:

     (1) Balance includes nuclear fuel inventories.  Stored nuclear fuel inventory is stated at weighted-average cost.  Nuclear fuel in the reactor is expensed as it is used based on the amount of energyoutput.  (See Note 14 below.)
The Utility depreciat
es property, plant, and equipment using the composite, or group, method of depreciation, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to thegross investment balance 
in a particular class of property.  This method approximates the straight line method of depreciation over the useful lives of property,plant, and equipment.  The Util
ity’s composite depreciation rates were 3.82% in 2018 , 3.83% in 2017 , and 3.73% in 2016 .  The useful lives of the Util ity’sproperty, plant, and equipmen
t are authorized by the CPUC and the FERC, and the depreciation expense is recovered through rates charged to customers. Depreciation expense inc
ludes a component for the original cost of assets and a component for estimated cost of future removal, net of any salvage value atretirement.  Upon reti
rement, the original cost of the retired assets, net of salvage value, is charged against accumulated depreciation.  The cost of repairs andmaintenance, including pla
nned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of property, is charged to operating and maintenance expense as incurred.AFUDC
AFUDC represents the estimated costs o
f debt (i.e., interest) and equity funds used to finance regulated plant additions before they go into service and iscapitalized as par
t of the cost of construction.  AFUDC is recoverable from customers through rates over the life of the related property once the property is placedin service.  AFUDC related to the cost o
f debt is recorded as a reduction to interest expense.  AFUDC related to the cost of equity is recorded in other income.  TheUtility recorded AFUDC related to deb
t and equity, respectively, of $ 53 million and $ 129 million during 2018 , $38 million and $89 million during 2017 , and $51 
million and $112 million during 2016 . 111

211  207 Liabilities settled
(109 ) (120 )ARO liability at end of year
$ 5,994  $4,899 The Utility has not recorded 
a liability related to certain AROs for assets that are expected to operate in perpetuity.  As the Utility cannot estimate a settlement dateor range of potential se
ttlement dates for these assets, reasonable estimates of fair value cannot be made.  As such, ARO liabilities are not recorded for retirementactivities associated with 
substations, photovoltaic facilities, and certain hydroelectric facilities; removal of lead-based paint in some facilities and certaincommunications equipmen
t from leased property; and restoration of land to the conditions under certain agreements. Nuclear Decommissioning Obligation
Detailed studies of the cos
t to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities are generally conducted every three years in conjunction with the NuclearDecommissioning Cost Triennial Pro
ceeding conducted by the CPUC.  In December 2018, the Utility submitted its updated decommissioning cost estimate to theCPUC and correspondingly increased its ARO liabi
lities by $1.1 billion .  The adjustment was a result o f increased estimated costs based on a site-specificdecommissioning analysis.  The d
ecommissioning cost estimates are based on the plant location and cost characteristics for the Utility's nuclear power plants. Actual decommissioning costs 
may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulatory requirements;technology; and costs of labor, 
materials, and equipment.  The Utility recovers its revenue requirements for decommissioning costs from customers through a non-bypassable charge that th
e Utility expects will continue until those costs are fully recovered.The total nuclear deco
mmissioning obligation accrued was $4.7 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.  The esti mated undiscountednuclear decommissioning 
cost for the Utility’s nuclear power plants was $10.6 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Disallowance of Plant Costs
PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently completed plant will not berecoverable through ra
tes charged to customers and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.  See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 14below.
Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts
The Utility’s nuclear ge
neration facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and one retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires thesafe removal of a nuclear ge
neration facility from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license andrelease of the proper
ty for unrestricted use.  The Utility's nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered from customers through rates and are held in trusts untilauthorized for rele
ase by the CPUC. The Utility classifies 
its debt investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts as available-for-sale. Since the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning trust assetsare managed by externa
l investment managers, the Utility does not have the ability to sell its investments at its discretion.  Therefore, all unrealized losses areconsidered other-than-temporar
y impairments. Gains or losses on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments are refundable or recoverable, respectively, fromcustomers through rates.  The
refore, trust earnings are deferred and included in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of the ARO.  There is no impact onthe Utility’s earnings or 
accumulated other comprehensive income.  The cost of debt and equity securities sold by the trust is determined by specific identification.112

Variable Interest EntitiesA VIE is an entity that does not have su
fficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or whoseequity investors lack a
ny characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is a primary beneficiaryand is required to consolida
te the VIE.  Some of the counterparti
es to the Utility’s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power plant that wouldgenerate electricity for sale to the
 Utility.  To determine whether the Utility was the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2018 , it assessed whether it absorbs any of the VIE’s 
expected losses or receives any portion of the VIE’s expected residual returns under the terms of the power purchaseagreement, analyzed 
the variability in the VIE’s gross margin, and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities that are mostsignificant to the VIE’s pe
rformance, such as dispatch rights and operating and maintenance activities.  The Utility’s financial obligation is limited to the amountthe Utility pays for deliv
ered electricity and capacity.  The Utility did not have any decision-making rights associated with any of the activities that are mostsignificant to the econo
mic performance of any of these VIEs.  Since the Utility was not the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2018 , it did not consolidate any of them.

Revenue Recognition Standard
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-9,  
Revenue
from
Contracts
with
Customers
(Topic
606)
 , which amends the previous revenu e recognitionguidance.  The objective of 
the new standard is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improvecomparability across entities,
 industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets and to provide more useful information to users of financial statements throughimproved and expanded disclosur
e requirements.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility applied the requirements using the modified retrospective method when theASU became effective on Janua
ry 1, 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of theadoption date or for the ye
ar ended December 31, 2018. A majority of the Utility’s revenue from contracts with customers continues to be recognized on a monthlybasis based on applicable t
ariffs and customers' monthly consumption. Such revenue is recognized using the invoice practical expedient which allows an entity torecognize revenue in th
e amount that directly corresponds to the value transferred to the customer. See "Revenue Recognition" above.Restricted Cash
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,  
Statement
of
Cash
Flows
–
Restricted
Cash
(Topic
230)
 , which amends the existing guidan ce relating tothe disclosure of restr
icted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. Amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cashequivalents should be included wi
th cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end of period total amounts shown on the statement of cashflows.  Previously, changes in restr
icted cash were reported within cash flows from investing activities. PG&E Corporation and the Utility applied the requirementson a retrospective basis when 
the ASU became effective on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements as o
f the adoption date or for the year ended December 31, 2018.The retrospective adjus
tments to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for PG&E Corporation and the Utility resulted in an increase to Net cash used ininvesting activities of 
$227 million, an increase to Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at January 1 by $234 million, and an increas e to Cash, cashequivalents and restri
cted cash at December 31 by $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.Presentation of Net Periodic Pension and Post-Retir
ement Benefit CostsIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07,  
Compensation
–
Retirement
Benefits
(Topi c
715)
, which amends the guidance re lating to the presentation ofnet periodic pension cost and n
et periodic other post-retirement benefit costs.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility applied the requirements when the ASU becameeffective on January 1, 2018.
114

On a retrospective basis, the amendment requires an employer to separate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost and providesexplicit guidance on how to pres
ent the service cost component and other components in the income statement.  As a result, the Consolidated Statements of Incomefor PG&E Corporation and the Utility we
re restated. This change resulted in increases to Operating and maintenance expenses and Other income, net, of $51 million 
and  $54 million for PG&E Corporation and the Utility, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $97 million and $100 million for PG&E Corporation and the Utility, r
espectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.On a prospective basis, the ASU limits 
the component of net benefit cost eligible to be capitalized to service costs. The FERC has allowed and the Utility has madea one-time elect
ion to adopt the new FASB guidance for regulatory filing purposes.  In January 2018, the CPUC approved modifications to the Utility’s calculationfor pension-related revenue
 requirements to allow for capitalization of only the service cost component determined by a plan’s actuary. The capitalization ofservice costs only results 
in higher rate base and a reduction in the Utility’s 2018 revenues.  The changes in capitalization of retirement benefits did not have amaterial impac
t on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements.Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilit

ents (excluding those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation) to be measured at fair value, with changesin fair value recogni
zed in net income.  The majority of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investments are held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts andgains or losses are refundab
le or recoverable, respectively, from customers through rates, therefore gains and losses are deferred and recognized as regulatoryassets or liabiliti
es.  The ASU became effective for PG&E Corporation and the Utility on January 1, 2018 and did not have a material impact on the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements and 
related disclosures.Reclassification of Certain Tax Effec

Recognition of Lease Assets and Liabilities
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  
Leases
(Topic

 , which amends the guidance re lating to the definition of a lease, recognition of ROUassets and lease liabi
lities on the balance sheet, and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements.  Under the new standard, all lessees mustrecognize an ROU asset and lease 
liability on the balance sheet. Operating leases were previously not recognized on the balance sheet.  The ASU became effectivefor PG&E Corporation and the Utility on J
anuary 1, 2019.PG&E Corporation and the Utility el
ected certain practical expedients and will carry forward historical conclusions related to (1) contracts that contain leases, (2)existing lease and ease
ment classification, and (3) initial direct costs. Additionally, PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not intend to restate comparative periodsupon adoption.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility plan 
to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2019. PG&E Corporation and the Utility will apply the requirements using themodified retrospect
ive method. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect this standard to increase ROU assets and liabilities by approximately $2.5 billion to $3.0billion 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and will result in additional footnote disclosures, but do not expect the guidance will have a material impact on theConsolidated Statements of In
come and Statements of Cash Flows. The majority of PG&E Corporation and the Utility's leases are power purchase agreements.115

$ 4,964  $3,793    
     (1) Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annual contribution requirements. As these annual requirements continue indefinitely into the future, the Utility expects tocontinuously recover pension benefits.
(2) 
In connection with the settlement agreement entered into among PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the CPUC in 2003 to resolve the Utility’s 2001 proceeding under Chapter 11, the CPUCauthorized the Utility to recover 
$1.2 billion of costs related to the Utility’s retained generation assets.  The individua l components of these regulatory assets are being amortized over therespective lives of the underlying generation facilities, consistent wi
th the period over which the related revenues are recognized. (3) 
Includes costs of responding to catastrophic events that have been declared a disaster or state of emergency by competent federal or state authorities. Recovery of CEMA costs are subject toCPUC review and approval.
(4) 
Includes specific incremental wildfire liability costs the CPUC approved for tracking in June 2018. Recovery of WEMA costs are subject to CPUC review and approval.(5) 
Includes costs associated with the implementation of regulations and requirements adopted to protect the public from potential fire hazards associated with overhead power line facilities andnearby aerial communication facilities that have not been previous
ly authorized in another proceeding. Recovery of FHPMA costs are subject to CPUC review and approval.In general, regulatory 
assets represent the cumulative differences between amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes and expense or accumulated othercomprehensive income (
loss) recognized in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, the Utility does not earn a return on regulatory assets if the related costs do notaccrue interest.  Acco
rdingly, the Utility earns a return on its regulatory assets for retained generation, and regulatory assets for unamortized loss, net of gain, onreacquired debt.

Represents the net of amounts owed to customers for deferred taxes collected at higher rates before the Tax Act and amounts owed to the Utility for reversal of deferred taxes subject to flow- through treatment. (See Note 8 below.)
(3) 
Represents the cumulative differences between ARO expenses and amounts collected in rates.  Decommissioning costs related to the Utility’s nuclear facilities are recovered through rates andare placed in nuclear decommissioning trusts.  This regulatory liabil
ity also represents the deferral of realized and unrealized gains and losses on these nuclear decommissioning trustinvestments.  (See Note 10 below.)
(4) 
Represents amounts received from customers designated for public purpose program costs expected to be incurred beyond the next 12 months, primarily related to energy efficiency programs.(5) 
Represents cumulative differences between incurred costs and amounts collected in rates for Post-Retirement Medical, Post-Retirement Life and Long Term Disability Plans.Regulatory Balancing Accounts
The Utility tracks (1) 
differences between the Utility’s authorized revenue requirement and customer billings, and (2) differences between incurred costs andcustomer billings.  To the ex
tent these differences are probable of recovery or refund over the next 12 months , the Utility records a  current regulatory balancingaccount receivable o
r payable.  Regulatory balancing accounts that the Utility expects to collect or refund over a period exceeding 12 months are recorded as other noncurrent assets – regula
tory assets or noncurrent liabilities – regulatory liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These differences do nothave an impact on net inco
me.  Balancing accounts will fluctuate during the year based on seasonal electric and gas usage and the timing of when costs areincurred and customer r
evenues are collected. Current regulatory balan

Debtor In Possession ("DIP") Facilities
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cas
es, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into a Senior Secured Superpriority Debtor in Possession Credit, Guaranty andSecurity Agreement, dated 
as of February 1, 2019 (the “DIP Credit Agreement”), among the Utility, as borrower, PG&E Corporation, as guarantor, JPMorganChase Bank, N.A., as administrative agen
t, Citibank, N.A., as collateral agent, and the lenders and issuing banks party thereto (together with such other financialinstitutions from tim
e to time party thereto, the "DIP Lenders"). The DIP Credit Agreement provides for $5.5 billion in senior secured sup erpriority debtor inpossession credit facilities
 in the form of (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $3.5 billion (the “DIP Revolving Facil ity”), including a $1.5 billion letter of credit subfacilit
y, (ii) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion (the “DIP Initia l Term Loan Facility”) and (iii) a delayeddraw term loan facil
ity in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the “DIP Delayed Draw Te rm Loan Facility”, together with the DIP Revolving Facilityand the DIP Initial Term Loan Fa
cility, the “DIP Facilities”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein.On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility filed a motion seeking, among other things, interim and final approval of the DIP Facilities, which motionwas granted on an interim bas
is by the Bankruptcy Court following a hearing on January 31, 2019. As a result of the Bankruptcy Court’s interim approval of theDIP Facilities and the satis
faction of the other conditions thereof, the DIP Credit Agreement became effective on February 1, 2019 and a portion of the DIPRevolving Facility in the amoun
t of $1.5 billion (including $750 million of the lett er of credit subfacility) was made available to PG&E Corporation and theUtility. As of February 28, 2019, the rem
ainder of the DIP Revolving Facility (including the remainder of the $1.5 billion letter of credit subfacilit y), the DIPInitial Term Loan Faci
lity and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility are unavailable for borrowing and will remain unavailable until and unless theBankruptcy Court approves the avai
lability thereof following a final hearing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the date of the final hearing,but it is currently schedu
led for March 13, 2019. There can be no assurances that the Bankruptcy Court will grant final approval of the DIP Facilities at the finalhearing, or at all.
Borrowings under the DIP Facilities a
re senior secured obligations of the Utility, secured by substantially all of the Utility’s assets and entitled to superpriorityadministrative expens
e claim status in the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case. The Utility’s obligations under the DIP Facilities are guaranteed by PG&E Corporation, andsuch guarantee is a senior s
ecured obligation of PG&E Corporation, secured by substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s assets and entitled to superpriorityadministrative expens
e claim status in PG&E Corporation’s Chapter 11 Case.119

The DIP Facilities mature on December 31, 2020, subject to the Utility’s option to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain terms and conditions aresatisfied, including the p
ayment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the then-outstanding loans and available commitments. Borrowings under the DIP Facilitieswill bear interest bas
ed, at the Utility’s election, on (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin or (2) ABR plus an applicable margin. ABR will equal the highest of thefollowing: (i) the admin
istrative agent’s announced base rate, (ii) 0.50% above the (x) federal funds effective rate or (y) the overnight federal funds rate, whicheveris higher, (iii) one-mon
th LIBOR plus 1.00% and (iv) zero . With respect to the DIP Revolving Fa cility, the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP DelayedDraw Term Loan Facility, the app
licable margin is 2.25% for LIBOR loans and 1.25% for ABR loans. The Utility is also requir
ed to pay unused fees of (i) 0.375% per annum in respect of th e average daily unutilized commitments under the DIP Revolving Facilityand (ii) 
1.125% per annum, which amount shall in crease to 2.25% per annum after six months, in respect of the average daily unutilized commitments under theDIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. The Ut
ility must also pay (x) a fee equal to the applicable margin with respect to LIBOR loans under the DIP RevolvingFacility on the aggregat
e drawable amount of all outstanding letters of credit under the DIP Revolving Facility and (y) a fronting fee to the relevant issuing DIPLender equal to 
0.125% per annum of the aggregat e drawable amount of outstanding letters of credit issued by such issuing DIP Lender.The DIP Credit Agreement includes usu
al and customary covenants for debtor in possession loan agreements of this type, including covenants limiting PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage inmergers, consolidations, sa
les of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions and make payments in respect of junior or pre-petition indebtedness, ineach case subject to cus
tomary exceptions for debtor in possession loan agreements of this type.The DIP Credit Agreement also inc
ludes customary and usual representations and warranties and affirmative covenants, including an obligation to deliver 13-weekcash flow forecasts and repo
rts showing variances from such forecasts, in each case on a rolling 4-week basis. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s obligationsunder the DIP Credit Agreement m
ay be accelerated following certain events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties,covenant defaults, cross-d
efaults to post-petition or unstayed indebtedness of PG&E Corporation and the Utility and their subsidiaries in excess of $200 million, certain events under ERISA, unstayed 
judgments in respect of post-petition obligations involving an aggregate liability in excess of $200 million, change of control, specified gover
nmental actions having a material adverse effect or condemnation or damage to a material portion of the collateral. Certain bankruptcy-related events are 
also events of default, including, but not limited to, the dismissal by the Bankruptcy Court of any of the Chapter 11 Cases, the conversion of anyof the Chapter 11 Cases to a case und
er chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, the appointment of a trustee pursuant to Chapter 11, any order authorizing the DIPFacilities being stayed, v
acated, reversed or amended in a manner adverse to the DIP Lenders, the final order approving the DIP Facilities failing to have beenentered by April 15, 2019, and cert
ain other events related to the impairment of the DIP Lenders’ rights or liens granted under the DIP Credit Agreement.The proceeds of the borrowings under 
the DIP Facilities will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and to pay fees, costs and expensesincurred in connection with 
the transactions contemplated by the DIP Credit Agreement and professional and other fees and costs of administration incurred inconnection with the Chapter 11 Cases.

    (1) On January 29, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility commenced reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constitutedan event of default or termination event under the above-referenced debt of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. With the exception of Pol
lution Control Bonds series 2008F and 2010E, wherea trustee notice is required to trigger acceleration, the commencement of the Chap
ter 11 Cases caused an automatic and immediate acceleration of such debt, and the possibility of cure isuncertain. Therefore, all long-term debt is classified as current as of 
December 31, 2018 . (2) 
At December 31, 2018 , the interest rate on the Term Loan was 3.66% . (3) 
Pollution Control Bonds series 2008F and 2010E were remarketed and issued in June 2017.  Although the stated maturity date for both series is 2026, these bonds have a mandatoryredemption date of May 31, 2022.  
(4) 
Each series of these bonds is supported by a separate direct-pay letter of credit. Subject to certain requirements, the Utility may choose not to provide a credit facility without issuer consent.Series 2009 A-B bonds have a maturity date of June 5, 2019.

Pollution Control BondsThe California Pollution Control Fin
ancing Authority and the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank have issued various series of fixed rateand multi-modal tax-
exempt pollution control bonds for the benefit of the Utility.  Substantially all of the net proceeds of the pollution control bonds were used tofinance or refinanc
e pollution control and sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at the Geysers geothermal power plant or at the Utility’s Diablo Canyonnuclear power plant.  In 1999, the Ut
ility sold all bond-financed facilities at the non-retired units of the Geysers geothermal power plant to Geysers PowerCompany, LLC pursuant to purchase and sales 
agreements stating that Geysers Power Company, LLC will use the bond-financed facilities solely as pollutioncontrol faciliti
es for so long as any tax-exempt pollution control bonds issued to finance the Geysers project are outstanding.  Except for components that may havebeen abandoned in place or dispos
ed of as scrap or that are permanently non-operational, the Utility has no knowledge that Geysers Power Company, LLC intendsto cease using the b
ond-financed facilities solely as pollution control facilities.Repayment Schedule

122

The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default or termination event, and caused an automatic and immediate acceleration of theAccelerated Direct Fin
ancial Obligations. However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations are automatically stayed as of the Petition Date, and aresubject to the applicab
le provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The material Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations include theoutstanding senior notes, agre
ements in respect of certain series of pollution control bonds, and PG&E Corporation's term loan facility, as well as short-termborrowings under PG&E Corporation's and the Util
ity's revolving credit facilities and the Utility's term loan facility. See Note 15 below for more information.Revolving Credit Facilities
In May 2017, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
each extended the termination dates of their existing revolving credit facilities by one year from April 27, 2021 to April 27, 2022.  As previously disclosed, PG&E Corporation's 
and the Utility's revolving credit facilities have been subject to an automatic and immediateacceleration as a 
result of the Chapter 11 Cases. Prior to the Chapter 11 Cases, proceeds from the revolving credit facilities were used for working capital, therepayment of commer
cial paper, and other corporate purposes.  
Borrowings under each credit ag
reement (other than swingline loans) previously bore interest based on the borrower’s credit rating and on each borrower’s electionof either (1) LIBOR plus an applic
able margin or (2) the base rate plus an applicable margin.  The base rate equaled the higher of the following: the administrativeagent’s announced base rat
e, 0.5% above the overnight feder al funds rate, and the one-month LIBOR plus an applicable margin.  The borrower’s credit rating atthe time of borrowing dete
rmined the applicable rate within the following ranges.  The applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranged between 0.9% and 1.475%under PG&E Corporation’s credit ag
reement and between 0.8% and 1.275% under the Utility’s cred it agreement.  The applicable margin for base rate loans rangedbetween 
0% and 0.475% under PG&E Corporation’s credit ag reement and between 0% and 0.275% under the Utility’s cred it agreement.  In addition, the facilityfee under PG&E Corporation’s and the Ut
ility’s credit agreements ranged between 0.1% and 0.275% and between 0.075% and 0.225% , respectively. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
revolving credit facilities include usual and customary provisions for revolving credit facilities of this type, including thoseregarding events of defau
lt and covenants limiting liens to those permitted under their senior note indentures, mergers, sales of all or substantially all of theirassets, and other fundament
al changes.  In addition, the respective revolving credit facilities required that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain a ratio oftotal consolidated debt t
o total consolidated capitalization of at most 65% as of the end of each fisc al quarter.  PG&E Corporation’s revolving credit facilityagreement also requi
red that PG&E Corporation own, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the outstanding common stock and at least 70% of the outstanding voting capital stock of th
e Utility.Commercial Paper Programs
The borrowings from PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s commercial paper programs were used primarily to fund temporary financing needs.  PG&ECorporation and the Utility cou
ld issue commercial paper up to the maximum amounts of $300 million and $2.5 billion , respectively. PG&E Corporation and theUtility treated the amount 
of outstanding commercial paper as a reduction to the amount available under their respective revolving credit facilities.  Thecommercial paper h
ad maturities up to 365 days and ranked equally with PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness. Commercial paper notes 
were sold at an interest rate dictated by the market at the time of issuance.  For 2018 , the average yield on outst anding PG&E Corporationand Utility commerci
al paper was 1.85% and 1.91% , respectively. Other Short-term Borrowings
In February 2018, the Utility’s 
$250 million floating rate unsecur ed term loan, issued in February 2017, matured and was repaid. In February 2018, the Utilityentered into a 
$250 million floating rate unsecur ed term loan. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of theUtility’s outstanding comm
ercial paper. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, repayment of this loan, which was scheduled to mature on February 22, 2019, hasbeen stayed.
As of 
December 31, 2018 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility ea ch had no commercial paper borrowings. PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not expect to beable to access the com
mercial paper market for the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases.In November 2018, the Utility's 
$500 million floating rate unsecur ed term loan, issued in November 2017, matured and was repaid.123

NOTE 5: COMMON STOCK AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONPG&E Corporation had 
520,338,710 shares of common stock outstand ing at December 31, 2018 .  PG&E Corporation held all of the Uti lity’s outstanding commonstock at 
December 31, 2018 . During 
2018 , PG&E Corporation sold no shares of common stock under the February 2017 EDA.In addition, during 
2018 , PG&E Corporation sold 5.6 million shares of common stock under its 401(k) plan, the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan,and share-based compensat
ion plans for total cash proceeds of $199 million. Beginning January 1, 2019 PG&E Corporat ion changed its default matchingcontributions under its 401(k) p
lan from PG&E common stock to cash.Dividends
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directo
rs of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s common stock, beginn
ing the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018,due to the uncertainty relate
d to the causes of and potential liabilities associated with wildfires. See Wildfire-related contingencies in Note 13 below.Under the Utility’s Articl
es of Incorporation, the Utility cannot pay common stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility’s preferredstock have been paid.  Under thei
r respective credit agreements, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are each required to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debtto consolidated capita
lization of at most 65% .  Based on the calculation of this ratio for each company,  no amount of PG&E Corporation's retained earnings and$1.4 billion 
of the Utility's retain ed earnings was subject to this restriction at December 31, 2018 .  Additionally, the Utility's ne t assets, and therefore its ability topay dividends, are restri
cted by the CPUC-authorized capital structure, which requires the Utility to maintain, on average, at least 52% equity.  Based on the calculation of this ratio,  
none of the Utility's net assets we re restricted at December 31, 2018 .  Additionally, as a result of this requirement, the Utility's ability topay dividends in the future cou
ld be impacted by future potential liabilities.  PG&E Corporation does not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeablefuture.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The PG&E Corporation LTIP permits various 
forms of share-based incentive awards, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares, and othershare-based awards, to elig
ible employees of PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries.  Non-employee directors of PG&E Corporation are also eligible to receivecertain share-based 
awards.  A maximum of 17 million shares of PG&E Corporation common stock (subject to certain adjustments) has been reserved for issuanceunder the 2014 LTIP, of which 
15,150,532 shares were available for future awards at December 31, 2018 . The following table provides a su
mmary of total share-based compensation expense recognized by PG&E Corporation for share-based incentive awards for 2018 : (in

Stock Options
The exercise price of s
tock options granted under the 2014 LTIP and all other outstanding stock options is equal to the market price of PG&E Corporation’scommon stock on the date of gr
ant.  Stock options generally have a 10 -year term and vest over four years of continuous service, subjec t to accelerated vesting incertain circumst
ances. As of December 31, 2018 , $1.5 million of total unre cognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options were expected to berecognized over a weighted 
average period of a year and a half for PG&E Corporation.124

The fair value of each stock option on the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation method.  The weighted average grant date fair value ofoptions granted using the Black-Scho
les valuation method was $10.24 per share in 2018 .  The significant assumptions us ed for shares granted in 2018 were:  
2018 Expected stock price vola

ent3.10 %Risk-free interest rate
2.58 %Expected life (years)
6 Expected volatiliti
es are based on historical volatility of PG&E Corporation’s common stock.  The expected dividend payment is the dividend yield at the date ofgrant.  The risk-free in
terest rate for periods within the contractual term of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury rates in effect at the date of grant.  Theexpected life of stock o
ptions is derived from historical data that estimates stock option exercises and employee departure behavior.There was no tax benefit re
cognized from stock options for the year ended December 31, 2018 . The following table summar

       Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock units gran
ted after 2014 generally vest equally over three years . Vested restricted stock un its are settled in shares of PG&E Corporation commonstock accompanied by cash pay
ments to settle any dividend equivalents associated with the vested restricted stock units.  Compensation expense is generallyrecognized ratably ove
r the vesting period based on grant-date fair value.  The weighted average grant-date fair value for restricted stock units granted during 2018 , 
2017 , and 2016 was $40.92 , $66.95 , and $56.68 , respectively.  The tota l fair value of restricted stock units that vested during 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 was $41million, $ 
57 million, and $ 36 million, respectively.  The tax benefit from restricted stock units that vested during each period was not material.  In general,forfeitures are r
ecorded ratably over the vesting period, using historical averages and adjusted to actuals when vesting occurs.  As of December 31, 2018 , $43million of total unre
cognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units was expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted averageperiod of 
1.79 years. The following table summar

Performance SharesPerformance shares gene
rally will vest three years after the gran t date.  Upon vesting, performance shares are settled in shares of common stock based on eitherPG&E Corporation’s total sharehold
er return relative to a specified group of industry peer companies over a three -year performance p eriod or, for a small numberof awards, an internal PG&E Corporat
ion metric.  Dividend equivalents are paid in cash based on the amount of common stock to which the recipients are entitled. Compensation expen
se attributable to performance share is generally recognized ratably over the applicable three -year period based on the gr ant-date fair valuedetermined using a Monte Car
lo simulation valuation model for the total shareholder return based awards or the grant-date market value of PG&E Corporationcommon stock for internal
 metric based awards.  The weighted average grant-date fair value for performance shares granted during 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 was $36.92 
, $77.00 , and $53.61 respectively.  There was no tax benefit associated with performance shares during each of these periods.  In general, forfeitures arerecorded ratably over 
the vesting period, using historical averages and adjusted to actuals when vesting occurs.  As of December 31, 2018 , $31 million of totalunrecognized compensation 
costs related to nonvested performance shares was expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 1.68 years.

NOTE 6: PREFERRED STOCK
PG&E Corporation has authorized 
80 million shares of no par value preferred stock and 5 million shares of $100 par value preferred s tock, which may be issued asredeemable or nonrede
emable preferred stock.  PG&E Corporation does not have any preferred stock outstanding.The Utility has authorized 
75 million shares of $25 par value preferred stock and 10 million shares of $100 par value preferred s tock.  At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 
, the Utility’s prefer red stock outstanding included $145 million of shares with int erest rates between 5% and 6% designated as nonredeemablepreferred stock and

December 31, 2018 , annual dividends on the Utility ’s nonredeemable preferred stock ranged from $1.25 to $1.50 per share.  The Utilit y’s redeemable preferredstock is subject to redemp
tion at the Utility’s option, in whole or in part, if the Utility pays the specified redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividendsthrough the redemption dat
e.  At December 31, 2018 , annual dividends on redeemab le preferred stock ranged from $1.09 to $1.25 per share. Dividends on all Utility pref
erred stock are cumulative.  All shares of preferred stock have voting rights and an equal preference in dividend and liquidation rights. Upon liquidation or dissolution of th
e Utility, holders of preferred stock would be entitled to the par value of such shares plus all accumulated and unpaiddividends, as specified for 
the class and series.  The Utility paid no dividends on preferred stock in 2018 (See "Dividends" in Note 5, above). The Utility paid $14 million of dividends on pref
erred stock in 2017 and 2016 . NOTE 7: EARNINGS PER SHARE
PG&E Corporation’s basic EPS is calcula
ted by dividing the income available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common sharesoutstanding.  PG&E Corporation applies th
e treasury stock method of reflecting the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based compensation in the calculation ofdiluted EPS.  The following is a reconc
iliation of PG&E Corporation’s income available for common shareholders and weighted average common sharesoutstanding for calcula

PG&E Corporation and the Utility use th
e asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  The income tax provision includes current and deferred
income taxes resulting from operations during the year. PG&E Corporation and the Utility estimate current period tax expense in addition to calculating deferredtax assets and liabilities.
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary tax and accounting timing differences, such as those arising from depreciationexpense.
126

PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return will besustained upon examination by t
axing authorities based on the merits of the position.  The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured based onthe largest amount of ben
efit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  As such, the difference between a tax position taken or expected tobe taken in a tax return 
in future periods and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to this guidance in the financial statements represents an unrecognizedtax benefit. 
Investment tax credits are deferre
d and amortized to income over time.  PG&E Corporation amortizes its investment tax credits over the projected investmentrecovery period.  The
 Utility amortizes its investment tax credits over the life of the related property in accordance with regulatory treatment.PG&E Corporation files a consolida
ted U.S. federal income tax return that includes the Utility and domestic subsidiaries in which its ownership is 80% or more. PG&E Corporation files a combined s
tate income tax return in California.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to a tax-sharing agreement under whichthe Utility determin
es its income tax provision (benefit) on a stand-alone basis. The significant components o

temporary income tax differences attributable to repair costs and certain other property-related costs for federal tax purposes.  For these temporary tax differences, PG&E Corporation and the
Utility recognize the deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabili
ties.  Therefore, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s effective tax rates areimpacted as these differences arise and reverse.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as i
t is probable that these amounts will berecovered from or returned to customers in future rates.  In 
2018 , the amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess deferred tax benefits to be refunded to customers as a result of the Tax Act passed in December 2017.

Primarily represents adjustments to compensation as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act.(4) 
Represents adjustments to deferred tax balances under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 reflecting the tax rate reduction required by the Tax Act.(5) 
These amounts primarily represents the impact of tax audit settlements.Unrecognized tax benefits

nrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate at December 31, 2018 for PG&E Corporation and the Utility was 
$5 million . PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s un
recognized tax benefits may change significantly within the next 12 months due to the resolution of seve ral matters,including audits.  As of 
December 31, 2018 , it is reasonably possible th at unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $50 million within the next 12 months 
. Interest income, int
erest expense and penalties associated with income taxes are reflected in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Forthe years ended 
December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , these amounts were imma terial.128

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enac
ted expansive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act. Among other provisions, the Tax Act reducesthe federal income 
tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and eliminated bonus depreciation for utilities. At December 31, 2017, PG&ECorporation and the Utility r
ecorded estimated provisional amounts to reflect the effect of the Tax Act in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.  In2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
corded an approximately $13 million tax benefit to adjust th e amount recorded in 2017 for the Tax Act upon obtaining,preparing, and analyzing add
itional information regarding facts and circumstances that existed as of the enactment date that, if known, would have affected theincome tax effects 
initially reported as provisional amounts.Although the accounting under ASC 740 to refl
ect the Tax Act is now complete, the Treasury is still issuing interpretive guidance on various aspects of the TaxAct. If future guidance r
equires a change in the recorded tax amounts, any necessary change will be reflected in the period such guidance is issued.In addition, the Utility f
iled the estimated revenue impact of the Tax Act with the CPUC and FERC in March and May of 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 
, the Utility still has not received final regulatory decisions. Depending on the final regulatory outcome, an adjustment may need to be made in the period thefinal decisions are issu
ed.Tax settlements
PG&E Corporation’s tax returns have b
een accepted through 2015 except for a few matters, the most significant of which relate to deductible repair costs for gastransmission and distribut
ion lines of business and tax deductions claimed for regulatory fines and fees assessed as part of the Penalty Decision issued in 2015 forthe San Bruno natural gas explosion in Sep
tember of 2010. In February 2017, the Joint Committee of Taxation approved PG&E Corporation’s settlement with theIRS related to deductible 
electric transmission and distribution repairs for the 2011 and 2012 tax years.  The agreement provided that the methodology used indetermining the deduct
ible amount should be followed for all subsequent periods, absent any material change in facts.  In November 2017, PG&E Corporationreached an agreemen
t with the IRS on deductible generation repairs for the 2013 and 2014 tax years. Tax years after 2007 remai
n subject to examination by the state of California.Carryforwards

e Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. PG&E Corporation does notbelieve that the Chapte
r 11 Cases resulted in loss of or limitation on the utilization of any of the tax carryforwards. PG&E Corporation will continue to monitor thestatus during the pendency of th
e Chapter 11 Cases.NOTE 9: DERIVATIVES
Use of Derivative Instruments
The Utility is expo
sed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities. Procurement costs are recovered throughcustomer rates. The Utilit
y uses both derivative and non-derivative contracts to manage volatility in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices.Derivatives include cont
racts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter.
Derivatives are presen
ted in the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets recorded at fair value and on a net basis in accordance with master netting arrangements foreach counter-party. The 
fair value of derivative instruments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the intention to offsetexist.
Price risk management 
instruments are not held for speculative purposes and are subject to certain regulatory requirements.  The Utility expects to fully recover inrates all costs related to deri
vatives under the applicable ratemaking mechanism in place as long as the Utility’s price risk management activities are carried out inaccordance with CPUC directives.  The
refore, all unrealized gains and losses associated with the change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recordedwithin the Utility’s regul
atory assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Net realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives are recorded in the
cost of electricity or the cost of natural gas with corresponding increases or decreases to regulatory balancing accounts for recovery from or refund to customers.The Utility elects the no
rmal purchase and sale exception for eligible derivatives.  Eligible derivatives are those that require physical delivery in quantities that areexpected to be used by the Util
ity over a reasonable period in the normal course of business, and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the commoditydelivered.  These items 
are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Volume of Derivative Activity
At 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, the volum es of the Utility’s outstanding derivatives were as follows:

ity’s derivatives instruments, including certain power purchase agreements, contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s creditrating from each of the major
 credit rating agencies, also known as a credit-risk-related contingent feature. In January 2019, multiple credit rating agenciesdowngraded the Utility below invest
ment grade, resulting in the Utility posting $6.2 million to fully collateralize its net liabilit y derivative positions.NOTE 10: FAIR VALUE 
MEASUREMENTSPG&E Corporation and the Utility me
asure their cash equivalents, trust assets and price risk management instruments at fair value.  A three-tier fair valuehierarchy is establish
ed that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:•
Level 1 – Observable inputs t hat reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.•
Level 2 – Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.•
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs which are support ed by little or no market activities.The fair value hiera
rchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.130

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for PG&E Corporation and the Utility are summarized below.  Assets held in rabbi trusts are heldby PG&E Corporation and not the Utility.

The following describes the va
luation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the tables above.  There are no restrictions onthe terms and conditions upon which 
the investments may be redeemed.  Transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are recognized as of the end of thereporting period.  There wer
e no material transfers between any levels for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Trust Assets
Assets

Fair
Value
In general, investments h
eld in the trusts are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and market volatility risks.Nuclear decommissioning t
rust assets and other trust assets are composed primarily of equity and fixed-income securities and also include short-term investmentsthat are money marke
t funds valued at Level 1.Global equity securities p
rimarily include investments in common stock that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1.132

Fixed-income securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, includingcorporate debt securi
ties.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value isdetermined by observable
 market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of fixed-income securities classified asLevel 2 using evaluated pri
cing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation modelgenerally include bench
mark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuationmodel, as applicable.

lance Sheets.  These investments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchangesas well as fixed-income s
ecurities that are composed primarily of U.S. government securities and asset-backed securities.Price Risk Management Instruments
Price risk management 
instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, andCRRs that are traded either on 
an exchange or over-the-counter. Power purchase agreements, fo
rwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded futures that are valued using observable marketforward prices for the unde
rlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-traded futures, or arevalued using forward prices f
rom broker quotes that are corroborated with market data are classified as Level 2.  Exchange-traded options are valued usingobservable market data and
 market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2. Long-dated power purchase agre
ements that are valued using significant unobservable data are classified as Level 3.  These Level 3 contracts are valued usingeither estimated b
asis adjustments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends beyond aperiod for which market da
ta is available.  Market and credit risk management utilizes models to derive pricing inputs for the valuation of the Utility’s Level 3instruments using pricing inpu
ts from brokers and historical data.The Utility holds CRRs to hedge the financ
ial risk of CAISO-imposed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is available in the CAISOauction and between auction d
ates; therefore, the Utility utilizes historical prices to forecast forward prices. CRRs are classified as Level 3.Level 3 Measurements and Sensitivity Analysis
The Utility’s market and 
credit risk management function, which reports to the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for determining the fair value of the Utility’sprice risk management derivative
s.  The Utility’s finance and risk management functions collaborate to determine the appropriate fair value methodologies andclassification for 
each derivative.  Inputs used and the fair value of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions todetermine reasonableness.
Significant increases o
r decreases in any of those inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reasonable costs related toLevel 3 instruments are e
xpected to be recoverable through customer rates; therefore, there is no impact to net income resulting from changes in the fair value ofthese instruments.  See Note 9 abov

-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees hired before December 31, 2012 and a cashbalance plan for those e
ligible employees hired after this date or who made a one-time election to participate (“Pension Plan”).  Certain trusts underlying theseplans are qualified t
rusts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  If certain conditions are met, PG&E Corporation and the Utility can deductpayments made to the qual
ified trusts, subject to certain limitations.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funding policy is to contribute tax-deductible amounts,consistent with applicabl
e regulatory decisions and federal minimum funding requirements.  On an annual basis, the Utility funds the pension plans up to theamount it is authorized 
to recover in rates, $327 million for both 2018 and 2017 . 135

PG&E Corporation and the Utility also sponsor contributory postretirement medical plans for retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributorypostretirement life insurance pla
ns for eligible employees and retirees.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility use a fiscal year-end measurement date for all plans.On February 27, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
received approval from the Bankruptcy Court to maintain existing pension and other benefit plans duringthe pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses related to pension and post-retirement benefits otherthan pension as components of ac
cumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.  In addition, regulatory adjustments are recorded in the ConsolidatedStatements of Income and Consol
idated Balance Sheets to reflect the difference between expense or income calculated in accordance with GAAP for accountingpurposes and expense or income fo
r ratemaking purposes, which is based on authorized plan contributions.  For pension benefits, a regulatory asset or liability isrecorded for amounts tha
t would otherwise be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.  For post-retirement benefits other than pension, the Utilitygenerally records a r
egulatory liability for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.  As the Utility is unable torecord a regulatory ass
et for these other benefits, the charge remains in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).The estimated amounts th
at will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs for PG&E Corporation in 2019 are as follows: (in millions)

rn on plan assets were developed by determining projected stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target assetallocations of the emp
loyee benefit plan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Returns on fixed-income debt investments wereprojected based on real 
maturity and credit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate.  Returns on equity investments were estimated based on estimates ofdividend yield and real e
arnings growth added to a long-term inflation rate.  For the pension plan, the assumed return of 6.0% compares to a ten-yea r actual returnof 
10.0% .  The rate used to discount pension b enefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of over approximately 1,101 Aa- grade non-callable bonds a
t December 31, 2018 .  This yield curve has discount r ates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cashflows for the pension benefits 
and other benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.Investment Policies and Strategies
The financial position of PG&E Corpor
ation’s and the Utility’s funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefitobligations.  Volatility in 
funded status occurs when asset values change differently from liability values and can result in fluctuations in costs in financialreporting, as well as the a
mount of minimum contributions required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.  PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s investment policies and strategies are designed to increase the ratio of trust assets to plan liabilities at an acceptable level of fundedstatus volatility. 
The trusts’ asset alloc
ations are meant to manage volatility, reduce costs, and diversify its holdings.  Interest rate, credit, and equity risk are the key determinants ofPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
funded status volatility.  In addition to affecting the trusts’ fixed income portfolio market values, interest rate changes alsoinfluence liabili
ty valuations as discount rates move with current bond yields.  To manage volatility, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s trusts hold significantallocations in long matu
rity fixed-income investments. Although they contribute to funded status volatility, equity investments are held to reduce long-termfunding costs due to their highe
r expected return.  Real assets and absolute return investments are held to diversify the trust’s holdings in equity and fixed-incomeinvestments by exhibiting r
eturns with low correlation to the direction of these markets. Real assets include commodities futures, global REITS, global listedinfrastructure equi
ties, and private real estate funds.  Absolute return investments include hedge fund portfolios. Derivative instruments su
ch as equity index futures are used to meet target equity exposure. Derivative instruments, such as equity index futures and U.S. treasuryfutures, are also used to r
ebalance the fixed income/equity allocation of the pension’s portfolio. Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge a portion ofthe non U.S. dollar exposure of global equ
ity investments.The target asset allocation 
percentages for major categories of trust assets for pension and other benefit plans are as follows:

PG&E Corporation and the Utility apply a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets.  The guidingprinciples of this risk
 management framework are the clear articulation of roles and responsibilities, appropriate delegation of authority, and proper accountabilityand documentation.  Trust inves
tment policies and investment manager guidelines include provisions designed to ensure prudent diversification, manage riskthrough appropriate use of physi
cal direct asset holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited investments.Fair Value Measurements

and 2017 , respectively, comprised  primarily of cash, accounts receivable, deferred taxes, and accounts payable. Valuation Techniques
The following describes the va
luation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the table above.  All investments that arevalued using a net asset valu
e per share can be redeemed quarterly with a notice not to exceed 90 days.Short-Term Investments
Short-term investments 
consist primarily of commingled funds across government, credit, and asset-backed sectors. These securities are categorized as Level 1 andLevel 2 assets.
Global Equity securities
The global equity category 
includes investments in common stock and equity-index futures.  Equity investments in common stock are actively traded on publicexchanges and are there
fore considered Level 1 assets.  These equity investments are generally valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets for identicalsecurities.  Equity-index 
futures are valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets and are Level 1 assets.140

Real AssetsThe real asset catego
ry includes portfolios of commodity futures, global REITS, global listed infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  The commodityfutures, global REITS, and global lis
ted infrastructure equities are actively traded on a public exchange and are therefore considered Level 1 assets. Fixed-Income securities
Fixed-income securiti
es are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, includingcorporate debt securi
ties.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value isdetermined by observable
 market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of debt securities classified as Level 2using evaluated pricing da
ta such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation modelgenerally include bench
mark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuationmodel, as applicable.
Assets Measured at NAV Using Practical Expedient
Investments in the trusts 
that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tablesabove. The fair value amoun
ts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Theseinvestments include com
mingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchanges as well as fixed-income securities that are composedprimarily of U.S. government se
curities, asset-backed securities, and private real estate funds. There are no restrictions on the terms and conditions upon which theinvestments may be redeemed.
Transfers Between Levels
Any transfers between levels 
in the fair value hierarchy are recognized as of the end of the reporting period.  No material transfers between levels occurred in theyears ended 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Level 3 Reconciliation

There were no material transfers out of Level 3 in 2018 and 2017 . Cash Flow Information
Employer Contributions
PG&E Corporation and the Utility cont
ributed $334 million to the pension benefit plans and $31 million to the other benefit pl ans in 2018 .  These contributions are consistent with PG&E Corporation
’s and the Utility’s funding policy, which is to contribute amounts that are tax-deductible and consistent with applicableregulatory decisions and f
ederal minimum funding requirements.  None of these pension or other benefits were subject to a minimum funding requirementrequiring a cash contribu
tion in 2018 .  The Utility’s pension benefi ts met all the funding requirements under Employee Retirement Income Security Act.  PG&ECorporation and the Utility exp

Retirement Savings Plan
PG&E Corporation sponsors a retirem
ent savings plan, which qualifies as a 401(k) defined contribution benefit plan under the Internal Revenue Code 1986, asamended.  This plan permits 
eligible employees to make pre-tax and after-tax contributions into the plan, and provide for employer contributions to be made toeligible particip
ants.  Total expenses recognized for defined contribution benefit plans reflected in PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Income were$105 million 
, $103 million , and $97 million in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. There were no materia
l differences between the employer contribution expense for PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the years presented above.NOTE 12: RELATED PARTY A
GREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONSThe Utility and other subsidia
ries provide and receive various services to and from their parent, PG&E Corporation, and among themselves.  The Utility andPG&E Corporation exchange administ
rative and professional services in support of operations.  Services provided directly to PG&E Corporation by the Utility arepriced at the higher of 
fully loaded cost (i.e., direct cost of good or service and allocation of overhead costs) or fair market value, depending on the nature of theservices.  Services provided d
irectly to the Utility by PG&E Corporation are generally priced at the lower of fully loaded cost or fair market value, depending onthe nature and value of th
e services.  PG&E Corporation also allocates various corporate administrative and general costs to the Utility and other subsidiaries usingagreed-upon allocation 
factors, including the number of employees, operating and maintenance expenses, total assets, and other cost allocation methodologies. Management believes that the
 methods used to allocate expenses are reasonable and meet the reporting and accounting requirements of its regulatory agencies.142

-RELATED CONTINGENCIESPG&E Corporation and the Utility have s
ignificant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to wildfires. A provision for a losscontingency is recorded when i
t is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. PG&E Corporationand the Utility evaluate 
which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonably estimated losses and record a charge that reflects their bestestimate or the lower 
end of the range, if there is no better estimate. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or arange of losses is estimab
le, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and estimates areadjusted to reflect 
the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and otherinformation and events pe
rtaining to a particular matter. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs,which are expensed as incurr
ed. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materiallyaffected by the outcom
e of the following matters.143

On November 8, 2018, a wildfire began nea
r the city of Paradise, Butte County, California (the “2018 Camp fire”), which is located in the Utility’s serviceterritory. Cal Fire's Camp Fir
e Incident Information Website as of January 4, 2019, (the “Cal Fire website”), indicated that the 2018 Camp fire consumed 153,336 acres. On the Cal Fire website, Cal Fi
re reported 86  fatalities and the destruction of 13,972 residences, 528 commercial structures and 4,293 other buildings resulting from the 2018 Camp f
ire. On February 7, 2019, the Butte County Sheriff's Office reported that the number of fatalities resulting from the 2018 Camp firehad been reduced from 
86 to 85 .Although the cause of the 2018 Camp fi
re is still under investigation, based on the information currently known to PG&E Corporation and the Utility and reportedto the CPUC and other agencies, including 
the facts described below, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that the Utility’s equipment will bedetermined to be an igni
tion point of the 2018 Camp fire.144

The Utility submitted two Electric Incident Reports (the “EIRs”) to the CPUC: one on November 8, 2018 and one on November 16, 2018. On December 11, 2018,the Utility publicly re
leased a letter to the CPUC supplementing the EIRs (the “ 20 -Day Electric Incident Report”), which stated:•
On Cal Fire’s website, Cal Fire has identified coordinates for the 2018 Camp fire near Tower :27/222 on the Utility’s Caribou-Palermo 115 kVTransmission Line and has ident
ified the start time of the 2018 Camp fire as 6:33 a.m. on November 8, 2018.•
On November 8, 2018, at approximately 6:15 a.m., the Utility’s Caribou-Palermo 115kV Transmission Line relayed and deenergized. At approximately6:30 a.m. that day, a Utility 
employee observed fire in the vicinity of Tower :27/222, and this observation was reported to 911 by Utility employees. In theafternoon of November 8, the Uti
lity observed damage on the line at Tower :27/222. Specifically, an aerial patrol identified that a suspension insulatorsupporting a transposition jump
er had separated from an arm on Tower :27/222.•
On November 14, 2018, the Utility observed a broken C-hook attached to the separated suspension insulator that had connected the suspension insulatorto a tower arm, along with wear 
at the connection point. In addition, the Utility observed a flash mark on Tower :27/222 near where the transpositionjumper was suspended and damage to 
the transposition jumper and suspension insulator.•
In addition to the events on the Caribou-Palermo 115kV Transmission Line, on November 8, 2018, at approximately 6:45 a.m., the Utility’s Big Bend1101 12 kV Circuit experienced an out
age. On November 9, 2018, a Utility employee on patrol arrived at the location of the pole with Line Recloser(“LR”) 1704 on the Big Bend 1101 Circuit and observ
ed that the pole and other equipment were on the ground with bullets and bullet holes at the breakpoint of the pole and on the equip
ment. On November 12, 2018, a Utility employee was patrolling Concow Road north of LR 1704 when he observedwires down and damaged and downed poles at th
e intersection of Concow Road and Rim Road. At this location, the employee observed several snappedtrees, with some on top of the downed wir
es.The information contain
ed in the EIRs and the 20-Day Electric Incident Report is factual and preliminary and does not reflect a determination of the causes of the2018 Camp fire. These incidents 
remain under investigation by Cal Fire and the CPUC. With respect to the potential ignition point on the Utility’s Big Bend 110112 kV Circuit, although Cal Fire has iden
tified this location as a potential ignition point, based on the condition of the site, PG&E Corporation and the Utility havenot been able to determ
ine whether the Big Bend 1101 12 kV Circuit may be a probable ignition point for the 2018 Camp fire. Neither Cal Fire nor the CPUC haspublicly issued any news releas
es or other determinations for the 2018 Camp fire. The timing and outcome of the investigations are uncertain. PG&E Corporationand the Utility are coope
rating with Cal Fire and the CPUC.Further, the CPUC’s SED is conducting investigations 
to assess the compliance of electric and communication companies’ facilities with applicable rules andregulations in fire-
impacted areas. According to information made available by the CPUC, investigation topics include, but are not limited to, maintenance offacilities, veget
ation management, and emergency preparedness and response. Various other entities, including fire departments, may also be investigating the fire.It is uncertain when the inv
estigations will be complete and whether the SED will release any preliminary findings before its investigations are complete.2017 Northern California Wildfires Background
Beginning on October 8, 2017, multiple wild
fires spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Lake, Nevada, andYuba Counties, as well as in the are
a surrounding Yuba City (the “2017 Northern California wildfires”). According to the Cal Fire California Statewide FireSummary dated October 30, 2017, at th
e peak of the 2017 Northern California wildfires, there were 21 major fires that, in total, burned over 245,000 acres and destroyed an estimated 
8,900 structures. The 2017 Northern Cali fornia wildfires resulted in 44 fatalities.145

Cal Fire has issued its determination on the causes of 19 of the 2017 Northern California wildfires, and alleged that all of these fires, with the exception of theTubbs fire, involved the Utili
ty's equipment. The remaining wildfires remain under Cal Fire's investigation, including the possible role of the Utility's power linesand other facilities.
During the second quarter of 2018, Cal Fi
re issued news releases announcing its determination on the causes of 16 of the 2017 Northern California wildfires (theLa Porte, McCourtney, Lobo, Honey, Redwood, Sulphur, Cherokee, 37, Blue, Norrbom, Adobe, Pa
rtrick, Pythian, Nuns, Pocket and Atlas fires, located inMendocino, Lake, Butte, Sonoma, Humboldt, Nevada 
and Napa counties). According to the Cal Fire news releases, the first four fires “were caused by trees coming into contact with power 
lines” and the remaining 12 fires “were caused by electric power and distribution lines, conductors and the failure of power poles.”Cal Fire has not yet releas
ed its investigation reports related to the McCourtney, Lobo, Sulphur, Blue, Norrbom, Adobe, Partrick, Pythian, Pocket and Atlas firesand stated in its news rele
ases that these investigations have been referred to the appropriate county District Attorney’s offices for review “due to evidence ofalleged violations of st
ate law.” The Butte County District Attorney's office has entered into a settlement agreement with the Utility, resolving the Honey,Cherokee and LaP
orte fire allegations without criminal or civil charges. The timing and outcome for resolution of the remaining referrals are uncertain.Also during the second quarter of 2018, Ca
l Fire released its investigation reports related to the Redwood, Cherokee, 37, Nuns and La Porte fires. Cal Fire did notrefer these fires 
to District Attorney offices for investigation.On October 9, 2018, Cal Fire issued a news rele
ase announcing the results of its investigation into the Cascade fire, located in Yuba County, concluding that theCascade fire “was start
ed by sagging power lines coming into contact during heavy winds” and that “the power line in question was owned by Pacific Gas andElectric Company.” On October 10, 2018, Cal Fi
re released its investigation report related to the Cascade fire.On January 24, 2019, Cal Fire issued a news rele
ase and its investigation report into the cause of the Tubbs fire. Cal Fire has determined that the Tubbs fire wascaused by a private electrical 
system adjacent to a residential structure.Cal Fire has not publicly issued any n
ews releases or other determinations for the Maacama, Pressley and Point wildfires. The timing and outcome of the Cal Fireinvestigation into these 
fires is uncertain.Further, the SED is conducting investig
ations to assess the compliance of electric and communication companies’ facilities with applicable rules and regulations infire-impacted areas. According
 to information made available by the CPUC, investigation topics include, but are not limited to, maintenance of facilities,vegetation managemen
t, and emergency preparedness and response. Various other entities, including fire departments, may also be investigating certain of thefires. It is uncerta
in when the investigations will be complete and whether the SED will release any preliminary findings before its investigations are complete.The Utility has submitted 
23 electric incident reports to the CPUC associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires where Cal Fire or the Utility hasidentified a site as potentiall
y involving the Utility’s facilities in its investigation and the property damage associated with each incident exceeded $ 50,000 . The information contained in t
hese reports is factual and preliminary and does not reflect a determination of the causes of the fires.Third-Party Claims, Investigations and Other Proceedings Rela
ted to the 2018 Camp Fire and 2017 Northern California WildfiresIf the Utility’s fac
ilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be the substantial cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine ofinverse condemnation appl
ies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees without having been foundnegligent. California cou
rts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on thegrounds that losses borne by the person whose p
roperty was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefited fromsuch undertaking, and based on the assu
mption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers. Further, California courts have determinedthat the doctrine of inv
erse condemnation is applicable regardless of whether the CPUC ultimately allows recovery by the utility for any such costs. The CPUCmay decide not to authori
ze cost recovery even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inversecondemnation. (See “Loss Recover
ies-Regulatory Recovery” below for further information regarding potential cost recovery related to the wildfires, including inconnection with SB 901.)

In addition to claims for property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees, the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs,medical expenses, persona
l injury damages, punitive damages and other damages under other theories of liability, including if the Utility were found to have beennegligent.
Further, the Utility could be sub
ject to material fines or penalties if the CPUC or any law enforcement agency brought an enforcement action, including a criminalproceeding, and determin
ed that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.As of January 28, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty are aware of approximately 100 complaints on behalf of at least 4,200 plaintiffs relat ed to the 2018Camp fire, 
nine of which seek to be certif ied as class actions. The pending civil litigation against PG&E Corporation and the Utility related to the 2018 Camp fire,which is currently stayed as 
a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, includes claims under multiple theories of liability, including inversecondemnation, trespass, priv
ate nuisance, public nuisance, negligence, negligence per se, negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, negligentinfliction of emotion
al distress, premises liability, violations of the Public Utilities Code, violations of the Health & Safety Code, malice and false advertising inviolation of the Californ
ia Business and Professions Code. The plaintiffs principally assert that PG&E Corporation's and the Utility’s alleged failure to maintainand repair their dist
ribution and transmission lines and failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the 2018 Camp fire.The plaintiffs seek dam
ages and remedies that include wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, evacuation costs, medical expenses, establishment of aclass action medica
l monitoring fund, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to suchclaims are expect
ed to be determined through the Chapter 11 process.As of January 28, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty are aware of approximately 750 complaints on behalf of at least 3,800 plaintiffs relat ed to the 2017Northern California wildfi
res, five of which seek to be certified as class actions. These cases have been coordinated in the San Francisco County Superior Court.As of the Petition Date, the coord
inated litigation was in the early stages of discovery. A trial with respect to the Atlas fire was scheduled to begin on September23, 2019. The pending civil litiga
tion against PG&E Corporation and the Utility related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, includes claims under multipletheories of liabili
ty, including inverse condemnation, trespass, private nuisance and negligence. This litigation, including the trial date with respect to the Atlas fire,currently is stayed as a 
result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. The plaintiffs principally assert that PG&E Corporation's and the Utility’s allegedfailure to mainta
in and repair their distribution and transmission lines and failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the2017 Northern California wildfi
res. The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, evacuation costs, medicalexpenses, punitive damages, a
ttorneys’ fees and other damages. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to such claims are expected to bedetermined through the Chapt
er 11 process.Insurance carriers who hav
e made payments to their insureds for property damage arising out of the 2017 Northern California wildfires have filed 48 subrogationcomplaints in the San Francis
co County Superior Court as of January 28, 2019. These complaints allege, among other things, negligence, inverse condemnation,trespass and nuisance. The al
legations are similar to the ones made by individual plaintiffs. As of January 28, 2019, insurance carriers have filed 37 similarsubrogation complaints with r
espect to the 2018 Camp fire in the Sacramento County Superior Court. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations withrespect to such claims 
are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process.Various government entiti
es, including Yuba, Nevada, Lake, Mendocino, Napa and Sonoma Counties and the Cities of Santa Rosa and Clearlake, also haveasserted claims aga
inst PG&E Corporation and the Utility based on the damages that these government entities allegedly suffered as a result of the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires. Such a
lleged damages include, among other things, loss of natural resources, loss of public parks, property damages and fire suppressioncosts. The causes of action and 
allegations are similar to the ones made by individual plaintiffs and the insurance carriers. With respect to the 2018 Camp fire,Butte County has filed simila
r claims against PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect additional similar claims to bemade by other government en
tities. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through theChapter 11 process.
On March 16, 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed a demurrer to the inverse condemnation cause of action in the 2017 Northern California wildfireslitigation. On May 21, 2018, the court ov
erruled the motion. On July 20, 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a writ in the Court of Appeal requestingappellate review of th
e trial court's decision, which was denied on September 17, 2018. On September 27, 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a petitionfor review to the Californ
ia Supreme Court. On November 14, 2018, the California Supreme Court denied PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's petition forreview.
147

PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to be the subject of numerous additional claims in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern Californiawildfires. PG&E Corporation's and the Uti
lity's obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process.PG&E Corporation and the Utility also 
are the subject of criminal investigations or other actions by the county District Attorneys to whom Cal Fire has referred itsinvestigations into the McCour
tney, Lobo, Sulphur, Blue, Norrbom, Adobe, Partrick, Pythian, Pocket and Atlas fires. Although the Honey fire was referred to theButte County District Attorney’s Off
ice, in October 2018, the Utility reached an agreement to settle any civil claims or criminal charges that could have beenbrought by the Butte County District Atto
rney in connection with the Honey fire, as well as the La Porte and Cherokee fires (which were not referred). Thesettlement provides fo
r funding by the Utility for at least four years of an enhanced fir e prevention and communication program, in the amount of up to $1.5 million 
, not recoverable in ra tes. On October 9, 2018, the District Attorney of Yuba County announced his decision not to pursue criminal charges at such timeagainst PG&E Corporation or the Util
ity pertaining to the Cascade fire. The Office of the District Attorney of Yuba County also indicated that it “reserves the rightto review any additional in
formation or evidence that may be submitted to it prior to the expiration of the criminal statute of limitations.”Also in October 2018, the Utility and th
e Sonoma, Napa, Lake, Humboldt and Nevada County District Attorneys entered into agreements under which the Utilityagreed to waive any applic
able statutes of limitation related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires that started in these counties for a period of six months , until April 8, 2019. PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
anticipate further discussions with the District Attorneys in these counties relating to the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires and whe
ther any criminal or civil charges should be brought. In addition, the Butte County District Attorney’s Office and the CaliforniaAttorney General’s Office h
ave opened a criminal investigation of the 2018 Camp fire. Additional investigations and other actions may arise out of the other 2017Northern California wildfi
res and the 2018 Camp fire. Such proceedings are not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of theChapter 11 Cases; however, collec
tion efforts in connection with fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e continuing to review the evidence concerning the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. PG&ECorporation and the Utility hav
e not yet had access to all of the evidence collected by Cal Fire as part of its investigations or to the many investigation reportsprepared by Cal Fire. PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility and plaintiffs are in discussions with Cal Fire about access to the evidence and the remaining reports. Noschedule on gaining access has b
een set.Regardless of any determin
ations of cause by Cal Fire with respect to any pre-petition fire, ultimately PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability will beresolved through the Chapter 11 pro
cess, regulatory proceedings and any potential enforcement proceedings, all of which could take a number of years to resolve.The timing and outcome of th
ese and other potential proceedings are uncertain.Potential Losses in Connection with the 2018 Camp Fire and 2017 Northern California Wildfi
resOn January 28, 2019, the California Depar
tment of Insurance issued a news release announcing an update on property losses in connection with the 2018 wildfiresin Southern California (which a
re not in the Utility’s service territory) and the 2018 Camp fire, stating that, as of such date, “more than $11.4 billion in insured losses have been reported f
rom the November 2018 fires,” of which approximately $8.4 billion relates to statewide claims from the 2018 Camp fire. On September6, 2018, the California Departm
ent of Insurance issued a news release announcing that insurers have received nearly 55,000 insurance claims tot aling more than$12.28 billion 
in losses, of which approximate ly $10 billion relates to statewide claims from the 2017 Northern California wildfires.The dollar amounts announced by th
e California Department of Insurance represent an aggregate amount of approximately $18.4 billion of insurance claims made as of the above dates rel
ated to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect that additional claims havebeen submitted and will cont
inue to be submitted to insurers, particularly with respect to the 2018 Camp fire. These claims reflect insured property losses only. The$18.4 billion 
of insurance claims m ade as of the above dates does not account for uninsured or underinsured property losses, interest, attorneys’ fees, firesuppression and clean-up costs, ev
acuation costs, personal injury or wrongful death damages, medical expenses or other costs, such as potential punitive damages,fines or penalties, or loss
es related to claims that have not manifested yet ("future claims"), each of which could be significant. The scope of all claims related tothe 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern Cal
ifornia wildfires is not known at this time because of the applicable statutes of limitations under California law.148

Potential liabilities related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires depend on various factors, including but not limited to the cause of eachfire, contributing caus
es of the fires (including alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged ordestroyed, the contents of such s
tructures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants,the nature and extent of 
any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs,other damages the Utili
ty may be responsible for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities.There are a number of unknown fa
cts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability. Among other things, it is uncertain at this timeas to the number of wildfir
e-related claims that will be filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, the number of current and future claims that will be allowed by theBankruptcy Court, how claims for punit
ive damages and claims by variously situated persons will be treated and whether such claims will be allowed, and theimpact that histori
cal settlement values for wildfire claims may have on the estimation of wildfire liability in the Chapter 11 Cases. If PG&E Corporation and theUtility were to be found liab
le for certain or all of the costs, expenses and other losses described above with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires, th
e amount of such liability could exceed $30 billion , which amount does not include poten tial punitive damages, fines and penalties ordamages related to fu
ture claims. This estimate is based on a wide variety of data and other information available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility and theiradvisors, including various pre
cedents involving similar claims, and accounts for property losses (including insured, uninsured and underinsured property losses),interest, attorneys’ 
fees, fire suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs, personal injury or wrongful death damages, medical expenses and certain othercosts. This estimate is not 
intended to provide an upper end of the range of potential liability arising from the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern Californiawildfires. In certain 
circumstances, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability could be substantially greater than such amount.If PG&E Corporation and the Utility we
re to be found liable for any punitive damages or subject to fines or penalties, the amount of such punitive damages, finesand penalties could be signi
ficant. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have received significant fines and penalties in connection with past incidents. For example,in 2015, the CPUC approved a decision that impos
ed penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6 billion in connection with the natur al gas explosion that occurred in theCity of San Bruno, California on Septembe
r 9, 2010 (the “San Bruno explosion”). These penalties represented nearly three times the underlying liability for theSan Bruno explosion of approximately 
$558 million incurred for third-pa rty claims, exclusive of shareholder derivative lawsuits and legal costs incurred. Theamount of punitive damages, 
fines and penalties imposed on PG&E Corporation and the Utility could likewise be a significant amount in relation to the underlyingliabilities with resp
ect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to such claimsare expected to be det
ermined through the Chapter 11 process. Such proceedings are not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement ofthe Chapter 11 Cases; however, coll
ection efforts in connection with fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.2018 Camp Fire and 2017 Northern California Wildfires Accounting Charge
Following accounting rules, PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility record a liability when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. In accordance with U.S.generally accepted 
accounting principles, PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonablyestimated losses, and re
cord a charge that is the amount within the range that is a better estimate than any other amount or the lower end of the range, if there is nobetter estimate. Th
e assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of losses is estimable, often involves a seriesof complex judgments about fu
ture events.2018 Camp Fire
In light of the current s
tate of the law and the information currently available to the Utility, including, among other things, the facts described in the EIRs and the20 
-Day Electric Incident Report, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have determined that it is probable they will incur a loss for claims in connection with the2018 Camp fire, and accordingly PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility recorded a charge in the amount of $10.5 billion for the year ended Decemb er 31, 2018. Thischarge corresponds to the lowe
r end of the range of PG&E Corporation's and the Utility’s reasonably estimated losses, and is subject to change based on additionalinformation.
149

PG&E Corporation and the Utility currently believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of the loss related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires wil
l be greater than the amount accrued, but are unable to reasonably estimate the additional loss and the upper end of the range because thereare a number of unknown facts and 
legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims thatmay be asserted against PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to continue to review the available information and otherinformation as it beco
mes available, including evidence in Cal Fire’s possession, evidence from or held by other parties, claims that have not yet been submitted,and additional informa
tion about the nature and extent of personal and business property damage and losses, the nature, number and severity of personal injuries,and information made av
ailable through the discovery process.The process for estimat
ing losses associated with claims requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjectivefactors, including but not l
imited to factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires. As moreinformation becomes av
ailable, management estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the 2018 Camp fire may change, which could result inmaterial incre
ases to the loss accrued.The 
$10.5 billion charge does not include any a mounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or theUtility, or punitive damag
es, if any, or any losses related to future claims for damages that have not manifested yet, each of which could be significant.2017 Northern California Wildfires
In light of the current s
tate of the law on inverse condemnation and the information currently available to the Utility, including, among other things, the Cal Firedeterminations of caus
e as stated in Cal Fire’s press releases and their released reports, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have determined that it is probable theywill incur a loss for cla
ims in connection with 17 of the 2017 Northern California wildfires referred to as the La Porte, McCourtney, Lobo, Honey, Redwood,Sulphur, Cherokee, Blue, Pocket, Atlas, Cascade, Poin
t and Sonoma/Napa merged fires (which include the Nuns, Norrbom, Adobe, Partrick and Pythian fires).Accordingly, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity recorded a charge in the amount of $2.5 billion during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and a charge in the amountof 
$1.0 billion during the quarter ended Dec ember 31, 2018, for a total charge in the amount of $3.5 billion for the year ended Decemb er 31, 2018. This chargecorresponds to the lower end of th
e range of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reasonably estimated losses and is subject to change based on additionalinformation. The addition
al charge recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 resulted from additional information obtained by the Utility during that periodabout the fires.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility cur
rently believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of the loss related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires andthe 2018 Camp fire will be gre
ater than the amount accrued, but are unable to reasonably estimate the additional loss and the upper end of the range because thereare a number of unknown facts and 
legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims thatmay be asserted against PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to continue to review the available information and otherinformation as it beco
mes available, including evidence in Cal Fire’s possession, evidence from or held by other parties, claims that have not yet been submitted,and additional informa
tion about the nature and extent of personal and business property damage and losses, the nature, number and severity of personal injuries,and information made av
ailable through the discovery process.The process for estimat
ing losses associated with claims requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjectivefactors, including but not l
imited to factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires. As moreinformation becomes available,
 management estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the 2017 Northern California wildfires may change,which could result in mate
rial increases to the loss accrued.The 
$3.5 billion charge does not include any a mounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or theUtility, or punitive damag
es, if any, or any losses related to future claims for damages that have not manifested yet, each of which could be significant.The 
$3.5 billion charge also does not include any amounts in connection with the 37, Tubbs, Maacama and Pressley fires because at this time PG&E Corporationand the Utility have not conc
luded that a loss arising from those fires is probable. However, in the future it is possible that facts could emerge that lead PG&ECorporation and the Utility to b
elieve that a loss is probable, resulting in the accrual of a liability at that time, the amount of which could be significant.150

Loss RecoveriesPG&E Corporation and the Utility had insu
rance coverage for liabilities, including wildfire. Additionally, there are several mechanisms that allow for recovery ofcosts from customers. Potent
ial for recovery is described below. Failure to obtain a substantial or full recovery of costs related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017Northern California wildfi
res or any conclusion that such recovery is no longer probable could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sfinancial condition, r
esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the inability to recover costs in in a timely manner could have a material effect onPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.Insurance
PG&E Corporation and the Utility had 
$842 million of insurance coverage fo r liabilities, including wildfire events, for the period from August 1, 2017 throughJuly 31, 2018, subject to an initia
l self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence and further rete ntions of approximately $40 million per occurrence. During the third quarter of 2018, PG&E Corpora
tion and the Utility renewed their liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately$1.4 billion 
for the period from August 1, 2018 through Ju ly 31, 2019, comprised of $700 million for general liability (subject t o an initial self-insured retention of$10 million 
per occurrence), and $700 million for property damages only, which p roperty damage coverage includes an aggregate amount of approximately $200 million 
through the reinsurance m arket where a catastrophe bond was utilized. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to face increasing difficulty securingliability insurance in future
 years due to availability and to face significantly increased insurance costs.PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord a receivable for insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that recovery of a recorded loss will occur. ThroughDecember 31, 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity recorded $1.38 billion for probable insurance r ecoveries in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and $842 million 
for probable insurance r ecoveries in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. These amounts reflect an assumption that the cause of eachfire is deemed to be a s
eparate occurrence under the insurance policies. The amount of the receivable is subject to change based on additional information. PG&ECorporation and the Utility in
tend to seek full recovery for all insured losses and believe it is reasonably possible that they will record a receivable for the fullamount of the insurance l
imits in the future.If PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
are unable to recover the full amount of their insurance, or if insurance is otherwise unavailable, PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. Even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility were to recoverthe full amount of thei
r insurance, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect their losses in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern Californiawildfires will greatly excee
d their available insurance.The following table presents 
changes in the insurance receivable for the year ended December 31, 2018. The balance for insurance receivable is included in Otheraccounts receivable

Regulatory RecoveryOn June 21, 2018, the CPUC issued a decision granting the Uti
lity’s request to establish a WEMA to track specific incremental wildfire liability costs effective asof July 26, 2017. The decision does not grant 
the Utility rate recovery of any wildfire-related costs. Any such rate recovery would require CPUC authorization in aseparate proceeding. The Ut
ility may be unable to fully recover costs in excess of insurance, if at all. Rate recovery is uncertain, therefore the Utility has notrecorded a regulatory 
asset related to any wildfire claims costs. Even if such recovery is possible, it could take a number of years to resolve and a number of yearsto collect.
In addition, SB 901, signed into law on Septembe
r 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a customer harm threshold, directing the CPUC to limit certaindisallowances in the aggreg
ate, so that they do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming ratepayers or materially impacting itsability to provide adequa
te and safe service (the “Customer Harm Threshold”). SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery,through the issuance of recov
ery bonds (also referred to as “securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the2017 Northern California wildfi
res, any amounts in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. SB 901 does not authorize securitization with respect to possible2018 Camp fire costs, as the bil
l does not address fires that occurred in 2018.On January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a pro
cess to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the CustomerHarm Threshold in future appl
ications under Section 451.2(a) of the Public Utilities Code for cost recovery of 2017 wildfire costs. In the OIR, the CPUC statedthat “consistent with Sect
ion 451.2(a), the determination of what costs and expenses are just and reasonable must be made in the context of an application for therecovery of specific 
costs related to the 2017 wildfires.” Following the CPUC’s interpretation of Section 451.2 as outlined in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and theUtility believe that 
any securitization of costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires would not occur, if at all, until (a) the Utility has paid claimsrelating to the 2017 Northern Ca
lifornia wildfires, (b) the Utility has filed application for recovery of such costs and (c) the CPUC makes a determination that suchcosts are just and reasonab
le or in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. PG&E Corporation and the Utility therefore do not expect the CPUC to permit theUtility to securitiz
e costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires on an expedited or emergency basis unless the CPUC alters the position expressed inthe OIR.
On February 11, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed opening comments in response to the OIR in which they argued, among other things, the CPUCshould (1) promptly set a Custome
r Harm Threshold, or at least define the methodology for setting the Customer Harm Threshold with sufficient specificity toenable PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity and potential investors to anticipate that amount; (2) determine the Customer Harm Threshold based on the capitalneeded to resolve clai
ms arising from both the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires to be provided for in a plan of reorganization; (3) definehow the Customer Harm Threshold will be 
applied to any future wildfires; and (4) establish the Customer Harm Threshold based on the amount of debt PG&ECorporation and the Utility c
an raise. Based on assumptions set forth in the comments, PG&E Corporation and the Utility indicated that they could borrow up toapproximately 
$3 billion to fund wildfire claims costs as part of a plan of reorganization.Failure to obtain a substant
ial or full recovery of costs related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires or any conclusion that such recovery isno longer probable could have a 
material effect on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.Wildfire-Related Derivativ

ation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation is named as a nominal defendant. The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of fiduciaryduties and unjust enrichmen
t as well as a claim under Section 14(a) of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934 alleging that PG&E Corporation's and theUtility's 2017 proxy statement 
contained misrepresentations regarding the companies' risk management and safety programs. On October 15, 2018, PG&ECorporation filed a motion 
to stay the litigation. The hearing on this motion, previously set for January 31, 2019, was moved by stipulation of the parties and orderof the court to March 7, 2019.

irectors, and naming PG&E Corporation as a nominal defendant.Due to the commencement o
f the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed notices in each of these proceedings on February 1, 2019, reflectingthat the proceedings ar
e automatically stayed pursuant to Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. On February 5, 2019, the plaintiff in Bowlinger
v.
Chew,

ice asserting that the automatic stay did not apply to his claims. The court has not yet acted on the plaintiff’s response.153

Wildfire-Related Securities Class Action LitigationIn June 2018, 
two purported securities class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, naming PG&ECorporation and certain of 
its current and former officers as defendants, entitled David

, respectively.  The compl aints alleged material misrepresentations and omissions related to, among other things, vegetation management andtransmission line safe
ty in various PG&E Corporation public disclosures. The complaints asserted claims under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the federalSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rul
e 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and sought unspecified monetary relief, interest, attorneys' fees and other costs. Bothcomplaints identifi
ed a proposed class period of April 29, 2015 to June 8, 2018. On September 10, 2018, the court consolidated both cases and the litigation is nowdenominated

. The court also appointed the Publ ic Employees Retirement Association of New Mexico as leadplaintiff. The plaint
iff filed a consolidated amended complaint on November 9, 2018. After the plaintiff requested leave to amend their complaint to add allegationsregarding the 2018 Camp fire, 
the plaintiff filed a second amended consolidated complaint on December 14, 2018.Due to the commencement o
f the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a notice on February 1, 2019, reflecting that the proceedings areautomatically stay
ed pursuant to Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. On February 15, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a complaint in BankruptcyCourt against the plai
ntiff seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to extend the stay to the claims alleged against the individual officer defendants.On February 22, 2019, a purported securit
ies class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled York
County on
behalf
of
the
York

Retirement
Fund,
et
al.
v.
Rambo,
et
al
. The complaint names as de fendants certain current and former officers and directors, as wellas the underwriters of 
4 public offerings of notes from 2016 to 2018. Neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility is named as a defendant. The complaint allegesmaterial misrep
resentations and omissions in connection with the note offerings related to, among other things, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s vegetationmanagement and wildfir
e safety measures. The complaint asserts claims under Section 11 and Section 15 of the federal Securities Act of 1933, and seeksunspecified monetary r
elief, attorneys’ fees and other costs, and injunctive relief. If necessary, PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to file a complaint inBankruptcy Court against the pla
intiffs seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to extend the stay to the claims alleged against the individual officerand director defendants.
Clean-up and Repair Costs
The Utility incurred costs o
f $354 million for clean-up and repai r of the Utility’s facilities (including $183 million in capital expenditur es) through December 31,2018, in connection with the 2018 Camp fi
re. The Utility also incurred costs of $ 327 million for clean-up and repai r of the Utility’s facilities (including $ 157 million 
in capital expenditur es) through December 31, 2018, in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. The Utility is authorized to track and seekrecovery of clean-up and 
repair costs through CEMA. (CEMA requests are subject to CPUC approval.) The Utility capitalizes and records as regulatory assetscosts that are probable o
f recovery. At December 31, 2018, the CEMA balance related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires was $ 82 million and is included in long-term regulatory 
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, the capital expenditures for clean-up and repair are included in property, plant andequipment at December 31, 2018.
Should PG&E Corporation and the Utility conc
lude that recovery of any clean-up and repair costs included in the CEMA is no longer probable, PG&E Corporationand the Utility will reco
rd a charge in the period such conclusion is reached. Failure to obtain a substantial or full recovery of these costs or any conclusion thatsuch recovery is no longer probab
le, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, andcash flows.
2015 Butte Fire
In September 2015, a wildfire 
(the “2015 Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California. On April 28, 2016, CalFire released its repo
rt of the investigation of the origin and cause of the 2015 Butte fire. According to Cal Fire’s report, the 2015 Butte fire burned 70,868 acres, resulted in 
two fatalities, destroyed 549 homes, 368 outbuildings and four commercial proper ties, and damaged 44 structures.  Cal Fire’s report concluded that the2015 Butte fire was caused when a gray p
ine tree contacted the Utility’s electric line, which ignited portions of the tree and determined that the failure by theUtility and/or its veget
ation management contractors, ACRT Inc. and Trees, Inc., to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management programultimately led to the failure of
 the tree.154

Third-Party ClaimsOn May 23, 2016, individual plaintiffs 
filed a master complaint against the Utility and its two vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court ofCalifornia, County of Sacramen
to.  Subrogation insurers also filed a separate master complaint on the same date.  The California Judicial Council previously hadauthorized the coordina
tion of all cases in Sacramento County.  As of January 31, 2019, 95 known complaints have been filed against the Utility and its two vegetation managemen
t contractors in the Superior Court of California in the Counties of Calaveras, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Amador.  The complaintsinvolve approximately 
3,900 individual plaintiffs represe nting approximately 2,000 households and their insurance companies.  These complaints are part of, orwere in the process of being add
ed to, the coordinated proceeding.  Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on the doctrine of inversecondemnation and negligenc
e theory of liability.  Plaintiffs also seek punitive damages.  Several plaintiffs dismissed the Utility's two vegetation managementcontractors from the
ir complaints. The Utility does not expect the number of claimants to increase significantly in the future, because the statute of limitations forproperty damage and persona
l injury in connection with the 2015 Butte fire has expired. Further, due to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, theseplaintiffs have been st
ayed from continuing to prosecute pending litigation and from commencing new lawsuits against PG&E Corporation or the Utility onaccount of pre-petit
ion obligations. On January 30, 2019, the Court in the coordinated proceeding issued an order staying the action.On April 28, 2017, the Utility moved for sum
mary adjudication on plaintiffs’ claims for punitive damages.  The court denied the Utility’s motion and the Utilityfiled a writ with the Court of Appe
al of the State of California, Third Appellate District. The writ was granted on July 2, 2018, directing the trial court to entersummary adjudication in 
favor of the Utility and to deny plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages under California Civil Code Section 3294. Plaintiffs soughtrehearing and asked the Cal
ifornia Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeal's decision. Both requests were denied. Neither the trial nor appellate courtsoriginally addressed whethe
r plaintiffs can seek punitive damages at trial under Public Utilities Code Section 2106. However, the trial court, in November 2018,denied a motion filed by th
e Utility that would have confirmed that punitive damages under Public Utilities Code Section 2106 are unavailable. The Utilitybelieves a loss relat
ed to punitive damages is unlikely, but possible.On June 22, 2017, the Superior Court of Californi
a, County of Sacramento ruled on a motion of several plaintiffs and found that the doctrine of inversecondemnation applies to th
e Utility with respect to the 2015 Butte fire. The court held, among other things, that the Utility had failed to put forth any evidence tosupport its contention that 
the CPUC would not allow the Utility to pass on its inverse condemnation liability through rate increases. While the ruling is bindingonly between the Utility and th
e plaintiffs in the coordination proceeding at the time of the ruling, others could make similar claims. On January 4, 2018, the Utilityfiled with the court a r
enewed motion for a legal determination of inverse condemnation liability, citing the November 30, 2017 CPUC decision denying the SanDiego Gas & Electric Company appl
ication to recover wildfire costs in excess of insurance, and the CPUC declaration that it will not automatically allow utilitiesto spread inverse condemna
tion losses through rate increases.On May 1, 2018, the Superior Court of Californi
a, County of Sacramento issued its ruling on the Utility’s renewed motion in which the court affirmed, with minorchanges, its tentative 
ruling dated April 25, 2018. The court determined that it is bound by earlier holdings of two appellate courts decisions, Barham
 and PacificBell
. Further, the court stated that the Utility's constitutional arguments should be made to the appellate courts and suggested that, to the extent the Utility raisesthe public policy impli
cations of the November 30, 2017 CPUC decision in the San Diego Gas & Electric Company cost recovery proceeding, these argumentsshould be addressed to the Legisl
ature or CPUC. The Utility filed a writ with the Court of Appeal seeking immediate review of the court's decision. On June 18,2018, after the writ was summa
rily denied, the Utility filed a Petition for Review with the California Supreme Court, which also was denied. On September 6,2018, the court set a tria
l for some individual plaintiffs to begin on April 1, 2019. The Utility reached agreement with two plaintiffs in the litigation to stipulate tojudgment against the Util
ity on inverse condemnation grounds. The court granted the Utility's stipulated judgment motion on November 29, 2018 and the Utilityfiled its appeal on Dece
mber 11, 2018. As a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, these lawsuits, including the trial and the appeal from the stipulatedjudgment, are stayed.
In addition to the coordina
ted plaintiffs, Cal Fire, the California Office of Emergency Services (the “OES”), the County of Calaveras, and five smaller publicentities ( 
three fire districts, one water district and the California Department of Veterans Affairs) have brought suit or indicated that they intend to do so. The five smaller public enti
ties filed their complaints in August 2018 and September 2018. They have been added to the coordinated proceedings. The Utility has settled theclaims of the three fire protectio
n districts.155

On April 13, 2017, Cal Fire filed a complaint with the Superior Court of California, County of Calaveras, seeking to recover over $ 87 million for its costs incurred on the theory that the Util
ity and its vegetation management contractors were negligent, or violated the law, among other claims.  On July 31, 2017, Cal Firedismissed its complaint 
against Trees, Inc., one of the Utility's vegetation contractors. Cal Fire had requested that a trial of its claims be set in 2019, following anytrial of the clai
ms of the individual plaintiffs. On October 19, 2018, the Utility filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that Cal Fire cannot recover any firesuppression costs under the Third Dist
rict Court of Appeal's decision in Dep't
of
Forestry
&
Fire
Prot.
v.
Howell
 (2017) 18 Cal. App. 5th 154. The hearing on that motion was set for January 31, 2019, but th
e hearing and Cal Fire’s case against the Utility are now stayed. Prior to the stay, the Utility and Cal Fire were alsoengaged in a mediation pro
cess.Also, on February 20, 2018, the County of Calaveras f
iled suit against the Utility and the Utility’s vegetation management contractors to recover damages andother costs, based on the doctr
ine of inverse condemnation and negligence theory of liability. The County also sought punitive damages. On March 2, 2018, theCounty served a mediation dem
and seeking in excess of $ 167 million , having previously indicated that it intended to bring an approximately $ 85 million claim against the Utility. This c
laim included costs that the County of Calaveras allegedly incurred or expected to incur for infrastructure damage, erosion control, andother costs. The Utility and th
e County of Calaveras settled the County's claims in November 2018 for $ 25.4 million . Further, in May 2017, the OES indicated th
at it intended to bring a claim against the Utility that it estimated to be approximately $ 190 million .  This claim would include costs incurred by th
e OES for tree and debris removal, infrastructure damage, erosion control, and other claims related to the 2015 Butte fire. The Utilityhas not received any infor
mation or documentation from OES since its May 2017 statement. In June 2017, the Utility entered into an agreement with the OES thatextends their deadline 
to file a claim to December 2020.PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's oblig
ations with respect to such outstanding claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process.Estimated Losses from Third-Party Claims
In connection with the 2015 Butte f
ire, the Utility may be liable for property damages, business interruption, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having beenfound negligent, through the doct
rine of inverse condemnation. In addition, the Utility m
ay be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility is found to have been negligent.  Whilethe Utility believes i
t was not negligent, there can be no assurance that a court would agree with the Utility. The Utility’s assessment of 
the estimated loss related to the 2015 Butte fire is based on assumptions about the number, size, and type of structures damaged ordestroyed, the contents of such s
tructures, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, as well as assumptions about personal injury damages, attorneys’fees, fire suppression costs, 
and certain other damages.The Utility has determin
ed that it is probable that it will incur a loss of $ 1.1 billion in connection with the 2015 Butte f ire. While this amount includes the Utility'sassumptions about fire suppress
ion costs (including its assessment of the Cal Fire loss), it does not include any portion of the estimated claim from the OES. TheUtility still does not
 have sufficient information to reasonably estimate any liability it may have for that additional claim.The process for estimat
ing costs associated with claims relating to the 2015 Butte fire requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number ofassumptions and subjective f
actors.  As more information becomes known, management estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the 2015Butte fire may result 
in material increases to the loss accrued.156

sses in connection with claims relating to the 2015 Butte fire that materially exceed the amount the Utility accrued for these liabilities,PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the reporting periodsduring which additional charg
es are recorded.Loss Recoveries
The Utility has liabili
ty insurance from various insurers, that provides coverage for third-party liability attributable to the 2015 Butte fire in an aggregate amount of$ 
922 million .  The Utility records insuran ce recoveries when it is deemed probable that a recovery will occur and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amountor its range.  Through 
December 31, 2018 , the Utility recorded $ 922 million for probable insurance r ecoveries in connection with losses related to the 2015 Buttefire.  While the Util
ity plans to seek recovery of all insured losses, it is unable to predict the ultimate amount and timing of such insurance recoveries.  In addition,the Utility has receiv
ed $ 60 million in cumulative reimbursements fr om the insurance policies of its vegetation management contractors (excluded from the tablebelow), including $ 
7 million received in the year ended December 31, 2018 . Recoveries of additional amounts under the insurance policies of the Utility’svegetation managemen

NOTE 14: OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTSPG&E Corporation and the Utility have s
ignificant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to enforcement and litigationmatters and environmen
tal remediation.  A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of theloss can be reasonably esti
mated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lowerend of the range, unless an amoun
t within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonablypossible, and whether the loss or a 
range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies are reviewedquarterly and estima
tes are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice oflegal counsel, and other in
formation and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s policy is to exclude anticipated legal costsfrom the provision for loss and 
expense these costs as incurred. The Utility also has substantial financial commitments in connection with agreements entered intoto support its operating ac
tivities.  See “Purchase Commitments” below.  PG&E Corporation has financial commitments described in “Other Commitments”below.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the outcome of thefollowing matters.
Enforcement Matters
In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Franc
isco and the California Attorney General's office opened investigations into matters related to allegedlyimproper communicat
ion between the Utility and CPUC personnel.  The Utility has cooperated with those investigations.  It is uncertain whether any charges willbe brought against the Utili
ty. Such proceedings are not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases; however,collection efforts 
in connection with fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.CPUC and FERC Matters
Order Instituting an Investigation and Order to Show Cause into the Utility's Locate and Mark prac
ticesOn December 14, 2018, the CPUC issued an OII and order to show caus
e (the "OII") to assess the Utility's practices and procedures related to the locating andmarking of natural gas f
acilities. The OII directs the Utility to show cause as to why the Commission should not find violations in this matter, and why theCommission should not impose penalt
ies, and/or any other forms of relief, if any violations are found. The Utility also is directed in the OII to provide a report onspecific matters, 
including that it is conducting locate and mark programs in a safe manner.The OII cites a report by th
e SED dated December 6, 2018, which alleges that the Utility violated the law pertaining to the locating and marking of its gas facilitiesand falsified records 
related to its locate and mark activities between 2012 and 2017. As described in the OII, the SED cites reports issued in this matter by twoconsultants retained by th
e Utility, that (i) included certain facts and conclusions about the extent of inaccuracies in the Utility’s late tickets and the reasons for theinaccuracies, and (i
i) provided the Utility’s late tickets counts, and identification of associated dig-ins. As a result, the OII will determine whether the Utilityviolated any provision of the Publ
ic Utilities Code, general orders, federal law adopted by California, other rules, or requirements, and/or other state or federal law,by its locate and mark pol
icies, practices, and related issues, and the extent to which the Utility’s practices with regard to locate and mark may have diminishedsystem safety.
The CPUC indicates that it has not conc
luded that the Utility has violated the law in any instance pertaining to late tickets, locating and marking, or any matterrelated to either, o
r to any other matter raised in this OII. However, if violations are found, the CPUC will consider what monetary fines and other remedies areappropriate, will revi
ew the duration of violations and, if supported by the evidence, it will consider ordering daily fines.On January 14, 2019, the Utility submitt
ed responses to preliminary questions raised in the OII and separately filed an affidavit regarding the safety of the locateand mark program. On March 14, 2019, as di
rected by the CPUC, the Utility expects to submit a report that addresses the SED report and respond to the order toshow cause. A schedule for future pro
ceedings is expected to be established at an April 5, 2019 pre-hearing conference.PG&E Corporation and the Utility bel
ieve it is probable that the CPUC will impose penalties, including fines or other remedies, on the Utility. The Utility is unableto reasonably estimat
e the amount or range of future charges that could be incurred given the CPUC's wide discretion and the number of factors that can beconsidered in determin
ing penalties. The Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of this proceeding.158

Such proceedings are likely not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases; however, collection efforts inconnection with fines or pena
lties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.Order Instituting an Investigation into Compliance with Ex Parte Communicat
ion RulesDuring 2014 and 2015, the Utility filed s
everal reports to notify the CPUC of communications that the Utility believes may have constituted or described ex partecommunications that e
ither should not have occurred or that should have been timely reported to the CPUC.  Ex parte communications include communicationsbetween a decision maker 
and interested persons concerning substantive issues in certain formal proceedings.  Certain communications are prohibited and othersare permissible with prop
er noticing and reporting.On November 23, 2015, the CPUC issued an OII into whether the Uti
lity should be sanctioned for violating rules pertaining to ex parte communications and Rule1.1 of the CPUC’s Rules of Practice and Procedur
e governing the conduct of those appearing before the CPUC.  The OII cites some of the communications theUtility reported to the CPUC.  The OII also 
cites the ex parte violations alleged in the City of San Bruno’s July 2014 motion, which it filed in CPUC investigationsrelated to the Utili
ty’s natural gas transmission pipeline operations and practices.On April 26, 2018, the CPUC approved the revised proposed dec
ision issued on April 3, 2018, adopting the settlement agreement jointly submitted to the CPUC onMarch 28, 2017, as modified (the "s
ettlement agreement") by the Utility, the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos, Cal PA, the SED, and TURN.The decision results in a to
tal penalty of $97.5 million comprised of: (1) a $12 million payment to the Californi a General Fund,(2) forgoing collection o
f $63.5 million of GT&S revenue requirements for the years 2018 ( $31.75 million ) and 2019 ( $31.75 million ), (3) a $10 million one- time revenue requir
ement adjustment to be amortized in equivalent annual amounts over the Utility’s next GRC cycle (i.e., the 2020 GRC), and (4) compensationpayments to the Cities of San Bruno and San Ca
rlos in a total amount of $12 million ( $6 million to each city). In addit ion, the settlement agreement provides forcertain non-financi
al remedies, including enhanced noticing obligations between the Utility and CPUC decision-makers, as well as certification of employeetraining on the CPUC ex parte communi
cation rules. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, customers will bear no costs associated with the financialremedies set forth above.
As a result of the CPUC's April 26, 2018 decision, on May 17, 2018, the Ut
ility made a $12 million payment to the Californi a General Fund and $6 million payments to each of the Cit
ies of San Bruno and San Carlos. At December 31, 2018, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include a$32 million 
accrual for a portion o f the 2018 GT&S revenue requirement reduction. In accordance with accounting rules, adjustments related to revenuerequirements are r
ecorded in the periods in which they are incurred.The CPUC also ordered a second phase in this pro
ceeding to determine if any of the additional communications that the Utility reported to the CPUC on September21, 2017, violate the CPUC ex parte rules. On May 22, 2018, th
e assigned ALJ issued a ruling requiring the parties to meet and confer to determine if an agreementcan be reached on the issues 
identified by the ALJ. On September 17, 2018, the parties submitted a joint status report indicating a settlement in principle could notbe reached. The ALJ will hold a preh
earing conference with the parties to determine if evidentiary hearings are required. The Utility is unable to predict the timingand outcome of the second phase 
in this proceeding.Such proceedings are likely no
t subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases; however, collection efforts inconnection with fines or pena
lties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.Transmission Owner Rate Case Revenue Subject to Refund
The FERC determines the amount of au
thorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect inrates in the TO rate cas
e. The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on the requested revenue requirement, subject to refund, before theFERC has issued a final decision. The Util
ity bills and records revenue based on the amounts requested in its rate case filing and records a reserve for its estimateof the amounts that are p
robable of refund. Rates subject to refund went into effect on March 1, 2017, and March 1, 2018, for TO18 and TO19, respectively. Ratessubject to refund for TO20 will go in
to effect on May 1, 2019.159

On October 1, 2018, the ALJ issued an initial decision in the TO18 rate case and the Utility filed initial briefs on October 31, 2018, in response to the ALJ'srecommendations. The Util
ity expects the FERC to issue a decision in the TO18 rate case by mid-2019, however, that decision will likely be the subject of requestsfor rehearing and appea
l. The Utility is unable to predict the timing of when a final decision will be issued. On September 21, 2018, the Utility filed an all-partysettlement with FERC in connection wi
th TO19. As part of the settlement, the TO19 revenue requirement will be set at 98.85% of the revenue require ment forTO18 that will be determined 
in the TO18 final decision. The Utility is unable to predict the timing or outcome of FERC’s decisions in these proceedings.Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline Rights-of-Way   
In 2012, the Utility notified 
the CPUC and the SED that the Utility planned to complete a system-wide survey of its transmission pipelines in an effort to address aself-reported viola
tion whereby the Utility did not properly identify encroachments (such as building structures and vegetation overgrowth) on the Utility’s pipelinerights-of-way. The Utility a
lso submitted a proposed compliance plan that set forth the scope and timing of remedial work to remove identified encroachments overa multi-year period 
and to pay penalties if the proposed milestones were not met. In March 2014, the Utility informed the SED that the survey had been completedand that remediation work, 
including removal of the encroachments, was expected to continue for several years. The SED has not addressed the Utility’s proposedcompliance plan, and it 
is reasonably possible that the SED will impose fines on the Utility in the future based on the Utility’s failure to continuously survey itssystem and remove encroa
chments. The Utility is unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of future charges that could be incurred given the SED’s widediscretion and the number o
f factors that can be considered in determining penalties.Other Matters
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to various claims, lawsuits and regulatory proceedings that separately are not considered material.  Accruals forcontingencies relat
ed to such matters (excluding amounts related to the contingencies discussed in Note 13 and above under “Enforcement and Litigation Matters”)totaled 
$98 million at December 31, 2018 and $86 million at December 31, 2017 .  These amounts are included in Other current liabilities in the ConsolidatedBalance Sheets.  PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility do not believe it is reasonably possible that the resolution of these matters will have a material effect on theirfinancial condition, r
esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.2015 GT&S Rate Case Disallowance of Capital Expenditures
On June 23, 2016, the CPUC approved a final phase one decis
ion in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case.  The phase one decision excluded from rate base $696 million 
of capital spending in 2011 through 2014 in excess of the amount adopted in the prior GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed $120 million of that amount and ordered 
that the remaining $576 million be subject to an audit overs een by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seekrecovery in a future pro
ceeding. The decision also established various cost caps that will increase the risk of overspend over the current rate case cycle includingnew one-way balancing accounts. As a r
esult, in 2016, the Utility incurred charges of $219 million for capital expenditu res that the Utility believes are probable ofdisallowance based on the dec
ision. This included $134 million for 2011 through 2014 capital expend itures in excess of adopted amounts and $44 million for the Utility’s estimate o
f 2015 through 2018 capital expenditures that are probable of exceeding authorized amounts. The Utility would be required to take a charge inthe future if the CPUC's audit of 2011 through 2014 
capital spending resulted in additional permanent disallowance. The audit is still in process.160

Environmental Remediation ContingenciesGiven the complexities of 
the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process forestimating remediation liabilities req
uires significant judgment. The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when the site assessments indicate thatremediation is probabl
e and the Utility can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of probable amounts. The Utility records an environmental remediation liabilitybased on the lower end of the rang
e of estimated probable costs, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Key factors thatinform the development of
 estimated costs include site feasibility studies and investigations, applicable remediation actions, operations and maintenance activities,post-remediation moni
toring, and the cost of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site. Amounts recorded are not discounted to theirpresent value. The Utility
’s environmental remediation liability is primarily included in non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is comprisedof the following:

Primarily driven by the San Francisco Potrero Power Plant.The Utility’s gas compressor s
tations, former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, and sites used by the Utility for the storage,recycling, and disposal of pot
entially hazardous substances are subject to requirements issued by the EPA under the Federal Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct in addition to other sta
te hazardous waste laws.  The Utility has a comprehensive program in place designed to comply with federal, state, and local laws andregulations related 
to hazardous materials, waste, remediation activities, and other environmental requirements.  The Utility assesses and monitors theenvironmental requir
ements on an ongoing basis, and implements changes to its program as deemed appropriate. The Utility’s remediation activities are overseenby the DTSC, several California reg
ional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.The Utility’s environme
ntal remediation liability at December 31, 2018 , reflects its best es timate of probable future costs for remediation based on the currentassessment data and regul
atory obligations. Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work necessary to implement final remediation plansand the Utility's time frame
 for remediation.  The Utility may incur actual costs in the future that are materially different than this estimate and such costs couldhave a material e
ffect on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows during the period in which they are recorded. At December 31, 2018 , the Utility expected to 
recover $930 million of its environmental  remediation liability for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms authorized by theCPUC. 
Natural Gas Compressor Station Sites
The Utility is legally r
esponsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gascompressor stations. The Util
ity is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment.161

Topock SiteThe Utility’s remedia
tion and abatement efforts at the Topock site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California DTSC and the U.S. Department of theInterior. On April 24, 2018, the DTSC authorized 
the Utility to build an in-situ groundwater treatment system to convert hexavalent chromium into a non-toxic andnon-soluble form of chromiu
m. Construction activities began in October 2018 and will continue for several years. The Utility’s undiscounted future costsassociated with the Topock sit
e may increase by as much as $303 million if the extent of co ntamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. Thecosts associated with environ
mental remediation at the Topock site are expected to be recovered primarily through the HSM, where 90% of the costs are recovered in rates.
Hinkley Site
The Utility has been imple
menting remediation measures at the Hinkley site to reduce the mass of the chromium plume in groundwater and to monitor and controlmovement of the plume. The Ut
ility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California Regional WaterQuality Control Board, Lahontan Region. In Novemb
er 2015, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region adopted a clean-up andabatement order directing the 
Utility to contain and remediate the underground plume of hexavalent chromium and the potential environmental impacts. The finalorder states that the Ut
ility must continue and improve its remediation efforts, define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take other action. Additionally,the final order sets plu
me capture requirements, requires a monitoring and reporting program, and includes deadlines for the Utility to meet interim cleanup targets.The United States Geological Survey 
team is currently conducting a background study on the site to better define the chromium plume boundaries. The backgroundstudy is expected to be fina
lized in 2019. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Hinkley site may increase by as much as $141 million if the extent of contaminat
ion or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation at the Hinkley site will not berecovered through rates.
Former Manufactured Gas Plants
Former MGPs used coal and oil to produce g
as for use by the Utility’s customers before natural gas became available. The by-products and residues of this processwere often disposed of at the MGPs the
mselves. The Utility has undertaken a program to manage the residues left behind as a result of the manufacturing process;many of the sites in the prog
ram have been addressed. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with MGP sites may increase by as much as $518 million if the extent of contaminatio
n or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation at the MGP sites arerecovered through the HSM, where 
90% of the costs are recove red in rates.Utility-Owned Generation Facilities and Third-Part
y Disposal SitesUtility-owned generation f
acilities and third-party disposal sites often involve long-term remediation. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated withUtility-owned generation f
acilities and third-party disposal sites may increase by as much as $135 million if the exten t of contamination or necessary remediationis greater than anticipated. 
The environmental remediation costs associated with the Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites are recoveredthrough the HSM, where 
90% of the costs are recove red in rates.162

Fossil Fuel-Fired Generation SitesIn 1998, the Utility divested i
ts generation power plant business as part of generation deregulation. Although the Utility sold its fossil-fueled power plants, theUtility retained the 
environmental remediation liability associated with each site. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with fossil fuel-fired generationsites may increase by as 
much as $105 million if the extent of co ntamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The environmental remediationcosts associated with the foss
il fuel-fired sites will not be recovered through rates.Insurance
Wildfire Insurance
In 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility r
enewed their liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 billion for the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, co
mprised of $700 million for general liability (subject t o an initial self-insured retention of  $10 million  per occurrence), and 
$700 million for property damages only, which p roperty damage coverage includes an aggregate amount of approximately $200 million through the reinsurance
 market where a catastrophe bond was utilized. Various coverage limitations applicable to different insurance layers could result insubstantial uninsured costs in 
the future depending on the amount and type of damages.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
cost of obtaining wildfire insurance coverage has increased to $360 million , compared to the adopted app roximately $50 million 
that the Utility is cur rently recovering through rates through December 31, 2019. The Utility intends to seek recovery for the full amount of premium costspaid in excess of the amount 
the Utility currently is recovering from customers through the end of the current GRC period, which ends on December 31, 2019.Nuclear Insurance
The Utility is a member o
f NEIL, which is a mutual insurer owned by utilities with nuclear facilities.  NEIL provides insurance coverage for property damages andbusiness interruption losses in
curred by the Utility if a nuclear event were to occur at the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retiredHumboldt Bay Unit 3. NEIL provides property dam
age and business interruption coverage of up to $3.2 billion per nuclear incident and $2.6 billion per non- nuclear incident for Di
ablo Canyon.  Humboldt Bay Unit 3 has up to $131 million of coverage for nuclea r and non-nuclear property damages.NEIL also provides coverage for d
amages caused by acts of terrorism at nuclear power plants.  Certain acts of terrorism may be “certified” by the Secretary of theTreasury.  If damages ar
e caused by certified acts of terrorism, NEIL can obtain reimbursement from the federal government up to a shared limit of $3.2 billion for each insured loss for NEIL memb
ers.  In contrast, for acts of terrorism not deemed "certified" by the Secretary of the Treasury, NEIL treats all non-certifiedterrorist acts occu
rring within a 12-month period against one or more commercial nuclear power plants insured by NEIL as one event and the owners of theaffected plants would shar
e a $3.2 billion policy limit amount. In addition to the nuclea
r insurance the Utility maintains through the NEIL, the Utility also is a member of the EMANI, which provides excess insurance coveragefor property damages and busin
ess interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur at Diablo Canyon. EMANI provides$200 million 
for any one accident and in the annual aggregate excess of the combined amount recoverable under the Utility’s NEIL policiesIf NEIL losses in any policy year 
exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment.  If NEIL were to exercise this assessment,as of 
December 31, 2018 , the current maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation for the Utility would be approximately $47 million .  If EMANI losses in any policy year exce
ed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment of approximately $3 million , as of December 31, 2018 
.   Under the Price-Anderson Act, public 
liability claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur at Diablo Canyon, and that occur during the transportation ofmaterial to and fro
m Diablo Canyon are limited to $14.1 billion .  The Utility purc hased the maximum available public liability insurance of $450 million for Diablo Canyon.  The balance of the 
$14.1 billion of liability protec tion is provided under a loss-sharing program among utilities owning nuclear reactors.  TheUtility may be assessed up to 
$275 million per nuclear incident und er this program, with payments in each year limited to a maximum of $41 million per incident. Both the maximum asse
ssment and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years . 163

The Price-Anderson Act does not apply to claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur during shipping of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel enricher to afuel fabricator or that occur at
 the fuel fabricator’s facility.  The Utility has a separate policy that provides coverage for claims arising from some of these incidentsup to a maximum of 
$450 million per incident.  In addition, the Utility has $53 million of liability insuranc e for Humboldt Bay Unit 3 and has a $500 million indemnification fro
m the NRC for public liability arising from nuclear incidents for Humboldt Bay Unit 3, covering liabilities in excess of the $53 million in liability insurance.
Resolution of Remaining 2001 Chapter 11 Disputed Claims
Various electricity supp
liers filed claims in the Utility’s 2001 prior proceeding filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking payment for energysupplied to the Utility’s cus
tomers between May 2000 and June 2001.  While the FERC and judicial proceedings are pending, the Utility pursued settlements withelectricity suppli
ers and entered into a number of settlement agreements with various electricity suppliers to resolve some of these disputed claims and to resolvethe Utility’s refund cl
aims against these electricity suppliers. Under these settlement agreements, amounts payable by the parties, in some instances, would besubject to adjustment bas
ed on the outcome of the various refund offset and interest issues being considered by the FERC. Generally, any net refunds, claimoffsets, or other credi
ts that the Utility receives from electricity suppliers either through settlement or through the conclusion of the various FERC and judicialproceedings are refunded 
to customers through rates in future periods.At 
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , respectively, the Consolida ted Balance Sheets reflected $ 220 million and $ 243 million in net claims withinDisputed claims and custome
r refunds related to the 2001 Chapter 11 proceeding.  The Utility's obligations with respect to such claims (all of which arose prior tothe initiation of the Ut
ility's pending Chapter 11 Case on January 29, 2019), including pursuant to any prior settlements relating thereto, are expected to bedetermined through the pro
ceedings of the Chapter 11 Cases.Purchase Commitments

Third-Party Power Purchase Agreements
In the ordinary course of busin
ess, the Utility enters into various agreements, including renewable energy agreements, QF agreements, and other power purchaseagreements to purchase powe
r and electric capacity.  The price of purchased power may be fixed or variable.  Variable pricing is generally based on the currentmarket price of either natural ga
s or electricity at the date of delivery.164

Renewable
Energy
Power
Purchase
Agreements.

 In order to comply with Califo rnia’s RPS requirements, the Utility is required to deliver renewable energy to itscustomers at a gradual
ly increasing rate.  The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase renewable energy to help meet California’s requirement. TheUtility’s obligations under 
a significant portion of these agreements are contingent on the third party’s construction of new generation facilities, which are expectedto grow.  As of 
December 31, 2018 , renewable energy contra cts expire at various dates between 2019 and 2043 . Conventional
Energy
Power
Purchase
Agreements.

The Utility has entered in to many power purchase agreements for conventional generation resources, whichinclude tolling agree
ments and resource adequacy agreements.  The Utility’s obligation under a portion of these agreements is contingent on the third parties’development of new generat
ion facilities to provide capacity and energy products to the Utility. As of December 31, 2018 , these power purchase agree mentsexpire at various dates b
etween 2019 and 2033 . Other
Power
Purchase
Agreements.

The Utility has entered in to agreements to purchase energy and capacity with independent power producers that owngeneration facilities that meet the 
definition of a QF under federal law.  Two of these agreements are treated as capital leases.  At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , net capital leases 
reflected in property, plant, and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $11 million and $18 million including accumulated amortization of 
$8 million and $143 million , respectively.  The presen t value of the future minimum lease payments due under these agreements included $2 million 
and $11 million in Current Liabilities and $9 million and $7 million in Noncurrent Liabiliti es on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively. As ofDecember 31, 2018 
, QF contracts in operation expi re at various dates between 2019 and 2049 .  In addition, the Utility has agreements with various irrigationdistricts and water agen
cies to purchase hydroelectric power.The costs incurred for al
l power purchases and electric capacity amounted to $3.1 billion in 2018 , $3.3 billion in 2017 , and $3.5 billion in 2016 . Natural Gas Supply, Transportation, and Storage Commitments 
The Utility purchases natur
al gas directly from producers and marketers in both Canada and the United States to serve its core customers and to fuel its owned-generation facili
ties.  The Utility also contracts for natural gas transportation from the points at which the Utility takes delivery (typically in Canada, the US RockyMountain supply area, and the southwes
tern United States) to the points at which the Utility’s natural gas transportation system begins.  These agreements expire atvarious dates between 
2019 and 2026 .  In addition, the Utility has contracted for natural gas storage services in northern California to more reliably meetcustomers’ loads.
Costs incurred for natural g
as purchases, natural gas transportation services, and natural gas storage, which include contracts with terms of less than 1 year,amounted to 
$0.6 billion in 2018 , $0.9 billion in 2017 , and $0.7 billion in 2016 . Nuclear Fuel Agreements
The Utility has entered in
to several purchase agreements for nuclear fuel.  These agreements expire at various dates between 2019 and 2024 and are intended to ensure long-term nucle
ar fuel supply.  The Utility relies on a number of international producers of nuclear fuel in order to diversify its sources and provide securityof supply.  Pricing terms are 
also diversified, ranging from market-based prices to base prices that are escalated using published indices. Payments for nuclear fue
l amounted to $73 million in 2018 , $83 million in 2017 , and $100 million in 2016 . 165

Other CommitmentsPG&E Corporation and the Utility have o
ther commitments related to operating leases (primarily office facilities and land), which expire at various dates between2019 
and 2052 .  At December 31, 2018 , the future minimum payme nts related to these commitments were as follows:(in millions)

uses requiring annual increases in rent.  The rentals payable under these leases may increase by a fixed amount each year, apercentage of incre
ase over base year, or the consumer price index.  Most leases contain extension operations ranging between one and five years . NOTE 15: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Chapter 11 Proceedings
On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. PG&E Corporation's and theUtility’s Chapter 11 Cases are b
eing jointly administered under the caption In re: PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Case No. 19-30088(DM).
PG&E Corporation and the Utility cont
inue to operate their businesses as debtors in possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordancewith applicable provisions of 
the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. As debtors in possession, PG&E Corporation and the Utility areauthorized to continue to op
erate as ongoing businesses, and may pay all debts and honor all obligations arising in the ordinary course of their businesses after thePetition Date. However, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility may not pay third-party claims or creditors on account of obligations arising before the Petition Date orengage in transactions outs
ide the ordinary course of business without approval of the Bankruptcy Court.Under the Bankruptcy Code, third-par
ty actions to collect pre-petition indebtedness owed by PG&E Corporation or the Utility, as well as most litigation pendingagainst PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity (including the third-party matters described in Note 13 above), are subject to an automatic stay. Absent an order of theBankruptcy Court providing otherwise, subst
antially all pre-petition liabilities will be administered under a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization to be voted upon bycreditors and other stak
eholders, and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. However, under the Bankruptcy Code, regulatory or criminal proceedings are generallynot subject to an automat
ic stay, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect these proceedings to continue during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.To assure ordinary course oper
ations, on January 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility received interim approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of“first day” motions, inc
luding motions that authorize them to maintain their existing cash management system, to continue wage and salary payments and otherbenefits to their emp
loyees, to secure debtor in possession financing and other customary relief. On February 27, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility receivedfinal approval of the f
irst day motion to continue wage and salary payments and other benefits to their employees (with one limited objection with respect to adiscrete matter h
aving been preserved by the Bankruptcy Court) and certain other first day motions for customary relief. Hearings on certain other first daymotions, including a hearing 
to consider final approval of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s motions to continue their existing cash management system and toapprove their debtor in possess
ion financing, have not been held and no assurances can be given that the Bankruptcy Court will approve such motions on a finalbasis. PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
are unable to predict the date of the final hearing with respect to such motions, but there are hearings currently scheduledfor March 12, March 13 and March 27, 2019.
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cas
es, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. See Note 4 above for a description of the DIPCredit Agreement.
The commencement of the 
Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default or termination event, and caused an automatic and immediate acceleration of theAccelerated Direct Fin
ancial Obligations. Accordingly, as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the principal amount of the Accelerated DirectFinancial Obligations, togeth
er with accrued interest thereon, and in case of certain indebtedness, premium, if any, thereon, immediately became due and payable.However, any efforts to enforc
e such payment obligations are automatically stayed as of the Petition Date, and are subject to the applicable provisions of theBankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankrupt
cy Court. The material Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations include the outstanding senior notes, agreements inrespect of certain s
eries of pollution control bonds, and PG&E Corporation's term loan facility, as well as short-term borrowings under PG&E Corporation's andthe Utility's revolving cr
edit facilities and the Utility's term loan facility disclosed in Note 4 above. The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases may also provide thecounterparties under c
ertain commodity and related agreements with the right to declare an event of default and to seek termination of such rights subject to theapplicable provisions of th
e Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.Under the priority scheme 
established by the Bankruptcy Code, certain post-petition and secured or “priority” pre-petition liabilities need to be satisfied beforegeneral unsecured cred
itors and holders of PG&E Corporation's and the Utility’s equity are entitled to receive any distribution. No assurance can be given as towhat values, if any, will be asc
ribed in the Chapter 11 Cases to the claims and interests of each of these constituencies. Additionally, no assurance can be given asto whether, when or in what form unsecu
red creditors and holders of PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s equity may receive a distribution on such claims orinterests.

Under the Bankruptcy Code, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases,including, without limita
tion, leases of real property and equipment, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and to certain other conditions. Anydescription of an executo
ry contract or unexpired lease in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, where applicable, the express termination rights thereunderor a quantification of 
their obligations, must be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by, any overriding rejection rights PG&E Corporation and the Utility haveunder the Bankruptcy Code.
As of February 28, 2019, the Utility had outst
anding borrowings of $ 350 million under the DIP Revolving Facility and $30 million in face amount of outstand ingletters of credit, with remaini
ng availability of $ 1.12 billion under the DIP Revolving Facility. US District Court Matters and Probation
On August 9, 2016, the jury in the federal 
criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in SanFrancisco, found the Utility gui
lty on one count of obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity managementregulations of the Natura
l Gas Pipeline Safety Act. On January 26, 2017, the court issued a judgment of conviction against the Utility. The court sentenced theUtility to a 
5 -year corporate probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after 3 years, a fine of 
$3 million to be paid to the federa l government, certain advertising requirements, and community service.The probation includes a requ
irement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the probation, the Utilityhas retained a third-p
arty monitor at the Utility’s expense. The goal of the third-party monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriatesteps to maintain the safet
y of its gas and electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive programs on a Utility-widebasis.
On November 27, 2018, the court overseeing 
the Utility’s probation, issued an order requiring that the Utility, the United States Attorney’s Office for the NorthernDistrict of California 
(the “USAO”) and the third-party monitor provide written answers to a series of questions regarding the Utility’s compliance with the termsof its probation, including what 
requirements of the Utility’s probation “might be implicated were any wildfire started by reckless operation or maintenance ofPG&E power lines” or “might be imp
licated by any inaccurate, slow, or failed reporting of information about any wildfire by PG&E.”  The court also ordered theUtility to provide “an ac
curate and complete statement of the role, if any, of PG&E in causing and reporting the recent 2018 Camp fire in Butte County and allother wildfires in Califo
rnia” since January 2017 (“Question 4 of the November 27 Order”).  On December 5, 2018, the court issued an order requesting that theOffice of the Californi
a Attorney General advise the court of its view on “the extent to which, if at all, the reckless operation or maintenance of PG&E power lineswould constitute a crime und
er California law.”  The responses of the Attorney General were submitted on December 28, 2018, and the responses of the Utility, theUSAO and the third-party monitor were sub
mitted on December 31, 2018.On January 3, 2019, the court issued a new orde
r requiring that the Utility provide further information regarding the Atlas fire.  The court noted that “[t]his orderpostpones the question of the adequ
acy of PG&E’s response” to Question 4 of the November 27 Order.  On January 4, 2019, the court issued another orderrequiring that the Util
ity provide “with respect to each of the eighteen October 2017 Northern California wi ldfires that [Cal Fire] has attributed to [the Utility’s]facilities,” info
rmation regarding the wind conditions in the vicinity of each fire’s origin and information about the equipment allegedly involved in each fire’signition.  The responses of the Uti
lity were submitted on January 10, 2019.167

On January 9, 2019, the court ordered the Utility to appear in court on January 30, 2019, as a result of the court’s finding that “there is probable cause to believethere has been a violat
ion of the conditions of supervision” with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire.  In addition, on January 9, 2019,the court issued an order (
the “January 9 Order”) proposing to add new conditions of probation that would require the Utility, among other things, to:•
prior to June 21, 2019, “re-inspect all of its electrical grid and remove or trim all trees that could fall onto its power lines, poles or equipment in high-windconditions, . . . identify and fix 
all conductors that might swing together and arc due to slack and/or other circumstances under high-wind conditions[,]identify and fix damaged o
r weakened poles, transformers, fuses and other connectors [and] identify and fix any other condition anywhere in its gridsimilar to any condition 
that contributed to any previous wildfires”,•
“document the foregoing inspections and the work done and . . . rate each segment’s safety under various wind conditions” and•
at all times from and after June 21, 2019, “supply electricity only through those parts of its electrical grid it has determined to be safe under the windconditions then prevailing.”
The Utility was ordered to show cause by J
anuary 23, 2019, as to why the Utility’s conditions of probation should not be modified as proposed. The Utility'sresponse was submitted on January 23, 2019. The 
court requested that Cal Fire file a public statement, and invited the CPUC to comment, by January 25, 2019. OnJanuary 30, 2019, the court found that 
the Utility had violated a condition of its probation with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire.The court issued an order sta
ting that a sentencing hearing on the probation violation will be set at a later date. The court also invited parties to comment byFebruary 20, 2019, on the 2019 Wildfire Sa
fety Plan that the Utility submitted to the CPUC on February 6, 2019.168

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGManagement of PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financialreporting and the prepar
ation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Internal controlover financial reporting incl
udes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflectthe transactions and disposi
tions of the assets of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary topermit preparation o
f financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations ofmanagement and direc
tors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use, or
 disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.Management assessed the e
ffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control— Integrated
Framework
(2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on its assessment and those criteria,management has concluded 
that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independen

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Shareholders and the Board of Di
rectors ofPG&E Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of PG&E Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, theCompany’s related consolida
ted statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2018, and the related notes and 
the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financialstatements present f
airly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and itscash flows for each of the th
ree years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ofAmerica.
We have also audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committeeof Sponsoring Organizations of the Tr
eadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internalcontrol over financia
l reporting.Going Concern
The accompanying financi
al statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Notes 1 and 13 to thefinancial statem
ents, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp wildfire may result in material losses to the Company, which contributed to theCompany’s decision to voluntari
ly file for bankruptcy as discussed below. These circumstances r aise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a goingconcern. Management's plans 
in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result fromthe outcome of this uncer
tainty . Bankruptcy Proceedings
As discussed in Note 1 to the financi
al statements, on January 29, 2019, the Company has voluntarily filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.Bankruptcy Code. The accompanying fin
ancial statements do not purport to reflect or provide for the consequences of the bankruptcy proceedings. In particular,such financial state
ments do not purport to show (1) as to assets, their realizable value on a liquidation basis or their availability to satisfy liabilities; (2) as to pre-petition liabilit
ies, the settlement amounts for allowed claims, or the status and priority thereof; (3) as to shareholder accounts, the effect of any changes that maybe made in the capita
lization of the Company; or (4) as to operations, the effect of any changes that may be made in its business.Basis for Opinion
These financial stat
ements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statementsbased on our audits. We are a pub
lic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securit
ies laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater
ial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included exam
ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles u
sed and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.
