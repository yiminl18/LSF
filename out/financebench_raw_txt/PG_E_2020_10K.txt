PART IITEM 1. BUSINESS
PG&E Corporation, incorporated in Cal
ifornia in 1995, is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a publicutility operating in nor
thern and central California. The Utility was incorporated in California in 1905. PG&E Corporation became the holding company of theUtility and its subsidiari
es in 1997. The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers. PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s operating revenues, income, and total assets can be found below in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.The principal executiv
e offices of PG&E Corporation and the Utility are located at 77 Beale Street, P.O. Box 770000, San Francisco, California 94177. PG&ECorporation’s telephone numbe
r is (415) 973-1000 and the Utility’s telephone number is (415) 973-7000.This is a combined Annual Report on Form 10-K fo
r PG&E Corporation and the Utility. Each of PG&E Corporation and the Utility is a separate entity, withdistinct creditors and 
claimants, and is subject to separate laws, rules, and regulations.Over the past several yea
rs, Northern California has experienced major wildfires. For more information about material wildfires, see Item 7. MD&A, and Note 14of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements in Item 8.This 2020 Form 10-K contains forward-looking s
tatements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of the significant risksthat could affect th
e outcome of these forward-looking statements and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows, see I
tem 1A. Risk Factors and the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” above.Regulatory Environment 
The Utility’s business is subjec
t to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. At the state level, the Utility is regulatedprimarily by the CPUC. At the federa
l level, the Utility is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC and the NRC. The Utility is also subject to the requirements ofother federal, stat
e and local regulatory agencies, including with respect to safety, the environment, and health, such as the NTSB.This section and the “Environm
ental Regulation” and the “Ratemaking Mechanisms” sections below summarize some of the more significant laws, regulations,and regulatory proceedings 
affecting the Utility. (For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Regulatory Matters” under Item 7. MD&A.)PG&E Corporation is a “public util
ity holding company” as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and is subject to regulatory oversightby the FERC. PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries a
re exempt from all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 other than theobligation to provide acc
ess to their books and records to the FERC and the CPUC for ratemaking purposes.California Public Utilities Commiss
ionThe CPUC is a regulatory agency that r
egulates privately owned public utilities in California. The CPUC has jurisdiction over the rates and terms and conditions ofservice for the Utili
ty’s electric and natural gas distribution operations, electric generation, and natural gas transmission and storage services. The CPUC also hasexercised jurisdict
ion over the Utility’s issuances of securities, dispositions of utility assets and facilities, energy purchases on behalf of the Utility’s electric andnatural gas retail 
customers, rates of return, rates of depreciation, oversight of nuclear decommissioning, and aspects of the siting of facilities used in providingelectric and natur
al gas utility service.The CPUC enforces state laws and regula
tions that set forth safety requirements pertaining to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of utilitygas and electric fa
cilities.  The CPUC can impose penalties of up to $100,000 per day, per violation. The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount ofpenalties based on the tot
ality of the circumstances, including such factors as the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the numberof persons affected; and 
the good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The CPUC also is required toconsider the appropriat
eness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.14

The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issue citations and impose penalties for violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports. Underthe current gas and ele
ctric citation programs adopted by the CPUC in September 2016, the SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation; but ifit assesses a penalty for 
a violation, it has the authority to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $100,000, with an administrative limit of $8 million percitation issued. The SED may, at i
ts discretion, impose penalties on a daily basis, or on less than a daily basis, for violations that continued for more than one day.The SED has the discretion eithe
r to address each violation in a distinct citation or to include multiple violations in a single citation regardless of whether theviolations occurred in th
e same incident or are of a similar nature. Penalty payments for citations issued pursuant to the gas and electric safety citation programs arethe responsibility of shar
eholders of an issuer and may not be recovered in rates or otherwise directly or indirectly charged to customers.The California State Legis
lature also directs the CPUC to implement state laws and policies, such as the laws relating to wildfires and wildfire cost recovery,increasing renewable en
ergy resources, the development and widespread deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, the reduction of GHGemissions, the establishm
ent of energy storage procurement targets, and the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The CPUC isresponsible for approving funding 
and administration of state-mandated public purpose programs such as energy efficiency and other customer programs. TheCPUC also conducts audits and reviews of the Uti
lity’s accounting, performance, and compliance with regulatory guidelines.The CPUC has imposed various conditions that gove
rn the relationship between the Utility and PG&E Corporation and other affiliates, including financialconditions that require PG&E Corpor
ation’s Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary andprudent to meet the Util
ity’s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. (For more information on specific CPUC enforcementmatters and CPUC-implemented 
laws and policies and the related impact on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, and “Enforcement andLitigation Matters,” 
“Regulatory Matters,” “Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives” and “Liquidity and Financial Resources” in Item 7. MD&A and Note 15 of theNotes to the Consolidated Financia
l Statements in Item 8.)Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and California Independent System Operator
The FERC has jurisdiction over the Util
ity’s electric transmission revenue requirements and rates, the licensing of substantially all of the Utility’s hydroelectricgeneration facili
ties, and the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas. The FERC regulates the interconnections of the Utility’s transmission systems withother electric syst
ems and generation facilities, the tariffs and conditions of service of regional transmission organizations, and the terms and rates of wholesaleelectricity sal
es. The FERC also is charged with adopting and enforcing mandatory standards governing the reliability of the nation’s electric transmission grid,including standards to prote
ct the nation’s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. The FERC’s approval is alsorequired under Federal Power Act Se
ction 203 before undertaking certain transactions, including most mergers and consolidations, certain transactions that resultin a change in control of a u
tility, purchases of utility securities and dispositions of utility property. The FERC has authority to impose fines of up to $1 million perday for violations of cer
tain federal statutes and regulations. (For more information on specific FERC requirements and their impact on PG&E Corporation and theUtility, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, 
and “Regulatory Matters,” “Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives” and “Liquidity and Financial Resources” in Item 7. MD&Aand Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidat
ed Financial Statements in Item 8.)The CAISO is the FERC-approved regional transmiss
ion organization for the Utility’s service territory. The CAISO controls the operation of the electrictransmission system in Cali
fornia and provides open access transmission service on a non-discriminatory basis. The CAISO is also responsible for planningtransmission system addit
ions, ensuring the maintenance of adequate reserves of generating capacity, ensuring that the reliability of the transmission system ismaintained, and operat
ing an interstate Energy Imbalance Market.Nuclear Regulatory Commission
The NRC oversees the licensing, constru
ction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, including the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at DiabloCanyon and the Utility’s reti
red nuclear generating unit at Humboldt Bay. (See “Electricity Resources” below.) NRC regulations require extensive monitoring andreview of the safety, rad
iological, seismic, environmental, and security aspects of these facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority toimpose fines or to force 
a shutdown of a nuclear plant, or both. NRC safety and security requirements have, in the past, necessitated substantial capitalexpenditures at Diablo Canyon, and subst
antial capital expenditures could be required in the future. (For more information about Diablo Canyon, see Item 1A RiskFactors and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consol
idated Financial Statements in Item 8.)15

Other RegulatorsThe California Energy Commission 
is the state’s primary energy policy and planning agency. The CEC is responsible for licensing all thermal power plants over50 MW within California. The CEC also is r
esponsible for forecasts of future energy needs used by the CPUC in determining the adequacy of the utilities’electricity procurement plans an
d for adopting building and appliance energy efficiency requirements.The California Air Resources Board 
is the state agency responsible for setting and monitoring GHG and other emission limits. The CARB is also responsible foradopting and enforcing regul
ations to implement state law requirements to gradually reduce GHG emissions in California. (See “Environmental Regulation - AirQuality and Climate Change” be
low.)The National Transportation Sa
fety Board is an independent U.S. government investigative agency responsible for civil transportation accident investigations,including pipeline acc
idents. The NTSB also conducts special investigations and safety studies, and issues safety recommendations to prevent future accidents. Asa result of its investig
ation into the September 2010 San Bruno natural gas explosion, the NTSB issued 12 safety recommendations to the Utility, and alsosubsequently issued 28 safety re
commendations for the gas pipeline industry as a result of a safety study on integrity management of gas transmission pipelines inurban areas.
In addition, the Utility obt
ains permits, authorizations, and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of the Utility’s generation facilities,electricity transmission lines,
 natural gas transportation pipelines, and gas compressor station facilities. The Utility also periodically obtains permits,authorizations, and lic
enses in connection with distribution of electricity and natural gas that grant the Utility rights to occupy and/or use public property for theoperation of the Utility
’s business and to conduct certain related operations. The Utility has franchise agreements with approximately 300 cities and counties thatpermit the Utility to 
install, operate, and maintain the Utility’s electric and natural gas facilities in the public streets and highways. In exchange for the right to usepublic streets and highways, the Ut
ility pays annual fees to the cities and counties. In most cases, the Utility’s franchise agreements are for an indeterminate term,with no expiration date. (For mo
re information see Item 1A. Risk Factors.)Third-party Monitor
On April 12, 2017, the Utility retain
ed a third-party monitor (the “Monitor”) at the Utility’s expense as part of its compliance with the sentencing terms of theUtility’s January 27, 2017 feder
al criminal conviction, which sentenced the Utility to, among other things, a five-year corporate probation period and oversight bythe Monitor for a period of 
five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years.  The goal of the Monitor is to help ensure that the Utilitytakes reasonable and ap
propriate steps to maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations and maintains effective ethics, compliance, and safety relatedincentive programs on a Uti
lity-wide basis. (For more information see Item 1A. Risk Factors and “US District Court Matters and Probation” under “Enforcementand Litigation Matters
” in Item 7. MD&A.)Material Effects of Compliance wi
th Material Governmental RegulationsAs indicated above, the Utili
ty’s business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. Compliance with suchextensive government regu
lations requires substantial capital expenditures and has had in the past and may continue to have in the future a material effect onPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and competitive position. Generally, the Utility expects torecover the cost of comp
liance with government regulations from customers through its GRC proceedings, or other proceedings. To the extent the Utility incurscosts above authorized or in
curs additional types of costs not included in rates, the Utility would expect to apply for recovery of such costs. Such recovery wouldbe subject to the CPUC’s approval and could 
involve its reasonableness review.Costs incurred in 2020 included costs 
associated with upgrading and maintaining the Utility’s electric and natural gas infrastructure in accordance with CPUCrequirements and NTSB safety re
commendations, costs in connection with participating in the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054, costs in connection with execution ofwildfire mitigation 
efforts, the cost of complying with the licensing regulations of the FERC, and expenses under various other generation, distribution and storageregulations, the amount of whi
ch was substantial.If the Utility is unable 
to recover these costs, or incurs fines or penalties as a result of non-compliance with such laws and regulations, PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and competitive position could be materially impacted. (For more information, see Item 1A.Risk Factors and “Regulatory Matt
ers” in Item 7. MD&A.)16

Environmental RegulationThe Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety andhealth of the Utility’s p
ersonnel and the public. These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous andradioactive substances
; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting and reduction of CO and other GHG emissions; the transpor tation,handling, storage and disposal of sp
ent nuclear fuel; and the environmental impacts of land use, including endangered species and habitat protection. The penaltiesfor violation of these l
aws and requirements can be severe and may include significant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions. These laws and requirementsalso may require the Uti
lity, under certain circumstances, to interrupt or curtail operations. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.) Generally, the Utility recovers most of thecosts of complying with environm
ental laws and regulations in the Utility’s rates, subject to reasonableness review. Environmental costs associated with the clean-up of most sites that conta
in hazardous substances are subject to a ratemaking mechanism described in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.
Hazardous Waste Compliance and Remediation
The Utility’s facili
ties are subject to various regulations adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including the Resource Conservation andRecovery Act and the Comprehensive Env
ironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. The Utility is also subject to the regulationsadopted by other federal 
agencies responsible for implementing federal environmental laws. The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulationsadopted by the State of Califo
rnia and various state and local agencies. These federal and state laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous substanceon the (1) owner or operator of 
the site where the release occurred, (2) on companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances, and(3) in some cases, their 
corporate successors. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, these persons (known as“potentially responsibl
e parties”) may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, monitoring and paying for the harmcaused to natural resour
ces, and paying for the costs of health studies.The Utility has a comprehens
ive program in place to comply with these federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Under federal and California laws, the Utilitymay be responsible for re
mediation of hazardous substances even if it did not deposit those substances on the site. The Utility’s remediation activities are overseenby the California DTSC, several Cali
fornia regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies. The Utility has incurredsignificant environmen
tal remediation liabilities associated with former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, sites where natural gascompressor stations are 
located, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous substances. Groundwater at the Utility’sHinkley and Topock natural gas comp
ressor stations contains hexavalent chromium as a result of the Utility’s past operating practices. The Utility is responsiblefor remediating this g
roundwater contamination and for abating the effects of the contamination on the environment.For more information about 
environmental remediation liabilities, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Air Quality and Climate Change
The Utility’s electr
ic generation plants, natural gas pipeline operations, vehicle fleet, and fuel storage tanks are subject to numerous air pollution control laws,including the federal Cl
ean Air Act, as well as state and local statutes. These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, those contributing to theformation of ground-leve
l ozone, carbon dioxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO ), nitrogen oxides (NO ), particulate ma tter, and other emissions.Federal Regulation
At the federal level, 
the EPA is charged with implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air Act. Although there have been several legislative attempts toaddress climate chang
e through imposition of nationwide regulatory limits on GHG emissions, comprehensive federal legislation has not yet been enacted. In theabsence of federal l
egislative action, the EPA has used its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to address GHG emissions.22
2 x 17

Tackling the climate crisis is a key priority of the Biden Administration, and the Administration has signaled its intent to use its executive and regulatoryauthorities to reduce 
emissions in line with science-based targets. On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order directing the EPA to considersuspending, revising or rescinding 
the Trump Administration’s rule for methane emissions from new sources in the oil and gas sector and propose a companionregulation for existing sou
rces, including the transmission, processing and storage segments of the industry. For power plants, the EPA is expected to propose amore stringent GHG standard for ex
isting sources, following the D.C. Circuit’s decision to vacate and remand the Trump Administration’s Affordable CleanEnergy rule on January 19, 2021.
State Regulation
California’s AB 32, the Global War
ming Solutions Act of 2006, provides for the gradual reduction of state-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. TheCARB has approved various regulations to ach
ieve the 2020 target, including GHG emissions reporting and a state-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade programthat sets gradually dec
lining limits (or “caps”) on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted by major GHG emission sources within different sectors of theeconomy.
The cap-and-trade progr
am’s first compliance period, which began on January 1, 2013, applied to the electric generation and large industrial sectors. In thesubsequent compliance per
iod, which began on January 1, 2015, the scope of the regulation was expanded to include the natural gas and transportation sectors,effectively cover
ing all of the state economy’s major sectors through 2020. The Utility’s compliance obligation as a natural gas supplier applies to the GHGemissions attributable to t
he combustion of natural gas delivered to the Utility’s customers other than large natural gas delivery customers that are separatelyregulated as covered en
tities and have their own compliance obligation.In 2017, AB 398 extended the cap-and-tr
ade program through January 1, 2031. During each year of the program, the CARB issues emission allowances (i.e., therights to emit GHGs) equal to the 
amount of GHG emissions allowed for that year. Entities with a compliance obligation can obtain allowances from the CARB atquarterly auctions or f
rom third parties or exchanges. Complying entities may also satisfy a portion of their compliance obligation through the purchase of offsetcredits (e.g., credits 
for GHG reductions achieved by third parties, such as landowners, livestock owners, and farmers, that occur outside of the entities’ facilitiesthrough CARB-qualified offset proje
cts such as reforestation or biomass projects). The Utility expects all costs and revenues associated with the GHG cap-and-trade program to be passed 
through to customers.SB 32 (2016) requires that CARB ensure a 40% reduc
tion in GHGs by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The California RPS program that requires utilities togradually increase th
e amount of renewable energy delivered to their customers is also expected to help reduce GHG emissions in California. In September 2018,SB 100 was signed into law, which accelera
ted the state’s 50% RPS target to December 31, 2026, increased the RPS target to 60% by December 31, 2030, andfurther amended the RPS statut
e to set a policy of meeting 100% of retail sales from eligible renewables and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045.Additionally, Executive Order B-55
-18 set a statewide goal to achieve economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2045 and to maintain net negative emissions thereafter.The Utility will be an act
ive participant in regulatory proceedings to determine how the state will achieve carbon neutrality.Climate Change Resilience Strateg
iesDuring 2020, the Utility continued i
ts programs to mitigate the impact of the Utility’s operations (including customer energy usage) on the environment and to takeactions to increase its resilie
nce in light of the impacts of climate change on the Utility’s operations. The Utility regularly reviews the most relevant scientificliterature on cli
mate change such as rising sea levels, major storm events, increasing temperatures and heatwaves, wildfires, drought and land subsidence, to helpthe Utility identify and
 evaluate climate change-related risks and develop the necessary resilience strategies. The Utility maintains emergency response plans andprocedures to address a rang
e of near-term risks, including wildfires, extreme storms, and heat waves and uses its risk-assessment process to prioritizeinfrastructure inves
tments for longer-term risks associated with climate change. The Utility also engages with leaders from business, government, academia, andnon-profit organizations 
to share information and plan for the future.18

The Utility is working to better understand the current and future impacts of climate change. The Utility’s safety risks are included in its RAMP submittals with theCPUC. The Climate Resilience RAMP model indica
ted potential additional Utility safety consequences due to climate change, including in the near term. TheUtility is conducting foundat
ional work to help anticipate and plan for evolving conditions in terms of weather and climate-change related events. This work isguiding efforts to design a Uti
lity-wide climate change risk integration strategy. This strategy will inform resource planning and investment, operational decisions,and potential additiona
l programs to identify and pursue mitigations that will incorporate the resilience and safety of the Utility’s assets, infrastructure, operations,employees, and customers. The s
trategy will be informed by a multi-year, system-wide CVA to better understand how climate-driven natural hazards will impactthe Utility’s assets, serv
ices, and operations.With respect to electric operation
s, climate scientists project that climate change will lead to increased electricity demand due to more extreme and frequent hotweather. The Utility beli
eves its strategies to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficiency and demand response programs, infrastructure improvements, andthe use of renewable energy 
and energy storage are strategies that will help it adapt to the expected changes in demand for electricity. The Utility is makingsubstantial investments t
o build a more resilient system that can better withstand extreme weather and related emergencies. Over the long term, the Utility alsofaces the risk of higher 
flooding and inundation potential at coastal and low elevation facilities due to projected sea level rise combined with high tides, stormrunoff and storm surges. Inland 
areas, such as near the Sacramento Delta, will also be vulnerable to flooding amid changes to precipitation patterns and extremestorms.
 As the state continues to face increased risk of wildfires, the Utility’s activities, including vegetation management, will continue to play an important roleto help reduce the risk
 of wildfire and its impact on electric and gas facilities.Climate scientists predict that
 climate change will result in rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns in the Utility’s service territory, includingdecreasing snowpack. This could, in tu
rn, affect the Utility’s hydroelectric generation. This issue is being analyzed as part of the Utility’s CVA. To plan for thischange, the Utility is engag
ing with state and local stakeholders and is also adopting strategies such as maintaining higher winter carryover reservoir storage levels,reducing discretionary 
reservoir water releases, and collaborating on research and new modeling tools.With respect to natur
al gas operations, both safety-related pipeline strength testing and normal pipeline maintenance and operations release the GHG methane intothe atmosphere. The Utili
ty has taken steps to reduce the release of methane by implementing techniques including drafting and cross-compression, which reducethe pressure and volume of na
tural gas within pipelines prior to venting.  In addition, the Utility continues to achieve reductions in methane emissions byimplementing improvements in
 leak detection and repair, upgrades at metering and regulating stations, and maintenance and replacement of other pipelinematerials.
Emissions Data
PG&E Corporation and the Utility tr
ack and report their annual environmental performance results across a broad spectrum of areas. The Utility reports its GHGemissions to the CARB and the EPA on a mandatory basis. On a vo
luntary basis, the Utility reports a more comprehensive emissions inventory to The ClimateRegistry, a non-profit organi
zation. The Utility’s third-party verified voluntary GHG inventory reported to The Climate Registry for 2019, which is the most recentdata available, tot
aled about 46 million metric tonnes of CO equivalent, the major ity of which came from customer natural gas use. The following table shows the2019 GHG emissions data the Utility repo
rted to the CARB under AB 32, which is the most recent data available. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also publishadditional GHG emissions data in th
eir annual Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report.Source

The Utility utilized the CEC’s Power Source Disclosure program methodology to calculate the CO emissions rate associated  with the electricity delivered to retailcustomers in 2019. As required by AB 1110, the CEC modifi
ed the Power Source Disclosure program methodology in 2020 for the 2019 reporting year. Thismodified methodology diff
ered from prior reporting years and resulted in a third-party verified CO emissions rate for 2019 tha t was virtually GHG emissions free.Air Emissions Data for Utility-Owned Generation

In 2014, the E
PA issued final regulations to implement the requirements of the federal Clean Water Act that require cooling water intake structures at electricpower plants, suc
h as the nuclear generation facilities at Diablo Canyon, to reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts.Various industry and environment
al groups challenged the federal regulations and they were upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.California’s once-through 
cooling policy adopted by the California Water Board in 2010 is considered to be at least as stringent as the new federal regulations andtherefore governs implementatio
n in California.The California Water Boar
d’s policy generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other significant measures to reduce the impact on marine life fromexisting power generati
on facilities in California by at least 85%. The policy also provided for an alternative compliance approach for nuclear plants if certaincriteria were me
t. As required by the policy, the California Water Board appointed a committee to evaluate the feasibility and cost of using alternative technologiesto achieve complianc
e at Diablo Canyon. The committee’s consultant submitted its final report to the California Water Board in September 2014. The reportaddressed feasibility, 
costs and timeframes to install alternative technologies at Diablo Canyon, such as cooling towers.On June 20, 2016, the Utility entered in
to a joint proposal with certain parties to retire Diablo Canyon’s two nuclear power reactor units at the expiration of theircurrent operating li
censes in 2024 and 2025. The CPUC approved the retirement in January 2018. As a result of the planned retirement, the California Water Boardwill no longer need to address a
lternative compliance measures for Diablo Canyon. As required under the policy, the Utility will continue to pay an annual interimmitigation fee unti
l operations cease in 2025.Additionally, in December 2020, th
e Utility reached a settlement with the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board and the California AttorneyGeneral’s Office rega
rding the thermal component of the plant’s once-through cooling discharge. Under the settlement, which will take the form of a ConsentJudgement filed in San Luis Obispo County Superio
r Court, the Utility will make a payment of $5.9 million, funding local water quality projects selected by theCentral Coast Board.
Nuclear Fuel Disposal
Under the Nuclear Waste Poli
cy Act of 1982, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and electric utilities with commercial nuclear power plants were authorized toenter into contracts und
er which the DOE would be required to dispose of the utilities’ spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by January 1998, inexchange for fees paid by th
e utilities’ customers. The DOE has been unable to meet its contractual obligation with the Utility to dispose of nuclear waste from theUtility’s two nuclear gene
rating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired nuclear facility at Humboldt Bay. As a result, the Utility constructed interim dry caskstorage faciliti
es to store its spent fuel onsite at Diablo Canyon and at Humboldt Bay until the DOE fulfills its contractual obligation to take possession of the spentfuel. The Utility and other nu
clear power plant owners sued the DOE to recover the costs that they incurred to construct interim storage facilities for spent nuclearfuel.

In September 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Utility executed a settlement agreement that provided a claims process by which the Utility submitsannual requests for rei
mbursement of its ongoing spent fuel storage costs.  The claim for the period June 1, 2019 through May 31, 2020, totaled approximately $8.5million and is current
ly under review by the DOE.  Amounts reimbursed by DOE are refunded to customers through rates. Considerable uncertainty continues toexist regarding when and whether 
the DOE will meet its contractual obligation to the Utility and other nuclear power plant owners to dispose of spent fuel.Ratemaking Mechanisms
The Utility’s rates for 
electric and natural gas utility services are set at levels that are intended to allow the Utility to recover its costs of providing service and areturn on invested capit
al (“cost-of-service ratemaking”). Before setting rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct proceedings to determine the amount that theUtility will be authorize
d to collect from its customers (“revenue requirements”). The Utility’s revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set toenable the Utility to r
ecover its reasonable operating expenses (e.g., maintenance, administration and general expenses) and capital costs (e.g., depreciation, andfinancing expenses). In addi
tion, the CPUC authorizes the Utility to collect revenues to recover costs that the Utility is allowed to “pass-through” to customers(referred to as “Uti
lity Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Item 7. MD&A), including its costs to procure electricity, natural gas and nuclear fuel,to administer public purpos
e and customer programs, and to decommission its nuclear facilities.The Utility’s rate of r
eturn on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceedings. The rate of return on all other Utility assets is set in theCPUC’s cost of capital proceeding. Othe
r than certain gas transmission and storage revenues, the Utility’s base revenues are “decoupled” from its sales volumethrough certain regula
tory balancing accounts, or revenue adjustment mechanisms, that are designed to allow the Utility to fully collect its authorized base revenuerequirements. As a result, 
the Utility’s base revenues are not impacted by fluctuations in sales resulting from, for example, weather or economic conditions. TheUtility’s earnings prim
arily depend on its ability to manage its base operating and capital costs (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings”in Item 7. MD&A) within its author
ized base revenue requirements.Due to the seasonal nature of 
the Utility’s business and rate design, customer electric bills are generally higher during summer months (May to October) because ofhigher demand, driven by air 
conditioning loads.  Customer bills related to gas service generally increase during the winter months (November to March) toaccount for the gas peak due 
to heating.From time to time, the CPUC may use in
centive ratemaking mechanisms that provide the Utility an opportunity to earn some additional revenues. For example, theUtility has earned incen
tives for the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs.See “Regulatory Matters” 
in Item 7. MD&A for more information on specific CPUC proceedings.Base Revenues
General Rate Cases
The GRC is the primary proceeding in whi
ch the CPUC determines the amount of base revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect fromcustomers to recover th
e Utility’s anticipated costs, including return on rate base, related to its electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and Utility-ownedelectric genera
tion operations. The CPUC generally conducts a GRC every three or four years. Starting with the 2023 GRC, the CPUC will conduct a GRC every 4years. The CPUC approves the annual revenue 
requirements for the first year (or “test year”) of the GRC period and typically authorizes the Utility to receiveannual increases in rev
enue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRC period (known as “attrition years”). Attrition year rate adjustments are generallyprovided for cost increas
es related to increases in invested capital and inflation. Parties in the Utility’s GRC include the PAO and TURN, which generally representthe overall interes
ts of residential customers, as well as numerous intervenors that represent other business, community, customer, environmental, and unioninterests.
On January 16, 2020, the CPUC approved a final decision 
in its OIR to Develop a Risk-Based Decision-Making Framework to Evaluate Safety and ReliabilityImprovements and Revise the GRC Plan, as a 
result of which the Utility will combine its GRC and GT&S rate cases starting with the 2023 GRC. (For moreinformation about the Uti
lity’s GRC, see “Regulatory Matters - 2017 General Rate Case” and “Regulatory Matters - 2020 General Rate Case” in Item 7. MD&A.)21

Natural Gas Transmission and Storage Rate CasesThe CPUC determines the Utility’s au
thorized revenue requirements and rates for its natural gas transmission and storage services in the GT&S rate case.  TheCPUC generally has conducted a GT&S rate c
ase every three or four years.  Similar to the GRC, the CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the firstyear (or “test year”) of the 
GT&S rate case period and typically determines annual increases in revenue requirements for attrition years of the GT&S rate caseperiod.  Parties in the Util
ity’s GT&S rate case include the PAO and TURN.As previously mentioned, on January 16, 2020, th
e CPUC approved a final decision that requires the Utility to combine its GRC and GT&S rate cases starting withthe 2023 GRC. (For more information, see 
“Regulatory Matters - 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case” and “Regulatory Matters - 2019 GasTransmission and Storage Rate Case
” in Item 7. MD&A.)  Cost of Capital Proceedings
The CPUC periodically conducts a cost of 
capital proceeding to authorize the Utility’s capital structure and rates of return for its electric generation, electric andnatural gas distribution, 
and natural gas transmission and storage rate base. On December 19, 2019, the CPUC issued a final decision that authorizes the Utility’scapital structure 
through 2022, consisting of 52% common equity, 47.5% long-term debt, and 0.5% preferred stock. The CPUC also set the authorized ROEthrough 2023 at 10.25% and reset the 
cost of debt to 5.16%. The CPUC also authorized the continuation of an adjustment mechanism to allow the Utility’s cost ofdebt and ROE to be adjusted if the ut
ility bond index changes by certain thresholds, which are reviewed annually. On August 20, 2020, the CPUC updated theUtility’s authorized cos
t of long-term debt from 5.16% to 4.17% as a result of the Chapter 11 exit financing.Electricity Transmission Owner Rate Cases
The FERC determines the amount of au
thorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect inrates in the TO rate cas
e. On December 30, 2020, the FERC approved a final settlement of the Utility’s formula rate. The FERC-approved formula rate will beeffective through Dece
mber 31, 2023. These FERC-approved rates are included by the CPUC in the Utility’s retail electric rates and by the CAISO in itsTransmission Access Charges to wholesa
le customers. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - Transmission Owner Rate Cases” in Item 7. MD&A.) TheUtility also recovers a po
rtion of its revenue requirements for its wholesale electric transmission costs through charges collected under specific contracts withwholesale transmission custo
mers that the Utility entered into before the CAISO began its operations. These wholesale customers are charged individualized ratesbased on the terms of thei
r contracts.Memorandum Account Costs
Periodically, costs aris
e that could not have been anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests or that have been deliberately excluded therefrom.These costs may result fro
m catastrophic events, changes in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to trackincremental costs in 
a memorandum account and the CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incrementaland prudently incurred. These 
accounts allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work related to disaster and wildfire response, and other wildfireprevention-related 
costs. While the Utility expects such costs to be recoverable, rate recovery requires CPUC authorization in separate proceedings or through aGRC for which the Utility may be unable 
to predict the outcome. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - Application for Recovery of Costs Recorded inthe Wildfire Expense Me
morandum Account,” “Regulatory Matters - Catastrophic Event Memorandum Accounts and Applications,” and “Regulatory Matters -Wildfire Mitigat
ion Memorandum and Balancing Accounts” in Item 7. MD&A.)Revenues to Recover Energy Procurement and Other Pass-Through Costs
Electricity Procurement Costs
California IOUs are re
sponsible for procuring electrical capacity required to meet bundled customer demand, plus applicable reserve margins, that are not satisfiedfrom their own generation 
facilities and existing electric contracts. The utilities are responsible for scheduling and bidding electric generation resources, includingcertain electricity procured from thir
d parties into the wholesale market, to meet customer demand according to which resources are the least expensive (i.e., usingthe principles of “le
ast-cost dispatch”). In addition, the utilities are required to obtain CPUC approval of their BPPs based on long-term demand forecasts. InOctober 2015, the CPUC approved the Utility’s mos
t recent comprehensive BPP. It was revised since its initial approval and will remain in effect as revised untilsuperseded by a subsequent CPUC-approved plan.
22

California law allows electric utilities to recover the costs incurred in compliance with their CPUC-approved BPPs without further after-the-fact reasonablenessreview by the CPUC. The CPUC may disallow costs associated with 
electricity purchases if the costs were not incurred in compliance with the CPUC-approvedplan or if the CPUC determines tha
t the utility failed to follow the principles of least-cost dispatch. Additionally, the CPUC may disallow the cost of replacementpower procured due to unplanned outag
es at utility-owned generation facilities.The Utility recovers its 
electric procurement costs annually primarily through balancing accounts. (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.) E
ach year, the CPUC reviews the Utility’s forecasted procurement costs related to power purchase agreements, derivative instruments, GHGemissions costs, and generat
ion fuel expense, and approves a forecasted revenue requirement. The CPUC may adjust the Utility’s retail electric rates morefrequently if the forecasted a
ggregate over-collections or under-collections in the energy resource recovery account exceed five percent of its prior year electricprocurement and Utility
-owned generation revenues. The CPUC performs an annual compliance review of the transactions recorded in the ERRA.The CPUC has approved various power purchase agre
ements that the Utility has entered into with third parties in accordance with the Utility’s CPUC-approvedBPP, to meet mandatory renewable 
energy targets, and to comply with resource adequacy requirements. (For more information, see “Electric Utility Operations -Electricity Resources
” below as well as Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)Natural Gas Procurement, Storage, and Transportation Costs
The Utility recovers the
 cost of gas used in generation facilities as a cost of electricity that is recovered annually through retail electric rates.The Utility sets the 
natural gas procurement rate for small commercial and residential customers (referred to as “core” customers) monthly, based on the forecastedcosts of natural gas, core p
ipeline capacity and storage costs. The Utility recovers the cost of gas purchased on behalf of core customers as well as the cost ofderivative instrumen
ts for its core gas portfolio, through its retail gas rates, subject to limits as set forth in its CPIM described below. The Utility reflects thedifference between a
ctual natural gas purchase costs and forecasted natural gas purchase costs in several natural gas balancing accounts, with under-collections andover-collections tak
en into account in subsequent monthly rate changes.The CPIM protects the Utility ag
ainst after-the-fact reasonableness reviews of its gas procurement costs for its core gas portfolio. Under the CPIM, the Utility’snatural gas purchase costs 
for a fixed 12-month period are compared to an aggregate market-based benchmark based on a weighted average of published monthlyand daily natural gas pri
ce indices at the points where the Utility typically purchases natural gas. Costs that fall within a tolerance band, which is 99% to 102% ofthe commodity benchmark, 
are considered reasonable and are fully recovered in customers’ rates. One-half of the costs above 102% of the benchmark arerecoverable in custom
ers’ rates, and the Utility’s customers receive in their rates 80% of any savings resulting from the Utility’s cost of natural gas that is less than99% of the benchmark. The Util
ity retains the remaining amount of these savings as incentive revenues, subject to a cap equal to 1.5% of total natural gascommodity costs. While th
is mechanism remains in place, changes in the price of natural gas, consistent with the market-based benchmark, are not expected tomaterially impact net income.
The Utility incurs transpor
tation costs under various agreements with interstate and Canadian third-party transportation service providers. These providers transportnatural gas from the poin
ts at which the Utility takes delivery of natural gas (typically in Canada, the U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern United States)to the points at which the Util
ity’s natural gas transportation system begins.  These agreements are governed by the FERC-approved tariffs that detail rates, rules,and terms of service fo
r the provision of natural gas transportation services to the Utility on interstate and Canadian pipelines. The FERC approves the UnitedStates tariffs that sh
ippers, including the Utility, pay for pipeline service, and the applicable Canadian tariffs are approved by the National Energy Board, aCanadian regulatory agency. Th
e transportation costs the Utility incurs under these agreements are recovered through CPUC-approved rates as core natural gasprocurement costs or as a 
cost of electricity.23

Costs Associated with Public Purpose and Customer ProgramsThe CPUC authorizes the Utility to re
cover the costs of various public purpose and other customer programs through the collection of rates from most Utilitycustomers.  These programs r
elate to energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, energy research and development, and other matters. Additionally, the CPUC has authorized the Ut
ility to provide discounted rates for specified types of customers, such as for low-income customers under theCalifornia Alternate Ra
tes for Energy (“CARE”) program, which is paid for by the Utility’s other customers.Nuclear Decommissioning Costs
The Utility’s nuclear power 
facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and the retired facility at Humboldt Bay. Nuclear decommissioning requires the saferemoval of nuclear facilities from 
service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of theproperty for unrestric
ted use. Nuclear decommissioning costs are generally collected in advance through rates and are held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to beused for the eventual deco
mmissioning of each nuclear unit. The Utility files an application with the CPUC every three years requesting approval of the Utility’supdated estimated deco
mmissioning costs and any rate change necessary to fully fund the nuclear decommissioning trusts to the levels needed to decommission theUtility’s nuclear plants.
For costs related to Asset Reti
rement Obligations see “Nuclear Decommissioning Obligation” in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements inItem 8.
Human Capital
Employees
At December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity had approximately 24,000 regular employees, 8 of whom were employees of PG&E Corporation. Of theUtility’s regular emp
loyees, approximately 15,000 are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the local chapters of three labor unions: the InternationalBrotherhood of Electrica
l Workers (“IBEW”) Local 1245; the Engineers and Scientists of California (“ESC”) IFPTE 20; and the Service Employees InternationalUnion Local 24/7 (“SEIU”). The colle
ctive bargaining agreements currently in effect for the IBEW Local 1245 and ESC Local 20 will expire on December 31,2025. The agreements incre
ase wages annually by 3.75% from 2022 through 2025 and maintain current contributions to specified benefits. The IBEW and ESCrepresent approximat
ely 63% of the Utility’s employee workforce and support several areas of the Utility’s business, including gas and electric operations. Theterm of the SEIU bargaining ag
reement ends on December 31, 2021. The Utility intends to initiate general negotiations of the SEIU bargaining agreement insummer of 2021.
PG&E Corporation, on average has approxi
mately 10 employees, all at the executive management level, which experienced significant employee turnoverthroughout the course of its Chapt
er 11 Cases in 2019 and 2020. The Utility generally has a stable workforce, which translated into low voluntary turnover duringthat period. Approximately 42
% of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s employees have a tenure of more than 10 years, resulting in an average tenure of 12years. Currently, approxima
tely 23% of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s employees are eligible to retire. (PG&E Corporation and the Utility defineretirement age as 55 y
ears and older.)Human Capital Management
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s hu
man capital resource objectives are to build and retain an engaged, well trained and diverse workforce. PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s Boards of Directors are responsible for overseeing management’s development and execution of PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s human capita
l strategy. Among other things, the Utility provides career opportunities through its Power Pathway™ workforce development program.Launched in 2008, PowerPathway is a workforce dev
elopment model to enlarge the talent pool of local, qualified, diverse candidates for skilled craft and utilityindustry jobs through training prog
ram partnerships with educational, community-based and government organizations. PowerPathway helps people throughout theUtility service ter
ritory, including women and military veterans, prepare and compete for high demand jobs in the utility and energy industry. Students receiveapproximately eight week
s of industry-informed curriculum to ensure the academic, job specific, employability skills and physical training necessary to effectivelycompete for entry-l
evel employment. Programs may also include hands-on training and on-the-job training.24

To build employee engagement, the Utility has a variety of both executive-level and employee-led initiatives and programs. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sexecutive teams meet regularly to
 discuss and evaluate the state of employee talent, determine which programs are driving engagement and performance, andclarify the specif
ic skills, behaviors and values that should be cultivated. Each year, the Utility honors employees whose work embodies safety, diversity andinclusion, environmental 
leadership, and community service. The Utility conducts a biennial employee engagement survey, quarterly pulse surveys and voluntaryupward feedback surveys to measu
re and track employee engagement progress.Every year, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity offer or require technical, leadership and employee training. For example, PG&E Corporation and the Utilityprovide employees a range o
f technical training on the knowledge and skills required to perform their jobs safely using approved tools and work procedures. Inaddition, employees are 
required to complete an annual compliance and ethics training and a Code of Conduct training, both of which are intended to promote aculture in which employees 
are encouraged to speak up with any concerns or ideas for continuous improvement. In addition, the Utility offers a variety of othertrainings and education oppor
tunities.PG&E Corporation and the Utility also p
rovide integrated solutions and programs that cover employee health and wellness and that encompass physical, emotionaland financial health, 
including an on-site health clinic, an annual health screening, and health management tools and resources, in addition to more traditionalprograms.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial incentives offered to employees include a Short-Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”), an at-risk part of employeecompensation, designed to rewa
rd eligible employees for achieving specific goals. The 2020 STIP was focused on company objectives of safety, customer impact,and financial health.
Any PG&E Corporation or Utility office
r compensation currently is funded by shareholders.Safety
The Utility has developed a f
ive-year workforce safety strategy that includes two major pillars: systems and culture. Systems refers to risk management,equipment, processes and proc
edures. Culture refers to employee engagement, adherence to established requirements, a sense of urgency for safety, and leadership.Focus areas in the 
Utility’s workplace safety strategy include: an enterprise safety management system, enhanced risk management, contractor management,improvement of safety 
technical standards, musculoskeletal disorder programs and ergonomics, safety audits, data management, systems and reporting, and safetyculture. The Utility uses a v
ariety of metrics to track workforce safety performance, including the number of injuries that result in days away, restricted ortransferred duty per 200,000 hours work
ed (“DART”). In 2020, the Utility’s DART was 1.34, which was 35% lower than in 2019 and its lowest rate in the past fiveyears.
In addition to employee sa
fety, a key area of the Utility’s workforce safety strategy includes strengthening contractor safety. The Utility’s Contractor SafetyProgram requires contra
ctors performing medium- and high-risk work to meet prequalification requirements to perform work for or on behalf of the Utility. TheUtility’s contractors 
and subcontractors include approximately 26,000 individuals from approximately 2,200 contractor companies. For employees and contractorsperforming medium- and h
igh-risk work, the Utility’s safety metrics include the number of workforce serious injuries and fatalities (“SIF-A”) and events that couldhave resulted in a SIF-A per 200,000 hours worked 
(the “SIF-P rate”). In 2020, the Utility had 10 SIF-A events, which resulted in five fatalities and seven injuries,and a SIF-P rate of 0.10, which was 29% lower than 
in 2019. The Utility began including contractors in its SIF-P rate in June 2020.Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility have continued to monitor activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionand the World Health Organiz
ation, and have updated the Utility’s protocols and actions in accordance with guidance from these organizations and withconsultation from the Uti
lity’s medical director. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also remained focused on protecting the health and safety of theiremployees, contractors 
and the Utility’s customers, while continuing to perform critical utility work, and have continued to monitor and track the impact of thepandemic, modifying or adopt
ing new policies in support of their employees’ health and safety as pandemic conditions and governmental response have changed.For example, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity have directed employees to work remotely from home where possible, implemented new face coverings andphysical distancing polic
ies, required virtual ergonomic evaluations to ensure that employees now working from home so do safely and ergonomically, providedadditional COVID-19 safety resourc
es for employees who perform utility work in the field, and updated several of their employee benefits as a result of COVID-19, including healthcare b
enefits, and interim time off and leave policies that support the care and new educational environment of children during the pandemic.25

Diversity and InclusionPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s go
al is to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture and workforce. These efforts are led by the Utility’s ChiefDiversity Officer, with support 
from the senior leadership team. The Compliance and Public Policy Committee of PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors reviewsthe companies’ diversi
ty and inclusion practices and performance. Key elements of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s approach include engaging employees,targeted employee dev
elopment to level the playing field for diverse talent, an ongoing commitment to diversity among our leadership team, and furthering culturalunderstanding and role-mode
ling inclusion. In 2020, women, minorities and military veterans accounted for approximately 27%, 46% and 7%, respectively, oftotal PG&E Corporation and Utility 
employees.In addition, the Utility’s 11 E
mployee Resource Groups and three Engineering Network Groups promote its business objectives and support a culture of diversityand inclusion by fostering emp
loyee belonging, supporting an environment of inclusion that values and respects diversity in the workforce, and promoting positiverelationships with the com
munities and customers the Utility serves.Electric Utility Opera
tionsThe Utility generates electricity
 and provides electric transmission and distribution services throughout its service territory in northern and central California toresidential, comme
rcial, industrial, and agricultural customers. The Utility provides “bundled” services (i.e., electricity, transmission and distribution services) tocustomers in its servic
e territory. Customers also can obtain electricity from alternative providers such as municipalities or CCAs, as well as from self-generationresources, such as rooftop sola
r installations. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.)Electricity Resources
The Utility is required
 to maintain capacity adequate to meet its customers’ demand for electricity (“load”), including peak demand and planning and operatingreserves, deliverabl
e to the locations and at times as may be necessary to provide reliable electric service. The Utility is responsible for scheduling and biddingelectric generation resources, i
ncluding certain electricity procured from third parties into the wholesale market, to meet customer demand according to whichresources are the le
ast expensive.The following table 
shows the percentage of the Utility’s estimated total net deliveries of electricity to customers in 2020 represented by each major electricresource, and further dis
cussed below. The Utility’s deliveries were primarily from renewable energy resources that qualify under California’s RPS and otherGHG-free resources (i.e., nucl
ear; and large hydroelectric generation). California’s RPS requirements and SB 100 goal to serve 100% of retail electricity sales withGHG-free resources by 2045 are discuss
ed further below and in the Environmental Regulation section.26

Amount is mainly comprised of net CAISO open market (sales)/purchases.
Renewable Energy Resources
California law establish
ed an RPS that requires load-serving entities, such as the Utility, to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy they deliver to theircustomers. In October 2015, the Cal
ifornia Governor signed SB 350, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015 into law. SB 350 became effectiveJanuary 1, 2016, and increases the 
amount of renewable energy that must be delivered by most load-serving entities, including the Utility, to their customers from33% of their total annua
l retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020 compliance period, to 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2028- 2030compliance period, and in 
each three-year compliance period thereafter, unless changed by legislative action. SB 350 provides compliance flexibility and waivermechanisms, including inc
reased flexibility to apply excess renewable energy procurement in one compliance period to future compliance periods. In September2018, the California Governor signed SB 100 into 
law, increasing from 50% to 60% of California’s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030;and established state pol
icy that 100% of all retail electricity sales must come from RPS-eligible or carbon-free resources by 2045. The Utility may in the futureincur additional costs to p
rocure renewable energy to meet the new renewable energy targets, which the Utility expects will continue to be recoverable fromcustomers as “pass-through” 
costs. The Utility also may be subject to penalties for failure to meet the higher targets. The CPUC is required to open a newrulemaking proceeding to 
adopt regulations to implement the higher renewable targets.Renewable generation resour
ces, for purposes of the RPS requirements, include bioenergy such as biogas and biomass, certain hydroelectric facilities (30 MW orless), wind, solar, and geotherm
al energy. RPS requirements are based on procurement, which aligns with the methodology presented in the first column of thetable above. Procurement 
from renewable energy sources was estimated as 35.6% in 2020. In accordance with the Power Content Label methodology presented inthe table above, an esti
mated 35.6% of the Utility’s energy deliveries was from renewable energy sources. (1)(2)

Energy Storage
As required by California law, th
e CPUC established a multi-year energy storage procurement framework, including energy storage procurement targets to beachieved by each load-se
rving entity under the CPUC jurisdiction, including the Utility. Under the adopted energy storage procurement framework, the Utility isrequired to procure 580 MW of qu
alifying storage capacity by the end of 2021, with all energy storage projects required to be operational by the end of 2024.The CPUC also adopted biennial interi
m storage targets for the Utility, beginning in 2014 and ending in 2020. Under the adopted framework, the Utility is requiredto submit biennial energy s
torage procurement plans to describe its strategy to meet its interim and total energy storage targets. As of December 31, 2020, theUtility had met its stor
age targets.Owned Generation Facilities

Generation Resources from Third PartiesThe Utility has entered in
to various agreements to purchase power and electric capacity, including agreements for renewable energy resources, in accordance withits CPUC-approved procurement plan. (Se
e “Ratemaking Mechanisms” above.) For more information regarding the Utility’s power purchase agreements, see Note15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements in Item 8.Electricity Transmission
At December 31, 2020, the Utility owned app
roximately 18,000 circuit miles of interconnected transmission lines operating at voltages ranging from 60 kV to 500kV. The Utility also operated 35 e
lectric transmission substations with a capacity of approximately 66,000 MVA. The Utility’s electric transmission system isinterconnected with el
ectric power systems in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, which includes many western states, the Canadian provinces ofAlberta and British Columbia, and p
arts of Mexico.Decisions about expansions and main
tenance of the transmission system can be influenced by decisions of the Utility’s regulators and the CAISO.Electricity Distribution
The Utility’s electr
ic distribution network consists of approximately 108,000 circuit miles of distribution lines (of which, as of December 31, 2020, approximately25% are underground and approxim
ately 75% are overhead), 68 transmission switching substations, and 758 distribution substations, with a capacity ofapproximately 32,000 MVA. The Utility’s d
istribution network interconnects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distribution substations,where equipment reduces th
e high-voltage transmission voltages to lower voltages, ranging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the Utility’scustomers.
These distribution substations s
erve as the central hubs for the Utility’s electric distribution network. Emanating from each substation are primary and secondarydistribution lines connec
ted to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users. In some cases, the Utilitysells electricity from its distrib
ution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity. The Utility operates electric distributioncontrol center fac
ilities in Concord, Rocklin, and Fresno, California; these control centers form a key part of the Utility’s efforts to create a smarter, more resilientgrid.

Natural Gas Utility Operations 
The Utility provides
 natural gas transportation services to “core” customers (i.e., small commercial and residential customers) and to “non-core” customers (i.e.,industrial, large commercial, an
d natural gas-fired electric generation facilities) that are connected to the Utility’s gas system in its service territory.  Corecustomers can purchase na
tural gas procurement service (i.e.,  natural gas supply) from either the Utility or non-utility third-party gas procurement serviceproviders (referred 
to as “core transport agents”).  When core customers purchase gas supply from a core transport agent, the Utility continues to provide gasdelivery, metering and b
illing services to customers.  When the Utility provides both transportation and procurement services, the Utility refers to the combinedservice as “bundled” natu
ral gas service.  Currently, more than 96% of core customers, representing approximately 84% of the annual core market demand, receivebundled natural gas servic
e from the Utility.The Utility generally does no
t provide procurement service to non-core customers, which must purchase their gas supplies from third-party suppliers, unless thecustomer is a natural g
as-fired generation facility with which the Utility has a power purchase agreement that includes its generation fuel expense. The Utilityoffers backbone gas transm
ission, gas delivery (local transmission and distribution), and gas storage services as separate and distinct services to its non-corecustomers.  Access to the Util
ity’s backbone gas transmission system is available for all natural gas marketers and shippers, as well as non-core customers.  TheUtility also delivers gas 
to off-system customers (i.e., outside of the Utility’s service territory) and to third-party natural gas storage customers.(1)  (2)

Natural Gas SuppliesThe Utility can receiv
e natural gas from all the major natural gas basins in western North America, including basins in western Canada, the Rocky Mountains, andthe southwestern United States. The Ut
ility can also receive natural gas from fields in California. The Utility purchases natural gas to serve its core customersdirectly from produce
rs and marketers in both Canada and the United States. The contract lengths and natural gas sources of the Utility’s portfolio of natural gaspurchase contracts have v
aried generally based on market conditions. During 2020, the Utility purchased approximately 282,000 MMcf of natural gas (net of thesale of excess supply of gas). Substan
tially all of this natural gas was purchased under contracts with a term of one year or less. The Utility’s largest individualsupplier represented app
roximately 17% of the total natural gas volume the Utility purchased during 2020.Natural Gas System Assets
The Utility owns and operates an in
tegrated natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution system that includes most of northern and central California. AtDecember 31, 2020, the Utility’s n
atural gas system consisted of approximately 43,500 miles of distribution pipelines, over 6,300 miles of backbone and localtransmission pipelines, and v
arious storage facilities. The Utility owns and operates eight natural gas compressor stations on its backbone transmission system andone small station on its lo
cal transmission system that are used to move gas through the Utility’s pipelines. The Utility’s backbone transmission system, composedprimarily of Lines 300, 400, and 401, is us
ed to transport gas from the Utility’s interconnection with interstate pipelines, other local distribution companies, andCalifornia gas fields to 
the Utility’s local transmission and distribution systems.The Utility has firm tr
ansportation agreements for delivery of natural gas from western Canada to the United States-Canada border with TransCanada NOVA GasTransmission, Ltd. interconne
cting downstream with TransCanada Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., B.C. System. The Foothills system interconnects at the border to thepipeline system owned by Gas Transmiss
ion Northwest, LLC, which provides natural gas transportation services to a point of interconnection with the Utility’snatural gas transporta
tion system on the Oregon-California border near Malin, Oregon. The Utility also has firm transportation agreements with Ruby Pipeline,LLC to transport natural gas f
rom the U.S. Rocky Mountains to the interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of Malin,Oregon, at the California bord
er. Similarly, the Utility has a firm transportation agreement with Transwestern Pipeline Company, LLC to transport natural gas fromsupply points in the southwestern United St
ates to interconnection points with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of California near Topock,Arizona. (For more informa
tion regarding the Utility’s natural gas transportation agreements, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements inItem 8.)
The Utility owns and operates thr
ee underground natural gas storage fields and has a 25% interest in a fourth storage field, all of which are connected to theUtility’s transmission syst
em.  The Utility owns and operates compressors and other facilities at these storage fields that are used to inject gas into the fields forstorage and later withdr
awal.  In addition, four independent storage operators are interconnected to the Utility’s northern California transmission system. In 2019,the CPUC approved the discontinuation (th
rough closure or sale) of operations at two gas storage fields.In 2020, the Utility continued upgr
ading transmission pipeline to allow for the use of in-line inspection tools and continued its work on the final recommendationfrom the NTSB’s 2010-11 San Bruno investigation to hyd
rostatically test all high consequence pipeline mileage. The Utility currently plans to complete this NTSBrecommendation by 202
2 for remaining short pipeline segments that include tie-in pieces, fittings or smaller diameter off-takes from the larger transmissionpipelines.

Competition
Competition in the Electricit
y IndustryCalifornia law allows quali
fying non-residential electric customers of IOUs to purchase electricity from energy service providers rather than from the utilities up tocertain annual lim
its specified for each utility. This arrangement is known as “direct access,” or DA. In 2018, the California legislature passed a bill to expand theannual statewide DA cap by 4,000 GWh, and dire
cted the CPUC to consider whether DA should be further expanded, and to present a report on this matter to thelegislature by June 30, 2020. In addi
tion, California law permits cities, counties, and certain other public agencies that have qualified to become a CCA to generateand/or purchase elect
ricity for their local residents and businesses. By law, a CCA can procure electricity for all of its residents and businesses that do notaffirmatively e
lect to continue to receive electricity generated or procured by a utility. In 2019, the CPUC issued an order implementing the 4,000 GWh increasefor DA transactions, including an 
apportionment to the Utility’s service area of approximately 1,873 GWh.On September 28, 2020, the CPUC issued a report reco
mmending that further expansion of DA be conditioned on energy service providers’ demonstratedcompliance with the fol
lowing: (1) Integrated Resource Plan filings and meeting all procurement requirements, (2) RPS obligations for the 2021-2024 complianceperiod and (3) RA requirements 
including multi-year local, year-ahead flexible and system, and month-ahead system and flexible obligations.  The report alsorecommends setting an in
itial re-opening schedule in increments equal to 10% of eligible non-residential load per year beginning no earlier than 2024. The CPUCplans to issue a proposed decision 
in connection therewith in early 2021 and subsequently present its report to the California legislature. (1) (2)
(1) 
(2)
32

The Utility continues to provide transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services to direct access customers at the election of their energy service provider.The CCA customers continue to obtain t
ransmission, distribution, metering, and billing services from the Utility. In addition to collecting charges for transmission,distribution, metering, 
and billing services that it provides, the Utility is able to collect charges intended to recover the generation-related costs that the Utilityincurred on behalf of dir
ect access and CCA customers while they were the Utility’s customers. The Utility remains the electricity provider of last resort for thesecustomers. SB 520 (codified at Sec
tion 387 of the Public Utilities Code), which was signed by the governor and became law on October 2, 2019, allows for arequest to transfer th
e responsibilities of the provider of last resort obligation from IOUs to other entities.The Utility is also impac
ted by the increasing viability of distributed generation and energy storage. The levels of self-generation of electricity by customers(primarily solar ins
tallations) and the use of customer net energy metering (NEM), which allows self-generating customers employing qualifying renewableresources to receive b
ill credits at the full retail rate, are increasing, putting upward rate pressure on remaining customers. New NEM customers are required to payan interconnection fe
e, utilize time of use rates, and are required to pay certain non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the costs of low income, energyefficiency, and other p
rograms that other customers pay. Significantly higher bills for remaining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customersas they may seek altern
ative energy providers or adopt self-generation technologies. The CPUC initiated a proceeding to revisit the NEM tariff in 2020 and hasindicated that it an
ticipates reaching a decision on a revised tariff by the end of 2021.Further, in some circumst
ances, governmental entities such as cities and irrigation districts, which have authority under the state constitution or state statute toprovide retail ele
ctric service, may seek to acquire the Utility’s distribution facilities, through eminent domain. In 2020, one such entity communicated an interestin acquiring certain Ut
ility assets through a voluntary sale during the Chapter 11 Cases. It is also expected that some of the governmental entities will constructduplicate or new distribut
ion facilities to serve existing or potential new Utility customers. In some instances, microgrid formation is a key factor in a community’schoice to engage governmen
tal entities.The Utility also competes 
for the opportunity to develop and construct certain types of electric transmission facilities within, or interconnected to, its serviceterritory through a comp
etitive bidding process managed by the CAISO.The effect of such types of 
retail competition generally is to reduce the number of utility customers, leading to a reduction in the amount of electricity purchasedfrom the Utility.
(For risks in connection with inc
reasing competition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.)Competition in the Natural Gas Industry
The Utility competes with oth
er natural gas pipeline companies for customers transporting natural gas into the southern California market on the basis oftransportation rates, 
access to competitively priced supplies of natural gas, and the quality and reliability of transportation services. The Utility also competes forstorage services with othe
r third-party storage providers, primarily in northern California.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accountingpolicies described in M
D&A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results.  Thefollowing discussion of key risk fa
ctors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunctionwith MD&A and the Consolidated Financial St
atements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 2020 Form 10-K.  Any of these factors, in whole or in pa
rt, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, andcash flows.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s substantial indebtedness fo
llowing the emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases may adversely affect their financial healthand operating flexibility.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
a substantial amount of indebtedness as a result of the reorganization transactions in connection with implementation of thePlan, most of which is secured by li
ens on certain assets of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. As of December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation had approximately$4.71 billion of outstanding indebt
edness (such indebtedness consisting of the 2028 Notes, the 2030 Notes and borrowings under the PG&E Corporation TermLoan), and the Utility had approx
imately $31.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness (such indebtedness including the Utility Reinstated Senior Notes, the NewUtility Senior Notes, the Mortgag
e Bonds, and the Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement). In addition, PG&E Corporation had $500 million of additional borrowingcapacity under the Corpora
tion Revolving Credit Agreement, and the Utility had $1.9 billion of additional borrowing capacity under the Utility Revolving CreditAgreement. In addition, the Ut
ility had outstanding preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of $252 million.Since PG&E Corporation and the Utility h
ave a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations will be used to make payments on this debt.Furthermore, since a signi
ficant percentage of the Utility’s assets are used to secure its debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debtor credit support and reduc
es its flexibility in operating these secured assets. This relatively high level of debt and related security could have other importantconsequences for PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility, including:•
limiting their ability or increasing the costs to refinance their indebtedness;•
limiting their ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of their businessstrategy or other purposes;
•
limiting their ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of their business;•
increasing their vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given their substantialindebtedness that bears in
terest at variable rates, as well as to catastrophic events; and•
limiting their ability to capitalize on business opportunities.Under the terms of the agr
eements and indentures governing their respective indebtedness, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are permitted to incur additionalindebtedness, some of which could be s
ecured (subject to compliance with certain tests) and which could further accentuate these risks. As a result of the high levelof indebtedness, PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility may be unable to generate sufficient cash through operations to service such debt, and may need to refinancesuch indebtedness at or prior 
to maturity and be unable to obtain financing on suitable terms or at all, any of which could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s business, financial condition and results of operations.35

The documents that govern PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s indebtedness contain restrictions that limit their flexibility in operating their business.PG&E Corporatio
n’s and the Utility’s material financing agreements, including certain of their respective credit agreements and indentures, contain variouscovenants restricting, 
among other things, their ability to:•
incur or assume indebtedness or guarantees of indebtedness;•
incur or assume liens;•
sell or dispose of all or substantially all of its property or business;•
merge or consolidate with other companies;•
enter into any sale leaseback transactions; and•
enter into swap agreements.The restrictions conta
ined in these material financing agreements could affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to operate their business and may limittheir ability to re
act to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affectPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
ability to finance their operations and expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, sell assets,restructure their o
rganization or finance their capital needs. Additionally, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to comply with these covenants andrestrictions may be a
ffected by events beyond their control, including, but not limited to, prevailing regulatory, economic, financial and industry conditions.Parties have appealed the Confirmation Order.
Following entry of the Confirmat
ion Order confirming the Plan, certain parties filed notices of appeal with respect to the Confirmation Order. While a number ofsuch appeals have been dismiss
ed, there can be no assurance that any of the remaining appeals will not be successful and, if successful, that any such appeal wouldnot have a material 
adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility.PG&E Corporation may be required to issue shares with respect to Ho
ldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, which would result in dilution to holders of PG&ECorporation common stock, or pay a material amount of cash with resp
ect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims.On the Effective Date, PG&E Corporat
ion issued to the Fire Victim Trust a number of shares of common stock equal to 22.19% of the outstanding common stockon such date. As further describ
ed in “Satisfaction of HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordinated Debt Claims” in Note 14 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8, PG&E Corporation may be required to issue shares of its common stock in satisfaction of allowed HoldCo Rescissionor Damage Claims. If such issuan
ce is required, it may be determined that, under the Plan, the Fire Victim Trust should receive additional shares of PG&ECorporation common stock such tha
t it would have owned 22.19% of the outstanding common stock of reorganized PG&E Corporation on the Effective Date,assuming that such issuance of sh
ares in satisfaction of the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims had occurred on the Effective Date. Any such issuances willresult in dilution to anyone who holds sh
ares of PG&E Corporation common stock prior to such issuance and may cause the trading price of PG&E Corporationshares to decline.
Additionally, PG&E Corporation may be r
equired to pay a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims (as defined in “Satisfactionof HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordin
ated Debt Claims” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). Suchpayment may have a mat
erial adverse impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.36

Any substantial sale of stock by existing stockholders could depress the market value of PG&E Corporation’s common stock, thereby devaluing the marketprice and causing investors to risk losing all or part of 
their investment.Certain existing stockholde
rs, including the Fire Victim Trust, the PIPE Investors and the Backstop Parties, hold a large number of the outstanding shares of PG&ECorporation. PG&E Corporation can make no p
rediction as to the effect, if any, that sales of shares, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on theprevailing market pr
ice of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of common stock in the public market, or theperception that such sal
es could occur, could depress prevailing market prices for such shares. Such sales may also make it more difficult for PG&E Corporation tosell equity securities or e
quity-linked securities in the future at a time and price which it deems appropriate.PG&E Corporation may also sell addi
tional shares of common stock in subsequent offerings or issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertibleinto shares of PG&E Corporation common s
tock. The issuance of any shares of PG&E Corporation common stock in future financings, acquisitions uponconversion or exercise of 
convertible securities, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of PG&E Corporation's outstandingcommon stock. If PG&E Corporation issues 
any such additional shares, the issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of allcurrent shareholders. PG&E Corpora
tion cannot predict the size of future issuances of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock or securities convertible intoshares of PG&E Corporation common stock o
r, for any issuance, the effect, if any, that such future issuances will have on the market price of PG&E Corporation'scommon stock.
PG&E Corporation common stock is subject to ownership and transfer restric
tions intended to preserve PG&E Corporation’s ability to use its net operatingloss carryforwards and other tax attributes.
PG&E Corporation has incurred and may 
also continue to incur in connection with the Plan significant net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, theamount and availability of
 which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. The Amended Articles (as defined below) impose certainrestrictions on the tr
ansferability and ownership of PG&E Corporation common stock and preferred stock (together, the “capital stock”) and other interestsdesignated as “stock” of PG&E Corpora
tion by the Board of Directors as disclosed in an SEC filing (such stock and other interests, the “Equity Securities,” andsuch restrictions on trans
ferability and ownership, the “Ownership Restrictions”) in order to reduce the possibility of an equity ownership shift that could result inlimitations on PG&E Corporation’s 
ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes from prior taxable years or periods for federal incometax purposes. Any acquisition of PG&E Corporat
ion capital stock that results in a shareholder being in violation of these restrictions may not be valid.Subject to certain exc
eptions, the Ownership Restrictions restrict (i) any person or entity (including certain groups of persons) from directly or indirectly acquiringor accumulating 4.75% or mo
re of the outstanding Equity Securities and (ii) the ability of any person or entity (including certain groups of persons) alreadyowning, directly or indirec
tly, 4.75% or more of the Equity Securities to increase their proportionate interest in the Equity Securities (but see the immediatelyfollowing risk factor for 
more information). Any transferee receiving Equity Securities that would result in a violation of the Ownership Restrictions will not berecognized as a sharehold
er of PG&E Corporation or entitled to any rights of shareholders, including, without limitation, the right to vote and to receive dividendsor distributions, whether liqu
idating or otherwise, in each case, with respect to the Equity Securities causing the violation.The Ownership Restrictions rema
in in effect until the earliest of (i) the repeal, amendment or modification of Section 382 (and any comparable successorprovision) of the Interna
l Revenue Code, in a manner that renders the restrictions imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code no longer applicable toPG&E Corporation, (ii) the beginning o
f a taxable year in which the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation determines that no tax benefits attributable to netoperating losses or other t
ax attributes are available, (iii) the date selected by the Board of Directors if it determines that the limitation amount imposed by Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code as o
f such date in the event of an “ownership change” of PG&E Corporation (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal RevenueCode and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502
-91 et seq.) would not be materially less than the net operating loss carryforwards or “net unrealized built-in loss”(within the meaning of Sect
ion 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.) of PG&E Corporation and (iv) the dateselected by the Board of Dire
ctors if it determines that it is in the best interests of PG&E Corporation’s shareholders for the Ownership Restrictions to be removedor released. The Ownership Restri
ctions may also be waived by the Board of Directors on a case by case basis.37

If PG&E Corporation elects to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a “grantor trust,” the application of the Ownership Restrictions, as defined in PG&ECorporation’s Amended Articles of Incorporation, will be de
termined on the basis of a number of shares outstanding that could differ materially from thenumber of shares reported as outstanding on the cover page of its per
iodic reports under the Exchange Act.The Plan contemplates tha
t the Fire Victim Trust will be treated as a “qualified settlement fund” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to PG&ECorporation’s ability to e
lect to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a “grantor trust” for U.S. federal income tax purposes instead. In January 2021, PG&E Corporationreceived an IRS ruling that s
tates the Utility is eligible to make a grantor trust election with respect to the Fire Victim Trust and addressed certain, but not all,related issues. PG&E Corporation be
lieves benefits associated with “grantor trust” treatment could be realized, but only if PG&E Corporation and the Fire VictimTrust can meet cert
ain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder, relating to sales of PG&E Corporation stock.If PG&E Corporation were to elec
t to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a “grantor trust,” any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust would effectively be excludedfrom the total number o
f outstanding Equity Securities when calculating a Person’s Percentage Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) for purposes of theOwnership Restrictions. For example, whe
reas the number of outstanding shares of PG&E Corporation common stock for corporate purposes as of February 22,2021, was 1,984,683,820 shares, for purposes of the Ownership Rest
rictions, the number of outstanding common stock as of February 22, 2021, would be1,506,940,230 (the number of outstanding sha
res of PG&E Corporation common stock less the number of shares of common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trustas of February 22, 2021). PG&E Corporation does not con
trol the number of shares held by the Fire Victim Trust and is not able to determine in advance thenumber of shares the Fire Vic
tim Trust will hold. PG&E Corporation intends to periodically make available to investors information about the number of shares ofcommon stock held by the Fire Vic
tim Trust as of a specified date for purposes of the Ownership Restrictions, including in its Quarterly Reports and AnnualReports filed with the SEC.
PG&E Corporation expects to publicly 
announce its determination on whether it will elect to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a “grantor trust” no later than April 1,2021. In the event PG&E Corporation decid
es to make a “grantor trust” election with respect to the Fire Victim Trust, PG&E Corporation intends to enforce theOwnership Restrictions as describ
ed in the foregoing paragraph (excluding any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust from the number of outstanding EquitySecurities), including with 
respect to Transfers (as defined in the Amended Articles) occurring before such announcement. However, it is anticipated that the Boardof Directors of PG&E Corporation will 
exempt Transfers to shareholders occurring prior to July 30, 2020 (the date PG&E Corporation initially announced it wasconsidering treating th
e Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust in its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2020), solely to the extent that such Transferswould have complied with the Ownership Rest
rictions if the Ownership Restrictions were applied on the basis that the shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust weretreated as outstanding Equi
ty Securities. For the avoidance of doubt, all other Transfers of Equity Securities (including acquisitions from and after the July 30,2020 by shareholders benefiting 
from an exemption described in the preceding sentence) will continue to be subject to the Ownership Restrictions. All current andprospective shareholders 
are advised to consider the foregoing in determining their ownership and acquisition of PG&E Corporation common stock.The ability of PG&E Corporation to use some or all of i
ts net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future income may be limited.As of December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation had net ope
rating loss carryforwards for PG&E Corporation’s consolidated group for U.S. federal and Californiaincome tax purposes of approxi
mately $28.5 billion and $25.4 billion, respectively, and PG&E Corporation incurred and may also continue to incur in connectionwith the Plan significant ne
t operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. The ability of PG&E Corporation to use some or all of these net operating losscarryforwards and cert
ain other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (which also applies forCalifornia state inco
me tax purposes), if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” such net operating loss carryforwards and othertax attributes may be sub
ject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally fivepercent shareholders, app
lying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentage ownershipduring the testing peri
od (generally three years).38

As of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change and its net operating loss carryforwards andother tax attributes 
are not limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, whether PG&E Corporation underwent or will undergo an ownershipchange as a result of the 
transactions in PG&E Corporation’s equity that occurred pursuant to the Plan depends on several factors outside PG&E Corporation’scontrol and the applica
tion of certain laws that are uncertain in several respects. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS would not successfully assertthat PG&E Corporation has undergone or wil
l undergo an ownership change pursuant to the Plan. In addition, even if these transactions did not cause an ownershipchange, they may increas
e the likelihood that PG&E Corporation may undergo an ownership change in the future. If the IRS successfully asserts that PG&ECorporation did undergo, or PG&E Corporation oth
erwise does undergo, an ownership change, the limitation on its net operating loss carryforwards and other taxattributes under Section 382 o
f the Internal Revenue Code could be material to its operations.In particular, lim
itations imposed on PG&E Corporation’s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes could cause U.S. federal andCalifornia income tax
es to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating loss carryforwards or othertax attributes to expi
re unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. Specifically,PG&E Corporation’s ability to uti
lize its net operating loss carryforwards is critical to a successful rate-neutral securitization transaction, the proceeds of which areexpected to be used to satis
fy the Utility’s obligations to the Fire Victim Trust, and to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commitment to make certain operatingand capital expenditures.
 Failure to consummate a securitization transaction or obtain alternative sources of capital could have a material adverse effect on PG&ECorporation and the Utility and 
the value of PG&E Corporation common stock.The ability of PG&E Corporation to pay dividends on shares of PG&E Corporation common sto
ck is subject to restrictions.In response to concerns rais
ed by the California Governor, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed the Case Resolution Contingency Process Motion with theBankruptcy Court setting forth c
ertain commitments in connection with the confirmation process and implementation of the Plan, including, among other things,limitations on the abi
lity of PG&E Corporation to pay dividends on shares of its common stock (the “Dividend Restriction”). The Dividend Restriction providesthat PG&E Corporation may not pay divid
ends on shares of its common stock until it recognizes $6.2 billion in Non-GAAP Core Earnings following the EffectiveDate. “Non-GAAP Core Earnings” means GAAP earnings adjusted fo
r certain non-core items. Additionally, the ruling of the court overseeing the Utility’sprobation dated April 3, 2019 plac
es further restrictions on the ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to issue dividends. Under those terms of probation, nodividends may be issued until th
e Utility is fully in compliance with all applicable laws concerning vegetation management and clearance requirements, as well asthe vegetation management an
d enhanced vegetation management targets and metrics in the Utility’s WMP.Subject to the foregoing res
trictions, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and willdepend on, among other things, PG&E Corporation
’s results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that theBoard of Directors may deem 
relevant.39

PG&E Corporation is a holding company and relies on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from the Utility to meet itsobligations.
PG&E Corporation conducts its operat
ions primarily through its subsidiary, the Utility, and substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s consolidated assets are held bythe Utility. Accordingly, PG&E Corporat
ion’s cash flow and its ability to meet its debt service obligations under its existing and future indebtedness are largelydependent upon the earnings and c
ash flows of the Utility and the distribution or other payment of these earnings and cash flows to PG&E Corporation in the formof dividends or loans or advances 
and repayment of loans and advances from the Utility. The ability of the Utility to pay dividends or make other advances,distributions and transfe
rs of funds will depend on its results of operations and may be restricted by, among other things, applicable laws limiting the amount offunds available for paym
ent of dividends, the conditions of the Utility’s probation proceeding and certain restrictive covenants contained in the agreements of thosesubsidiaries. Additionally, th
e Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including its obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and intereston outstanding debt, to pay prefe
rred stock dividends and meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&E Corporation.Under the Utility’s Articl
es of Incorporation, the Utility cannot pay common stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility’s preferredstock have been paid. In addit
ion, the CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between PG&E Corporation and the Utility, includingfinancial conditions th
at require the Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and prudent tomeet the Utility’s obl
igation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. It is uncertain when PG&E Corporation and the Utility willcommence the payment o
f dividends on their common stock and when the Utility will commence the payment of dividends on its preferred stock. The deteriorationof income from, or other 
available assets of, the Utility for any reason could limit or impair the Utility’s ability to pay dividends or other distributions to PG&ECorporation, which could, in turn, ma
terially and adversely affect PG&E Corporation’s ability to meet its obligations.California law and certain provisions in the Amended Articles and the a
mended and restated bylaws of PG&E Corporation (the “Amended Bylaws”) mayprevent efforts by shareholders to change the dir
ection or management of the Company.The Amended Articles and the Amend
ed Bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of PG&E Corporation more difficult without the approval of theBoard of Directors, including, but no
t limited to, the following:•
until 2024, the Board of Directors will be divided into two equal classes, with members of each class elected in different years for different terms;•
only holders of shares who are entitled to cast ten percent or more of the votes can request a special meeting of the shareholders, and any such requestmust satisfy the requir
ements specified in the Amended Bylaws; action by shareholders may otherwise only be taken at an annual or special meeting dulycalled by or at the dir
ection of a majority of the Board of Directors;•
advance notice for all shareholder proposals is required; and•
any person acquiring PG&E Corporation Equity Securities will be restricted from owning more than 4.75% of such Equity Securities, subject to certainexpectations as may be de
termined by the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation.These and other provisions in the Am
ended Articles, the Amended Bylaws and California law could make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirersto obtain control of the Board o
f Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current Board of Directors, including delay or impede a merger, tenderoffer or proxy contest involv
ing PG&E Corporation. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of PG&E Corporation common stock andlimit opportunities for s
hareholders to realize value in a corporate transaction.40

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows have been and could continue to be significantlyaffected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows have been (beginning in March 2020) and could continueto be significantly af
fected by the outbreak of COVID-19, but the extent of such impact is uncertain. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19)was reported to have surfac
ed in Wuhan, China, resulting in significant disruptions to manufacturing, supply chain, markets, and travel world-wide. On January 30,2020, the International Hea
lth Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergencyof international conc
ern and on March 12, 2020, announced the outbreak was a pandemic. In response to the California Governor’s emergency proclamation onMarch 4, 2020, the Utility extend
ed a disconnection moratorium to residential and small business customers. On April 16, 2020, the CPUC approved a resolutionrequiring utilities 
to extend this disconnection moratorium through April 16, 2021. On February 11, 2021, the CPUC extended the moratorium for residential andsmall business customers to Jun
e 30, 2021. On December 21, 2020, a CPUC ALJ issued a ruling seeking comments on an approach to implement a temporarymoratorium on service d
isconnections for medium-large commercial and industrial customers. On February 11, 2021, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking proceedingto consider arrearag
e relief for utility customers who will have outstanding utility bills when the moratorium on service disconnections ends, some of the costs ofwhich could be funded by shareholders.
While the extent of th
e impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business and financial results is uncertain, theconsequences of a continued and p
rolonged outbreak and resulting government and regulatory orders have had and could continue to have a further negativeimpact on the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.The outbreak of COVID-19 and the resulting 
economic conditions, including but not limited to the shelter-in-place orders, as such orders may be imposed fromtime to time, and resu
lting decrease in economic and industrial activity in the Utility’s service territory have and will continue to have a significant adverse impacton the Utility’s customers
; these circumstances have impacted and will continue to impact the Utility for a period of time that PG&E Corporation and the Utilityare unable to predict. For 
example, the economic downturn has resulted in a reduction in customer receipts and collection delays in the second, third and fourthquarters of 2020.
The Utility’s customer en
ergy accounts receivable balances over 30 days outstanding as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $825 million, or $478 millionhigher as compared to the b
alances as of December 31, 2019. The Utility is unable to estimate the portion of the increase directly attributable to the COVID-19pandemic. The Utility expe
cts to continue experiencing an impact on monthly cash collections in 2021 and for as long as current COVID-19 circumstances persist.On April 16, 2020, the CPUC passed a resolution requiring COVID-19 re
lated emergency customer protection measures starting from the March 4, 2020Emergency Proclamation 
and consistent with the March 16, 2020 Executive Order, through April 16, 2021. On February 11, 2021, the CPUC approved a resolutionextending these protect
ions to June 30, 2021. The April 16, 2020 resolution allows associated costs to be tracked in a memorandum account, the CPPMA. TheCPPMA allows tracking of residential 
and small business customers’ incremental uncollectible costs. It is anticipated that implementation of the February 11, 2021resolution will provide for 
the same treatment. In addition, the Utility’s 2020 GRC final decision would continue the Utility’s existing mechanism to addressuncollectibles, which al
lows the Utility to readjust its uncollectibles rate on an annual basis based on the most recent 10-year average of uncollectibles. In addition,the June 11, 2020 decision in the OIR to Consider New Approa
ches to Disconnections and Reconnections to Improve Energy Access and Contain Costs(Disconnections OIR) provides for a 
two-way balancing account for residential uncollectibles and memorandum account for OIR implementation costs. The Utilityis unable to predict whethe
r these measures will allow for future recovery of these amounts.In addition, the Utility has 
experienced average reductions of approximately two percent in electric load and approximately two percent in core gas load on aweather-adjusted basis f
rom mid-March 2020 through December 2020, resulting in an estimated $430 million reduction in billed revenues for the mid-March 2019to the December 2020 period. On Janua
ry 1, 2021, electric rates were reset using sales that were adjusted for COVID-19 impacts and significant ongoing shortfallsare not currently expe
cted in 2021. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are currently unable to quantify the long-term potential impact of the changes in customercollections or changes in 
energy demand on earnings and cash flows due, in part, to uncertainties regarding the timing, duration and intensity of the COVID-19outbreak and the resulting 
economic downturn. Although the CPUC authorized the establishment of memorandum and balancing accounts to track costs associatedwith customer protection 
measures, the timing of regulatory relief, if any, and ultimately cost recovery from such accounts or otherwise, are uncertain.41

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic downturn have resulted and will continue to result in workforce disruptions, both in personnel availability(including a reduction in 
contract labor resources) and deployment. In preparation for the return of a few teams to their offices, the Utility has issued a “Return toPG&E Playbook” that explains the saf
ety-related steps the company is taking, as well as the steps that PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s employees shouldtake. The guidance includes 
important reminders of policies on personal hygiene, travel, reporting exposure or illness, and other topics.Although the Utility continues to p
rioritize customer and community safety, these disruptions necessitate changes to the Utility’s operating and capital expenditureplans, which could lead to proje
ct delays or service disruptions in certain programs. Delays in production and shipping of materials used in the Utility’s operationsmay also impact operations.
In addition, as discussed above, a g
roup of local government entities and organizations filed a Joint Motion asking the CPUC to require utilities to comply withadditional requirem
ents when implementing PSPS events while local areas are sheltering-in-place due to COVID-19. The requested requirements includedproviding back-up generation 
to essential services and allowing local governments to veto PSPS events for their areas. The Utility and other entities (including theother IOUs) filed responses on April 20, 2020, 
requesting that the CPUC deny the motion, and the moving parties and other entities filed responses on April 24,2020. On August 24, 2020, the ALJ issued a decision holding the Apri
l 13, 2020 joint motion in abeyance, finding that the May 28, 2020 decision dealt with manyof the issues raised. If th
e motion were reinstated in the future, a CPUC decision could restrict or impose additional requirements on the Utility in implementingPSPS events.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility expe
ct additional financial impacts in the future as a result of COVID-19. Potential longer-term impacts of COVID-19 onPG&E Corporation or the Utility inc
lude the potential for higher credit spreads and borrowing costs and incremental financing needs. PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s analysis of the po
tential impact of COVID-19 is ongoing and subject to change. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the timing,duration or intensity of th
e COVID-19 situation, the timing, duration or intensity of any resurgence of COVID-19 and any variant strains of the COVID-19 virus,the effectiveness and 
intensity of measures to contain COVID-19 (including availability and effectiveness of vaccines), and the effects of the COVID-19 situationon the business, financial cond
ition and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility and on the business and general economic conditions in the Stateof California and the United St
ates of America.Risks Related to Wildfires
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could b
e materially affected if the Utility does not maintain an AB 1054 safety certification or isotherwise unable to access the Wildfire Fund.
On January 14, 2021, the WSD issued the Utility’s 2020 Sa
fety Certification, which under AB 1054 entitles the Utility to certain benefits, including eligibility for acap on Wildfire Fund reimbu
rsement and for a reformed prudent manager standard. The 2020 Safety Certification is valid for 12 months, or until a timely requestfor a new safety certi
fication is acted upon, whichever occurs later.The AB 1054 Wildfire Fund disallowance c
ap, which caps the amount of liability that the Utility could be required to bear for a catastrophic wildfire, isinapplicable if the Wildfire F
und administrator determines that the electric utility company’s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted“conscious or willful
 disregard for the rights and safety of others,” or the electric utility company fails to maintain a valid safety certification at the time theapplicable wildfire 
ignited. The inability to maintain an AB 1054 safety certification and, as a result, the inaccessibility of the disallowance cap on reimbursementto the Wildfire Fund, could hav
e a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Inaddition, if the Utility h
as failed to maintain a valid safety certificate at the time a wildfire ignites, the initial burden of proof in a prudency proceeding shifts fromintervenors to the Utili
ty.Furthermore, the Wildf
ire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Suchfunds could be depleted more qu
ickly than expected, including as a result of claims made by California’s other participating electric utility companies. PG&ECorporation and the Utility wil
l not benefit from all of the features of AB 1054 if the Wildfire Fund is exhausted, which could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, resul
ts of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected as a result of the 2019Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire or future wildfir
es.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected as a result of the 2019Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fir
e or future wildfires.42

Based on the facts and circumstances available as of the date of this report, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have determined that it is probable they will incur aloss in connection with the 2019 Kincad
e fire and the 2020 Zogg fire. Although PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded liabilities for probable losses inconnection with such wildfires, 
these liability estimates correspond to the lower end of the range of reasonably estimable losses, do not include several categoriesof potential damages th
at are not reasonably estimable, and are subject to change based on new information.Although there are a number o
f unknown facts surrounding Cal Fire’s causation determination of the 2019 Kincade fire and Cal Fire’s investigation of the 2020Zogg fire, the Utility could b
e subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage or amounts available under the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 thatwould be expected to have a ma
terial impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. PG&ECorporation and the Utility hav
e also received and have responded or are responding to data requests from the CPUC’s SED relating to the 2019 Kincade fire andthe 2020 Zogg fire. Furthermore, 
the Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office and the Shasta County District Attorney’s Office are conducting investigationsinto the 2019 Kincade fire and 
the 2020 Zogg fire, respectively. PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of additional investigations, lawsuits, orenforcement actions 
in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire or future wildfires.Although the Utility has taken ex
tensive measures to reduce the threat of future wildfires, the potential that the Utility’s equipment will be involved in the ignitionof future wildfires, inc
luding catastrophic wildfires, is significant. This risk may be attributable to, and exacerbated by, a variety of factors, including climate (inparticular extended p
eriods of seasonal dryness coupled with periods of high wind velocities and other storms), infrastructure, and vegetation conditions. See“Risks related to environm
ental factors—Severe weather conditions, extended drought and shifting climate patterns could materially affect PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s financ
ial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.” Despite significant investment in mitigation measures to improveinfrastructure and manage ve
getation, as well as implementation of de-energization strategies, the Utility may not be successful in mitigating the risk of futurewildfires.
In addition, the 2019 Kincade fi
re and the 2020 Zogg fire have had and, along with any future wildfires could continue to have adverse consequences on theUtility’s probation proce
eding, the Utility’s proceedings with the CPUC and the FERC (including the Safety Culture OII), and future regulatory proceedings,including future applic
ations for the safety certification required by AB 1054. PG&E Corporation and the Utility may also suffer additional reputational harm andface an even more cha
llenging operating, political, and regulatory environment as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, 2020 Zogg fire or any future wildfires. Formore information about 
the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2020 Zogg fire, see Note 14 “Wildfire-Related Contingencies” in Part II, Item 8.If the Utility is unable to recov
er all or a significant portion of its excess costs in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire and 2019 Kincade fire through ratemakingmechanisms and in a timely manner, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utilit
y’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could bematerially affected.
The Utility could incur substan
tial costs in excess of insurance coverage in the future in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2020 Zogg fire.There can be no assurance th
at the Utility will be allowed to recover costs in excess of insurance, including costs recorded in those accounts in the future, even if acourt decision were to
 determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation.The inability to recove
r all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collecting such rates in a timely manner couldhave a material e
ffect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.43

The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand thepotential liabilities 
from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, andcash flows.
California law includes a do
ctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liabilityfor attorneys’ fees) 
for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities’ electric transmission lines. Courtshave imposed liability und
er the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the grounds that losses borne bythe person whose property was damaged 
through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefitted from such undertaking, and basedon the assumption that util
ities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers. Plaintiffs have asserted and continue to assert the doctrine of inversecondemnation in lawsuits re
lated to certain wildfires that occurred in the Utility’s service territory, including the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2020 Zogg fire. Whilethe Utility currently 
continues to dispute the applicability of inverse condemnation to the Utility, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful inchallenging the applic
ability of inverse condemnation in the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire or other litigation against PG&E Corporation or the Utility.For example, a court could de
termine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies even in the absence of an open CPUC proceeding for cost recovery, orbefore a potential cos
t recovery decision is issued by the CPUC. Although the imposition of liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation is premised on theassumption that utilit
ies have the ability to automatically recover these costs from their customers, there can be no assurance that the CPUC would authorize costrecovery whether or not a pr
evious court decision had imposed liability on a utility under the doctrine of inverse condemnation. (In December 2017, the CPUCdenied recovery of costs th
at San Diego Gas & Electric Company stated it had incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inversecondemnation principles o
f strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC’s prudent manager standard. That determination was challenged by San Diego Gas &Electric as well as by th
e Utility and Southern California Edison. In October 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case, effectively ending thechallenge.)
If PG&E Corporation or the Utility we
re to be found liable for damages under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, but the Utility was unable to secure a costrecovery decision from 
the CPUC to pay for such costs through increases in rates or to collect such rates in a timely manner, the financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Utility would be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2019Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fir
e or any future wildfires. (See “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows could be material
ly affected as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire or future wildfires.” above.)PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could b
e materially affected as a result of the Utility’s implementation of its PSPS program.As outlined in the 2020 WMP, PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility have adopted the PSPS program to proactively de-energize lines that traverse areas underelevated and extrem
e risks for wildfire when forecasts predict extreme fire-threat conditions. The Utility carried out nine PSPS events in 2019 and six in 2020. Inaddition to the 2019 and 2020 PSPS events, the Utili
ty expects that PSPS events will be necessary in 2021 and future years.These PSPS events have been subject to signi
ficant scrutiny and criticism by various stakeholders, including the California Governor, the CPUC and the courtoverseeing the Utility’s p
robation. The Utility also is the subject of a scrutiny by the CPUC and of a class action litigation in connection with the 2019 PSPS eventsthat was filed in the Bankrupt
cy Court in December of 2019. On August 14, 2020, the assigned ALJ issued a scoping memo and ruling in the 2019 ERRACompliance proceeding tha
t established a Phase II of the proceeding to address the impacts of PSPS events that occurred in the Utility’s service territory in 2019and how the PSPS impacted its revenue col
lections. To date, the assigned ALJ has not initiated the Phase II.44

PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of the various proceedings and litigation in connection with the PSPS events. PG&ECorporation and the Utility cou
ld be subject to additional investigations, regulatory proceedings or other enforcement actions as well as to additional litigation andclaims by customers as a 
result of the Utility’s implementation of its PSPS program, which could result in fines, penalties, customer rebates or other payments. Theamount of any fines, penalt
ies, customer rebates or other payments (if PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to issue any credits, rebates or other payments inconnection with any other PSPS events (whethe
r past events or in the future)) or liability for damages could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the PSPS program has had an adverse impact on PG&E Corporation’s andthe Utility’s reputat
ion with customers, regulators and policymakers and future PSPS events may increase these negative perceptions. (For more information, see“Regulatory Matters” in 
Item 7. MD&A).Risks Related to the Outcome of Other Enforc
ement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory ProceedingsPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, resul
ts of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of furthernon-compliance with the terms of probation or in the e
vent of further modifications to the conditions of probation.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of further non-compliance with the te
rms of probation or in the event of further modifications to the conditions of probation. On January 26, 2017, following the federal criminaltrial against the Uti
lity in connection with the San Bruno explosion, in which the Utility was found guilty on six felony counts, the Utility was sentenced to, amongother things, a five-yea
r corporate probation period and oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early terminationafter three years.
From 2018 to 2020, the court overseeing 
the Utility’s probation issued various orders related to the Utility’s probation, including a finding that the Utility hadviolated a condition of i
ts probation with respect to reporting requirements, and imposing new conditions of probation. For more information about the Utility’sprobation and the court’s ord
ers, see “Enforcement Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.The Utility could incur ma
terial costs, not recoverable through rates, in the event of further non-compliance with the terms of its probation and in connection withthe monitorship (including bu
t not limited to costs resulting from recommendations of the third-party monitor). The Utility could also incur material costs, notrecoverable through ra
tes, in the event of further modifications to the conditions of its probation, such as those proposed by the court overseeing the Utility’sprobation on December 29, 2020 and Februa
ry 4, 2021, relating to de-energizing certain distribution circuits during PSPS events based on the presence of certainvegetation, and on February 18, 2021, re
lating to removing all trees or portions thereof, without regard to their health, if they are leaning towards a distribution lineand could either fall on 
the line or contact the line from the side.The outcome of probation could h
arm the Utility’s relationships with customers, regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies andmake it more difficult to recruit 
qualified personnel and senior management. Further, it could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatoryproceedings and result in in
creased regulatory or legislative scrutiny, including with respect to various aspects of how the Utility’s business is conducted ororganized. (See “Enforce
ment and Litigation Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.)PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could b
e materially affected as a result of an Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process.On November 24, 2020, the Utility rece
ived a letter (the “Letter”) from the President of the CPUC, expressing concerns related to the Utility’s vegetationmanagement and asset m
anagement activities and explaining potential implications with respect to the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process adopted bythe CPUC in its decision approving PG&E Corporation’s 
and the Utility’s Plan, as well as the Utility’s annual safety certification under AB 1054. According to theLetter, the President of 
the CPUC has “directed CPUC staff to conduct fact-finding to determine whether a recommendation to place [the Utility] into the enhancedoversight and enforcemen
t process is warranted.” On January 14, 2021, the WSD issued the Utility’s 2020 Safety Certification pursuant to AB 1054. The safetycertification is s
eparate from the CPUC’s enforcement authority and does not preclude the CPUC from pursuing remedies for safety or other applicable violations.45

The Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process is a six-step process with potentially escalating CPUC oversight and enforcement measures based on specific“triggering events” id
entified for each of the six steps. If the Utility is placed into the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process, it will be subject to additionalreporting requiremen
ts and additional monitoring and oversight by the CPUC. Higher steps of the process (Steps 3-6) also contemplate additional enforcementmechanisms, including appoin
tment of an independent third-party monitor, appointment of a chief restructuring officer, pursuit of the receivership remedy, andreview of the Utility’s Cer
tificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (i.e., its license to operate as a utility). The process contains provisions for the Utility tocure and exit the process 
if it can satisfy specific criteria. The Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process states that the Utility should presumptively movethrough the steps of the process s
equentially, but the CPUC may place the Utility into the appropriate step of the process upon occurrence of a specified triggeringevent.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could b
e materially affected as a result of legislative and regulatory developments.Pursuant to Article 5.8 of the Publi
c Utilities Code, on April 30, 2020, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a post-emergencetransaction to securi
tize $7.5 billion of 2017 wildfire claims costs that is designed to be rate neutral to customers, with the proceeds used to pay or reimburse theUtility for the payment o
f wildfire claims costs associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. As a result of the proposed transaction, the Utility wouldretire $6.0 billion of Uti
lity debt and accelerate a $592 million payment due to the Fire Victim Trust. Failure to consummate a securitization transaction could havea material eff
ect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. (See “Regulatory Matters - OtherRegulatory Proceedings” in It
em 7. MD&A.)In addition, the Public Utili
ties Code requires utilities to submit annual WMPs for approval by the CPUC on a schedule to be established by the CPUC. If theCPUC rejects the Utility’s WMP submit
tal, the Utility would become unable to obtain an AB 1054 safety certification and, as a result, become unable to access theWildfire Fund, which could have a 
material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Thestatute establishes f
actors to be considered by the CPUC when setting penalties for failure to substantially comply with the plan. Failure to substantially complywith the plan could result in 
fines and other penalties imposed on the Utility that could be material. (See “Regulatory Matters – Other Regulatory Proceedings” inItem 7. MD&A.)
On July 12, 2019, the California Governor signed 
into law AB 1054, which, among other policy reforms, provides for the establishment of a statewide fund that isavailable for eligible electric utility c
ompanies to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12, 2019 that are caused by theapplicable elect
ric utility company’s equipment. Although PG&E Corporation and the Utility contributed in accordance with AB 1054, an initial contribution ofapproximately $4.8 billion 
and first annual contribution of approximately $193 million to the Wildfire Fund on the Effective Date of the Plan to allow participationof the Utility therein, 
the impact of AB 1054 on PG&E Corporation and the Utility is subject to numerous uncertainties, including the Utility’s ability todemonstrate to the CPUC that wildfi
re-related costs paid from the Wildfire Fund are just and reasonable, subject to a disallowance cap, and that the Wildfire Fundhas sufficient rema
ining funds. The Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in theWildfire Fund. Such funds could be depl
eted more quickly than expected, including as a result of claims made by California’s other participating electric utilitycompanies. (See also, “PG&E Corporat
ion’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility does not maintain an AB1054 safetycertification or 
is otherwise unable to access the Wildfire Fund.” above.)The costs of participat
ing in the Wildfire Fund are expected to exceed $6.7 billion over the anticipated ten-year life of the fund. The timing and amount of anypotential charges assoc
iated with the Utility’s contributions would also depend on various factors. In addition, there could also be a significant delay between theoccurrence of a wildfi
re and the timing on which the Utility recognizes impairment for the reduction in future coverage, due to the lack of data available to theUtility following a cata
strophic event, especially if the wildfire occurs in the service territory of another participating electric utility. Participation in the WildfireFund is expected to have a mat
erial impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows, and therecan be no assurance that th
e benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund ultimately outweigh these substantial costs.Finally, AB 1054 revised some of the SB 901 requir
ements regarding WMPs, including creating a WSD to review future plans and that plans should cover a three-year period.

In June 2018, the State of California enacted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, with a 12-month look-back period requiring compliance byJanuary 1, 2019. On October 11, 2019, the State of Cal
ifornia announced proposed regulations which provide guidance on the requirements of the CCPA. TheCCPA requires companies that process 
information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharingpractices, allows consume
rs to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA provides forfinancial penalti
es in the event of non-compliance and statutory damages in the event of a data security breach. On November 3, 2020, Californians voted toapprove Proposition 24, a ballot m
easure that creates the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). The CPRA, which will become effective on January 1, 2023,amends and expands the CCPA. Failure to comply wi
th the CCPA and the CPRA could result in fines imposed on PG&E Corporation and the Utility that could bematerial.
Also, on September 10, 2018, the Californi
a Governor signed into law SB 100 (the 100 Percent Clean Energy Act of 2018), which increased the percentage from50% to 60% of California’s e
lectricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030; and establishes state policy that 100% of all retail electricity sales mustcome from renewable por
tfolio standard-eligible or carbon-free resources by 2045. Failure to comply with SB 100 could result in fines imposed on PG&ECorporation and the Utility th
at could be material and could also result in negative publicity.Finally, on June 30, 2020, the California Gove
rnor signed into law SB 350 (the Golden State Energy Act), a bill which authorizes the creation by the Governor of anew entity, “Golden State Energy,” 
a nonprofit public benefit corporation, for the purpose of acquiring the Utility’s assets and serving electric and gas in theUtility’s service te
rritory only in the event that the CPUC determines that the Utility’s Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity should be revoked pursuantto any process or procedures adop
ted by the CPUC in its decision approving PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Plan of Reorganization.The Utility is subject to ext
ensive regulations and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations. PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility’s financial condit
ion, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC’sinvestigative enforcem
ent proceedings against the Utility, other known enforcement matters, and other ongoing state and federal investigations and requestsfor information.
The Utility is subject to ex
tensive regulations, including federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcementproceedings in connection with 
compliance with such regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection withthe order to show cause rela
ted to the 2019 PSPS events, the OII related to the 2019 PSPS events, the safety culture OII, and other matters that the CPUC’s SEDmay be investigating. The SED could l
aunch investigations at any time on any issue it deems appropriate.The Utility could be subject 
to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws,regulations or orders tha
t could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacyrequirements; customer billing;
 customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safetyand inspection practic
es; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; andenvironmental compli
ance. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safetycitation programs. The a
mount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility also is a targ
et of a number of investigations, in addition to certain investigations in connection with the wildfires. (See “Risks Related to Wildfires,”above.) The Utility is unable 
to predict the outcome of pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility, or the amount ofany costs and expenses associat
ed with such investigations.If these investigations 
result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties the amount of which could be substantialand, in the event of a judgmen
t against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations,or future enforcement actions
, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; forexample, by enabling part
ies to challenge the Utility’s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility’s violations. (See also“PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of further non-compliance with the te
rms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation” above.)47

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results primarily depend on the outcomes of regulatory and ratemaking proceedings and the Utility’s ability tomanage its operating expenses and capital expendi
tures so that it is able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner.As a regulated entity, the Ut
ility’s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficientrevenues to recover re
asonable costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial resultscould be materially 
affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn itsauthorized ROE. The outcome of the Ut
ility’s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties;potential rate imp
acts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility’sregulators, consumer and oth
er stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility’s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gasservices. Further, an incr
ease in the amount of capacity located in the Utility’s service territory that is procured by the CAISO could increase the Utility’s costs ofprocuring capacity need
ed for reliable service to its customers.In addition to the amount of 
authorized revenues, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility’s actual costs tosafely and reliably se
rve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing marketcircumstances, unanti
cipated events (such as wildfires, storms, earthquakes, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility’s operations), orcompliance with new state 
laws or policies. Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial delaybetween when the Utility incurs 
the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs. Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC maydisallow costs that they det
ermine were not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility.The Utility also is requir
ed to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of astate-wide electric vehicle chargin
g infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energyefficiency programs, 
energy storage and renewable energy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the California high-speed rail project. TheUtility’s ability to r
ecover costs, including its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will depend, in large part, on thefinal form of legislative or re
gulatory requirements, and the associated ratemaking mechanisms associated with these initiatives, including the timely adjustment ofsuch mechanisms to reflect a
ny lowered customer demand for the Utility’s electricity and natural gas services.PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results dep
end upon the Utility’s continuing ability to recover “pass-through” costs, including electricity andnatural gas procurement costs, from customers in a ti
mely manner. The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In addition, theUtility’s ability to r
ecover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth, if the CPUC fails to adjust theUtility’s rates to refl
ect such events.The Utility meets customer
 demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility’s own generation facilities, electricityprovided by third parties unde
r power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market. The Utility must manage these sources using thecommercial and CPUC regulatory p
rinciples of “least cost dispatch” and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procur
ement plan. The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not complywith these principles or i
f the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan.Further, the contractual 
prices for electricity under the Utility’s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a varietyof reasons, including developm
ents in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lowercustomer demand due to adve
rse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility’s customers to other retail providers. Despite the CPUC’s current approval of thecontracts, the CPUC could disallow contr
act costs in the future if it determines that the terms of such contracts, including price, do not meet the CPUCreasonableness standard.
The Utility’s ability to 
recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continuesto function effectively. 
Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems andsoftware on which the market 
mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices. The CPUC could prohibit the Utilityfrom passing through the higher 
costs of electricity to customers.48

Further, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs throughmunicipalization of 
the Utility’s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs that provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumerswho become direct access 
customers of alternative generation providers. (See “Competition in the Electricity Industry” in Item 1.) As the number of bundledcustomers (i.e., those custo
mers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as theUtility would have a smalle
r customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs. Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable chargesfor above market gener
ation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover these costs. Inaddition, the Utility’s ab
ility to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups. Furthermore, if theformer customers return to recei
ving electricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timelyrecover through rates or 
that it may not be able to recover at all.In addition, increasing l
evels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customers to 
receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers, who may incur significantlyhigher bills due to an incr
ease in customers seeking alternative energy providers.A confluence of technology-r
elated cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage aviable, cost-effective alternative to
 the Utility’s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility’s ability to recover its generation, transmission,and distribution investmen
ts. If the number of the Utility’s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility’s level of authorized capitalinvestment could declin
e as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due tocustomer migration to o
ther energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation,unless substantially offse
t through regulatory cost allocations, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business, financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows.Further, changes in commodity p
rices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility’s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE.Although the Utility general
ly recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as “pass-through” costs, a significant and sustained rise incommodity prices could create
 overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as “pass-through” costs.To relieve some of this upward 
rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery.If the Utility is unable 
to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of changingloads, the wide deployment of dis
tributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies, PG&E Corporation’s andthe Utility’s financi
al condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology
The Utility’s electri
city and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks which, if they materialize, can materially affectPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, resul
ts of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility owns and operates ext
ensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generatingsystem. (See “Electri
c Utility Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations” in Item 1. Business above.) The Utility’s ability to earn its authorized ROEdepends on its abilit
y to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably. The Utilityundertakes substantial ca
pital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated todecommission its elec
tricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives, and the CPUC approved retirement of Diablo Canyon by 2024 and 2025.The Utility’s ability to s
afely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond theUtility’s control, includ
ing those that arise from:•
the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines or other assets orgroup of assets, that can caus
e explosions, fires, public or workforce safety issues, large scale system disruption or other catastrophic events;49

•an overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow correct operatingprocedures, or welding or fabr
ication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or distribution assets anduncontained natural gas f
low;•
the failure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gasoutages, gas surges back into homes, s
erious personal injury or loss of life;•
a prolonged statewide electrical black-out that results in damage to the Utility’s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other thirdparties;
•
the failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for employees or the public, environmentaldamage, or reputationa
l damage;•
the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act;•
the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility’s assets are built;•
the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonablyshould have identified, as unsa
fe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wildfire or natural gas explosion);•
inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm orextended outages;
•
operator or other human error;•
a motor vehicle incident involving a Utility vehicle (or one operated on behalf of the Utility) resulting in serious injuries to or fatalities of the workforceor the public, property dam
age, or other consequences;•
an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudently;•
construction performed by third parties that damages the Utility’s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or “dig-ins” that damage the Uti
lity’s underground pipelines;•
the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking lead-based paint from the 
Utility’s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and•
attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war.The occurrence of any 
of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generatingoutput; damage the Utili
ty’s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customersor others; and cause persona
l injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and tocompensate third part
ies. Any of such incidents also could lead to significant claims against the Utility.Further, although the Utility o
ften enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities, vegetationmanagement, or the constr
uction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor’s work and can besubject to penalties or o
ther enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders. The Utility may also be subject to liability,penalties or other enfo
rcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions.Insurance, equipment 
warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery underall circumstances o
r against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.50

The Utility’s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather eventsand events resulting from these conditions (inc
luding wildfires), or may not be available at a reasonable cost, or available at all.The Utility has experienc
ed increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires and other risks that could arise from the Utility’s ordinaryoperations. PG&E Corporation, the Util
ity or its contractors and customers could continue to experience coverage reductions and/or increased insurance costs infuture years. No assurance c
an be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of the Utility’s insurance coverage. Uninsured losses and increases in the costof insurance may not be re
coverable in customer rates. A loss that is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.As a result of the potentia
l application to IOUs of a strict liability standard under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, recent losses recorded by insurancecompanies, past wildfires 
and the risk of increased wildfires including as a result of climate change, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurancecoverage in the future 
at a reasonable cost, or at all. In addition, the Utility is unable to predict whether it would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costsof insurance or the costs of 
any uninsured losses. Also, the Utility will not be able to obtain any recovery from the Wildfire Fund for wildfire-related losses in anyyear that do not exceed th
e greater of $1.0 billion in the aggregate and the amount of insurance coverage required under AB 1054. The Wildfire Fund would beavailable to the Utility to
 pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from future wildfires and would serve as an alternative to traditional insurance products,provided that the Utility s
atisfies the conditions to the Utility’s ongoing participation in the Wildfire Fund set forth in AB 1054 and that the Wildfire Fund hassufficient remain
ing funds. (See “Insurance Coverage” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)If the amount of insuranc
e is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost or recover in rates the costs ofany uninsured losses, PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.The electric power and gas industries are undergoing significant 
changes driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy, which couldmaterially affect 
the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The electric power indust
ry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice (for example, customer-ownedgeneration and energy stor
age) and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy. The electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of new energytechnologies that support Cal
ifornia’s climate change and GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported by California policymakers.California's environment
al policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of the industry change. For instance, SB 100, which was signed into law onSeptember 10, 2018, increases f
rom 50% to 60%, the percentage of California’s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030. SB 100 establishes afurther goal to have an e
lectric grid that is entirely powered by clean energy by 2045. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment by customersand third parties of DERs, such as on-si
te solar generation, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies. These developmentswill require moderniz
ation of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity, increase the grid’s capacity, andinterconnect DERs.
In order to enable the 
California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiencyprograms, energy storage opt
ions, EV infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g., rail and water projects).To this end, the CPUC is conducting proceedings to
: evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higherpenetration of DERs and, consider fu
ture grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by DERs,and if feasible, what, if 
any, compensation to utilities would be appropriate for enabling those investments; and clarify the role of the electric distribution gridoperator. The CPUC also authorized deve
lopment of two new, five-year programs aimed at accelerating widespread electric vehicle adoption and combatingclimate change. The new prog
rams will increase fast charging options for consumers as well as electric charging infrastructure for non-light-duty fleet vehicles.51

In addition, in light of the state’s commitment to clean energy and carbon neutral economy by 2045, California has recently proposed public policies that prohibitor restrict the use and 
consumption of natural gas, for example in buildings, that will have for effect to reduce the use of natural gas. Reducing natural gas usecould lead to a reduction 
in the gas customer base and a diminished need for gas infrastructure and, as a result, could lead to certain gas assets no longer be “usedand useful,” potentially 
causing substantial investment value of gas assets to be stranded. (Under CPUC precedent, when an asset no longer meets the standard of“used and useful,” the asset 
is removed from rate base, which may result in a reduction in associated rate recovery.) However, while natural gas demand isprojected to decline ov
er time, the costs of operating a safe and reliable gas delivery system in California have been increasing, among other things, to cover thecost of long-term pipel
ine safety enhancements. Inability by the Utility to recover in rates its investments into the natural gas system while still ensuring gas systemsafety and reliability could
 materially affect the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The industry changes, costs associ
ated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility’sinability to successful
ly adapt to changes in the electric and gas industry, could materially affect the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,and cash flows.
A cyber incident, cyber security br
each, severe natural event or physical attack on the Utility’s operational networks and information technology systems couldhave a material effect on i
ts financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility’s electr
icity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communicationtechnologies, which can be dam
aged by natural events-such as severe weather or seismic events-and by malicious events, such as cyber and physical attacks.Private and public entit
ies, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the U.S. Federal government, including the Departments of Defense,Homeland Security and Energy, and th
e White House, have noted that cyber-attacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, andfrequency. The Utility’s ope
rational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure with newtechnologies and control syst
ems. Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility’s operational networks could cause harm to the public or employees,significantly disrupt ope
rations, negatively impact the Utility’s ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas or otherwise operate in themost safe and effici
ent manner or at all, and damage the Utility’s assets or operations or those of third parties.The Utility also relies on 
complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information,including the Utility’s f
inancial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and theirdependents, contractors, and o
ther individuals. In addition, the Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, and toprovide other services to 
the Utility or the Utility’s customers. In addition, the Utility is increasingly being required to disclose large amounts of data (includingcustomer energy usage a
nd personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California’s electricity market related to grid modernization andcustomer choice. These th
ird-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility’s systems and information, or experiencesecurity incidents or in
adequate security measures. Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility’s information technology systems could impact the Utility’s ability totrack or collect revenues an
d to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting.The Utility and its third-p
arty vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to theUtility’s information 
technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility’s operations. Noneof these breaches or at
tempts has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sfinancial condition, r
esults of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that theUtility will be able to pr
event unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations. Suchevents could subject the Uti
lity to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacylaws, investigations, and regul
atory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’sreputation, any of which could hav
e a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility maintains cyb
er liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance willcontinue to be availabl
e at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered byinsurance or recoverab
le in rates.52

The operation and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able tofully recover its costs i
f regulatory requirements or operating conditions change or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire.The operation of the 
Utility’s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such asrisks relating to opera
tion of the Diablo Canyon nuclear generation units as well as the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release ofradioactive materials caused by
 a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered byinsurance or exceed the 
amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,results of operations, liqu
idity, and cash flows. In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $275 million of liabilities arising out of eachnuclear incident occu
rring not only at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States.On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirem
ent of Diablo Canyon units by 2024 and 2025. However, the Utility continues to face public concern aboutthe safety of nuclear g
eneration and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging theactions of the NRC and urging government
al entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail,regulatory proceedings m
ay take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changesin legislation, regula
tions, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility’s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease beforetheir respective l
icenses expire in 2024 and 2025. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecoveredinvestment and such charge 
could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows.
In addition, in order to re
tain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incurcosts in connection with (i) 
an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, which program has been approved by the CPUC,and (ii) an employee r
etraining and development program, to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project andelsewhere in the Utility. Th
ere can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilled personnel under its employee programs.The Utility has incurred, and 
may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. (See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1.Business above.) If the Utility we
re unable to recover these costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected. The Utilitymay determine that 
it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRCmay order the Utility to 
cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions. The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceasesoperations at Diablo Canyon’s two nucl
ear generation units before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. At December 31, 2020, the Utility’sunrecovered investment 
in Diablo Canyon was $1.4 billion.The Utility also has an obliga
tion to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, atthe end of their useful l
ives. (See Note 3: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - “Asset Retirement Obligations” of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatement in Item 8.) Th
e CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioningcharges that are col
lected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit. If theUtility’s actual deco
mmissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.Diablo Canyon Unit 2 has experienced fou
r outages between July 2020 and February 24, 2021, each due or related to malfunctions within the main generatorassociated with excessive v
ibrations. If the Utility is unable to adequately address the vibration issues in the Unit 2 generator, it may be required to operate Unit 2at reduced operating l
evels or take the unit out of service for additional inspection, maintenance, or replacement of the affected component. Actions that may benecessary in response to the v
ibrations affecting the generator, or the occurrence or length of future outages, may result in incremental costs or forgone powermarket revenues. The Util
ity will also be subject to a review of the reasonableness of its actions before the CPUC. If additional outages occur in the future, or ifUnit 2’s planned spring 2021 refuel
ing outage is extended due to the inspections and replacement of the affected component, the Utility may incur additionalincremental costs or 
forgo additional power market revenues. Furthermore, the cost of such actions may exceed current estimates, such costs may not be fullyrecovered from insuran
ce through NEIL, or the costs may not be recovered through regulatory processes or otherwise. These amounts could be material and have amaterial effect on the Utility’s fi
nancial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.53

Risks Related to Environmental FactorsSevere weather conditions, extended drought and shifting cli
mate patterns could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
Extreme weather, droug
ht and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with wildfire management in California. The Utility’s serviceterritory encompasses so
me of the most densely forested areas in California and, as a consequence, is subject to higher risk from vegetation-related ignition eventsthan other California IOUs. Furthe
r, environmental extremes, such as drought conditions followed by periods of wet weather, can drive additional vegetationgrowth (which can then fuel fi
res) and influence both the likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events. In particular, the risk posed by wildfires hasincreased in the Utili
ty’s service area as a result of a prior extended period of drought, bark beetle infestations in the California forest and wildfire fuel increasesdue to rising temperatu
res and record rainfall following the drought, and strong wind events, among other environmental factors. Contributing factors other thanenvironmental can include l
ocal land use policies and historical forestry management practices. The combined effects of extreme weather and climate change alsoimpact this risk. According 
to CalFire, as of December 12, 2020, over 9,639 fires have burned 4,359,517 acres, more than four percent of the state’s roughly 100million acres of land, 
making 2020 the largest wildfire season recorded in California’s modern history. In January 2018, the CPUC approved a statewide fire-threatmap that shows that
 approximately half of the Utility’s service territory is facing “elevated” or “extreme” fire danger. Approximately 25,000 circuit miles of theUtility’s nearly 81,000 distr
ibution overhead circuit miles and approximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit miles are in such high-fire threat areas, significantly m
ore in total than other California IOUs.Severe weather events and oth
er natural disasters, including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, heat waves, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, risingsea levels, pandemics, sol
ar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters such as wildfires, could result in severe business disruptions, prolongedpower outages, property damage, 
injuries or loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to PG&E Corporationand the Utility. Any such event could h
ave a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows. Any of such events also could lead 
to significant claims against the Utility. Further, these events could result in regulatory penalties and disallowances,particularly if th
e Utility encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if the related losses are found to be the result of the Utility’spractices and/or the failure of
 electric and other equipment of the Utility.Further, the Utility 
has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on itsassets, operations, and servi
ces, as part of its CVA. Following completion of this assessment, the Utility is developing adaptation plans to set forth a strategy forthose events and co
nditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Scientists project that climate change will increase electricity demand due to moreextreme, persistent 
and hot weather. As a result, the Utility’s hydroelectric generation could change, and the Utility would need to consider managing or acquiringadditional generation. If t
he Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customerdemand, it may become mo
re costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, climate hazards such as heatwaves, wind storms, andflooding caused by rising sea l
evels and extreme storms could damage the Utility’s facilities, including gas, generation, and electric transmission and distributionassets. The Utility could incu
r substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages orinjuries. The Utility ant
icipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase.
Events or conditions caused by cl
imate change could have a greater impact on the Utility’s operations than the Utility’s studies suggest and could result in lowerrevenues or increased exp
enses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.54

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes in or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s financial results.
The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage,remediation of haza
rdous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and othercosts associated with compl
iance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required topay for environmental r
emediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although theUtility has recorded li
abilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination,remediation alternatives, the ap
plicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. (For more information, see Note 15 ofthe Notes to the Consolidated Financ
ial Statements in Item 8.)Environmental remedi
ation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and moreexpansive application of 
existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses orpermits issued by environmen
tal or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or othersanctions.
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to r
ecover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of thesemechanisms allows the Util
ity rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. TheCPUC may discontinue or change these ra
temaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC hasauthorized the Utility 
to recover in rates.Some of the Utility’s environ
mental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through ratesor insurance. (See “Environm
ental Regulation” in Item 1. and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) The Utility’s costs toremediate groundwater 
contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue tohave, a material effect on P
G&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results. Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimatedcosts and by the extent to which a
ctual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities.State climate policy r
equires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. Various proposals for addressing these reductions havethe potential to reduce natural gas usage and increase natural gas costs, which ma
y impact the future of natural gas services. The future recovery of theincreased costs associated with compl
iance is uncertain.The CARB is the state’s primary regu
lator for GHG emission reduction programs. Natural gas providers have been subject to compliance with CARB’s Cap-and-Trade Program since 2015, and natu
ral gas end-use customers have an increasing exposure to carbon costs under the Program through 2030 when the full cost willbe reflected in custo
mer bills. CARB’s Scoping Plan also proposes various methods of reducing GHG emissions from natural gas. These include more aggressiveenergy efficiency prog
rams to reduce natural gas end use, increased renewable portfolio standards generation in the electric sector reducing noncore gas load, andreplacement of natural gas ap
pliances with electric appliances, leading to further reduced demand. These natural gas load reductions may be partially offset byCARB’s proposals to deploy natural gas to rep
lace wood fuel in home heating and diesel in transportation applications. CARB also proposes a displacement ofsome conventional natura
l gas with above-market renewable natural gas. The combination of reduced load and increased costs could result in higher natural gascustomer bills and a poten
tial mandate to deliver renewable natural gas could lead to cost recovery risk. In addition, local city governments have passed ordinancesrestricting use of natu
ral gas in new construction, and if other jurisdictions follow suit, this could affect future demand for the provision of natural gas.55

General Risk FactorsThe Utility’s success depends on the availab
ility of the services of a qualified workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreementswhich cover a substantial number of employees. PG&E Corporation’s and the Uti
lity’s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attract and retain qualifiedpersonnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disrupt
ions occur.The Utility’s workforce is ag
ing, and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts torecruit and train new f
ield service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility’semployees are covered by 
collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renewthe terms of these agr
eements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-representedUtility employees could jo
in one of these unions in the future.PG&E Corporatio
n and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore thereputational harm gen
erated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings and the recent Chapter 11 Cases. Any such occurrencescould materially a
ffect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Utility owns or has obtained the 
right to occupy and/or use real property comprising the Utility’s electricity and natural gas distribution facilities, electricgeneration facilities, natural ga
s gathering facilities and generation facilities, and natural gas and electricity transmission facilities, which are described in Item 1.Business, under “Electric Uti
lity Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations.” The Utility occupies or uses real property primarily through various leases,easements, rights-of-way, p
ermits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental authorities. In total, the Utility occupies 11 million square feet of realproperty, including 9 mill
ion square feet owned by the Utility. The Utility’s corporate headquarters comprises approximately 1.7 million square feet located inseveral Utility-owned build
ings in San Francisco, California. The Utility intends to sell its current corporate headquarters office space generally located at 77 BealeStreet, 215 Market Street, 245 M
arket Street and 50 Main Street, San Francisco, California, and associated properties owned by the Utility, and on September 30,2020, the Utility filed an app
lication seeking the required CPUC approval. On October 23, 2020, the Utility entered into an office lease agreement with BA2 300Lakeside LLC for approximate
ly 910,000 rentable square feet of space within the building located at 300 Lakeside Drive, Oakland, California, 94612 (“LakesideBuilding”) to serve as the Uti
lity’s principal administrative headquarters. The term of the lease will begin on or about March 1, 2022 and will grant the Utility anoption to purchase the lega
l parcel that contains the Lakeside Building. For more information, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements inItem 8.
PG&E Corporation also leases approxi
mately 42,000 square feet of office space from a third party in San Francisco, California. This lease will expire in 2022.The Utility currently owns approx
imately 158,000 acres of land, including approximately 128,000 acres of watershed lands. In 2002, the Utility agreed toimplement its LCC to perman
ently preserve the six “beneficial public values” on all the watershed lands through conservation easements or equivalent protections,as well as to make approxim
ately 40,000 acres of the watershed lands available for donation to qualified organizations. The six “beneficial public values” beingpreserved by the LCC include: natu
ral habitat of fish, wildlife, and plants; open space; outdoor recreation by the general public; sustainable forestry; agriculturaluses; and historic values. The Ut
ility’s goal is to implement all the transactions needed to implement the LCC by the end of 2022, subject to securing all requiredregulatory approvals.

ITEM 7. MANAGE
MENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOVERVIEW
PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose pri
mary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and centralCalifornia.  The Utility gen
erates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.The Utility’s base revenue 
requirements are set by the CPUC in its GRC and GT&S rate case based on forecast costs. Differences between forecast costs and actualcosts can occur for numerous 
reasons, including the volume of work required and the impact of market forces on the cost of labor and materials. Differences incosts can also arise fro
m changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level. Generally, differences between actual costs and forecast costs affect theUtility’s ability to e
arn its authorized return (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings” in Results of Operations below). The Utility’s basetransmission revenue requ
irements are recovered through a formula rate approved by the FERC that trues up forecast and actual costs. For certain operating costs,such as costs associated with pens
ion benefits, the Utility is authorized to track the difference between actual amounts and forecast amounts and recover or refundthe difference through 
rates (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Results of Operations below). The Utility also collectsrevenue requirements 
to recover certain costs that the CPUC has authorized the Utility to pass on to customers, such as the costs to procure electricity or naturalgas for its customers. Ther
efore, although these costs can fluctuate, they generally do not impact net income (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did notImpact Earnings” in Results o
f Operations below). See “Ratemaking Mechanisms” in Item 1. Business for further discussion.This is a combined report of PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility, and includes separate Consolidated Financial Statements for each of these two entities. Thiscombined MD&A should be read in conjunc
tion with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included inItem 8.

Chapter 11 Proceedings and EmergenceOn the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. On the Effective Date,PG&E Corporation and the Utility em
erged from Chapter 11, pursuant to the Plan, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court in the Confirmation Order.However, certain parties h
ave filed notices of appeal with respect to the Confirmation Order, including provisions related to the injunction contained in the Planthat channels certain pre-petitio
n fire-related claims to trusts to be satisfied from the trusts’ assets.For more information about 
the Chapter 11 Cases, Chapter 11 emergence and the related transactions, see “Liquidity and Financial Resources” below and Notes 2,5 and 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Fin
ancial Statements in Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K.Tax Matters
As a result of the Plan, which includ
es wildfire settlement payments made in the third quarter of 2020, PG&E Corporation had a federal net operating losscarryforward of approxim
ately $28.5 billion and state net operating loss carryforward of $25.4 billion at the end of 2020.Under Section 382 of the Interna
l Revenue Code, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” net operating loss carryforwardsand other tax attribut
es may be subject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders(generally five per
cent shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentageownership during the testing per
iod (generally three years). PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Amended Articles limit Transfers (as defined in the AmendedArticles) that incr
ease a person’s or entity’s (including certain groups of persons) ownership of PG&E Corporation’s equity securities to more than 4.75% prior tothe Restriction Release Da
te without approval by the Board of Directors. As discussed below under “Update on Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’sAmended Articles,” the ca
lculation of the percentage ownership may differ depending on whether the Fire Victim Trust is treated as a qualified settlement trust orgrantor trust.
As of the date of this report, 
it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change, and consequently, its net operating losscarryforwards and other t
ax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.In 2019, $6.75 billion of the liabi
lity to be paid to the Fire Victim Trust in PG&E Corporation’s common stock was accrued by the Utility. Because thecorresponding tax deduction gen
erally occurs no earlier than payment, the Utility established a deferred tax asset for the accrual in 2019. On July 1, 2020, theUtility issued to the Fire Vic
tim Trust 477.0 million shares of PG&E Corporation’s common stock. On the date of transfer, the shares transferred to the Fire VictimTrust were valued at $4.53 bill
ion, $2.2 billion less than the $6.75 billion that had been accrued as a liability in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Therefore, in the quart
er ended June 30, 2020, the Utility recorded a charge of $619 million to adjust the measurement of the deferred tax asset to reflect the tax-effected differ
ence between the accrual of $6.75 billion and the tax deduction of $4.53 billion for the transfer of PG&E Corporation’s shares to the Fire VictimTrust.
In addition, the tax deduct
ion recorded reflects PG&E Corporation’s conclusion as of December 31, 2020 that it is more likely than not that the Fire Victim Trustwill be treated as a “qu
alified settlement fund” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case the corresponding tax deduction will have occurred at the timethe PG&E Corporation common stock was tr
ansferred to the Fire Victim Trust. In January 2021, PG&E Corporation received an IRS ruling that states the Utility iseligible to make a gr
antor trust election for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the Fire Victim Trust and addressed certain, but not all, related issues.As discussed further below under “Updat
e on Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles,” PG&E Corporation believes benefits associatedwith “grantor trust” tr
eatment could be realized, but only if PG&E Corporation and the Fire Victim Trust can meet certain requirements of the Internal RevenueCode and Treasury Regulations ther
eunder, relating to sales of PG&E Corporation common stock. PG&E Corporation expects to elect grantor trust treatment,subject to entering into 
a definitive agreement with the Fire Victim Trust. There can be no assurance that such an agreement will be reached or that PG&ECorporation will be able to av
ail itself of the benefits of a grantor trust election.61

At December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Financial Statements reflect “qualified settlement fund” treatment. If PG&E Corporation were to makea “grantor trust” el
ection for the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility’s tax deduction will occur instead at the time the Fire Victim Trust pays the fire victims and will beimpacted by the price 
at which the Fire Victim Trust sells the shares. The value of the deduction may be materially different than the value of the deduction if theFire Victim Trust were to be 
treated as a “qualified settlement fund.” Additionally, $5.4 billion of cash and $4.54 billion of PG&E Corporation common stock, inthe aggregate $10.0 billion 
that was transferred to the Fire Victim Trust in 2020 will not be deductible for tax purposes until the trust pays the fire victims.Consequently, PG&E Corporation’s net opera
ting loss will decrease by approximately $10.0 billion and result in a $1.3 billion charge, net of tax, decreasing netdeferred tax assets by $1.3 bi
llion on its Consolidated Financial Statements for activity through December 31, 2020. PG&E Corporation will subsequentlyrecognize income tax b
enefits and the corresponding deferred tax asset as the Fire Victim Trust sells the shares.Update on Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles
The Plan contemplates tha
t the Fire Victim Trust will be treated as a “qualified settlement fund” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to PG&ECorporation’s ability to e
lect to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a “grantor trust” for U.S. federal income tax purposes instead. Based on the facts known to date,PG&E Corporation believes benefi
ts associated with the “grantor trust” treatment could be realized for U.S. federal income tax purposes. (See “Tax Matters”above for more informa
tion.)If PG&E Corporation were to make a 
“grantor trust” election with respect to the Fire Victim Trust, then any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust wouldeffectively be exc
luded from the total number of outstanding equity securities when calculating a person’s percentage ownership for purposes of the 4.75 percentownership limitation in PG&E Corpora
tion's charter. For example, although PG&E Corporation had 1,984,683,820 shares outstanding as of February 22, 2021,only 1,506,940,230 shares (the number of outs
tanding shares of common stock less the number of shares held by the Fire Victim Trust) would count as outstandingfor purposes of the ownership rest
rictions in the Amended Articles. As of February 22, 2021, to the knowledge of PG&E Corporation, the Fire Victim Trust hadnot sold any shares of PG&E Corporation com
mon stock.Summary of Changes in Net Income and Earnings per Share
PG&E Corporation’s net loss attribu
table to common shareholders was $1.3 billion in 2020, compared to $7.7 billion in 2019. PG&E Corporation recognizedcharges of $56 million and $195 m
illion, net of probable insurance recoveries, for claims in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire and the 2019 Kincade fire,respectively, for the y
ear ended December 31, 2020, compared to charges of $11.4 billion for claims in connection with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires and 
the 2015 Butte fire for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, PG&E Corporation recognized $1.1 billion of expense related tothe Backstop Commitment Prem
ium Shares and $452 million of expense related to the Additional Backstop Premium Shares for the year ended December 31,2020, with no similar amounts in 2019.

Key Factors Affecting Financial ResultsPG&E Corporation and the Utility bel
ieve that their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the followingfactors:
•
The Uncertainties in Connection with Any Future Wildfires, Wildfire Insurance, and AB 1054. While PG&E Corporation and the Util ity cannot predict theoccurrence, timing or 
extent of damages in connection with future wildfires, factors such as environmental conditions (including weather and vegetationconditions) and the efficac
y of wildfire risk mitigation initiatives are expected to influence the frequency and severity of future wildfires. To the extentthat future wildfires o
ccur in the Utility’s service territory, the Utility may incur costs associated with the investigations of the causes and origins of suchfires, even if it is subsequ
ently determined that such fires were not caused by the Utility’s facilities. The financial impact of future wildfires could bemitigated through insuran
ce, the Wildfire Fund or other forms of cost recovery. However, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient wildfireinsurance coverage at 
a reasonable cost, and any such coverage may include limitations that could result in substantial uninsured losses depending on theamount and type of damages r
esulting from covered events. In July and August 2020, the Utility renewed its liability insurance coverage for wildfireevents in the aggregate 
amount of $867.5 million (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $60 million), comprised of $825 million for the period ofAugust 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021 and $42.5 million in reinsu
rance for the period of July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021. Various coverage limitationsapplicable to diffe
rent insurance layers could result in material uninsured costs in the future depending on the amount and type of damages resulting fromcovered events. The Utility wi
ll not be able to obtain any recovery from the Wildfire Fund for wildfire-related losses in any year that do not exceed thegreater of $1.0 billion in 
the aggregate and the amount of insurance coverage required under AB 1054. In addition, the policy reforms contemplated byAB 1054 are likely to affect 
the financial impact of future wildfires on PG&E Corporation and the Utility should any such wildfires occur. The WildfireFund is available to
 the Utility to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from future wildfires and serves as an alternative to traditional insuranceproducts, provided that the Uti
lity satisfies the conditions to the Utility’s ongoing participation in the Wildfire Fund set forth in AB 1054 and that theWildfire Fund has suffici
ent remaining funds. (See “Insurance Coverage” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)However, the impact of AB 1054 on PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility is subject to numerous uncertainties, including the Utility’s ability to demonstrateto the CPUC that wildfire-rela
ted costs paid from the Wildfire Fund were just and reasonable, and whether the benefits of participating in the WildfireFund ultimately outweigh its subst
antial costs. Finally, even if the Utility satisfies the ongoing eligibility and other requirements set forth in AB 1054, foreligible claims ag
ainst the Utility arising from wildfires that occurred between July 12, 2019 and the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11 on July 1, 2020,the availability of 
the Wildfire Fund to pay such claims would be capped at 40% of the amount of such claims. (See “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” inNote 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Fin
ancial Statements in Item 8.)63

•The Uncertainties Regarding the Impact of Public Safety Power Shutoffs. The Utility’s wildfire r isk mitigation initiatives involve substantial and ongoingexpenditures and could involve o
ther costs. The extent to which the Utility will be able to recover these expenditures and potential other costs throughrates is uncertain. The PSPS program, on
e of the Utility’s wildfire risk mitigation initiatives outlined in the 2019 WMP and included in the 2020-2022WMP, has been the subject of signi
ficant scrutiny and criticism by various stakeholders, including the California governor, the CPUC and the courtoverseeing the Utility’s p
robation. On November 12, 2019, the CPUC issued an order to show cause against the Utility related to implementation of theOctober 2019 PSPS events, and on November 13, 2019, the CPUC instituted an OII 
to examine California’s IOUs late 2019 PSPS events and to considerenforcement actions. 
In their comments submitted to the CPUC on October 16, 2020 in the OII to Examine the Late 2019 Public Safety Power ShutoffEvents, TURN, an intervenor in this proce
eding, proposed that the CPUC should treat each customer affected by a PSPS event, for which the IOU has notadequately demonstrat
ed that the benefits outweigh the public safety risks, as a separate offense. Under the CPUC rules, each offense would be subject toa penalty of no less than $500 and no mo
re than $100,000. On October 30, 2020, Cal Advocates, an intervenor in the Order to Show Cause Against theUtility Related to Impl
ementation of the October 2019 PSPS Events proposed financial penalties against the Utility of $166 million. If adopted by theCPUC, such penalties could be expected to h
ave a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows. The PSPS program has had 
an adverse impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reputation with customers, regulatorsand policymakers and futur
e PSPS events may increase these negative perceptions. In addition to the 2019 PSPS events, the Utility initiated several PSPSevents in the third and four
th quarters of 2020 and one in January 2021 and expects that additional PSPS events will be necessary in future years. (See“OII to Examine the Late 2019 Publ
ic Safety Power Shutoff Events” and “OIR to Examine Electric Utility De-energization of Power Lines in DangerousConditions” in “Regulatory Matt
ers” below.)•
The Costs and Execution of Other Wildfire Mitigation Efforts. In response to the wildfire threat facing California, PG&E Corporation and the Utility havetaken aggressive steps to m
itigate the threat of catastrophic wildfires, the spread of wildfires should they occur and the impact of PSPS events. PG&ECorporation and the Utility in
curred approximately $2.6 billion in connection with the 2019 WMP and incurred approximately $2.9 billion in 2020 inconnection with the 2020-2022 WMP. Although the Ut
ility may seek cost recovery for certain of these expenses and capital expenditures, the Utility hasagreed in the Wildfires OII
 not to seek rate recovery of certain wildfire-related expenses and capital expenditures that it has incurred or will incur in theamount of $1.823 billion in futur
e applications.While PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity are committed to taking aggressive wildfire mitigation actions, if additional requirements are imposed that gobeyond current expectat
ions, such requirements could have a substantial impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity and c
ash flows. For example, the Court overseeing the Utility’s probation in connection with the Utility’s federal criminal proceedinghas imposed numerous obligations on 
the Utility related to its business and operations. The success of the Utility’s wildfire mitigation efforts depends onmany factors, including on wheth
er the Utility is able to retain or contract for the workforce necessary to execute its wildfire mitigation actions. (See“U.S. District Court Matters and Proba
tion” and “2020 General Rate Case” below and “Order Instituting Investigation into the 2017 Northern CaliforniaWildfires and the 2018 Camp Fir
e” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)•
The Timing and Outcome of Ratemaking Proceedings. The Utility’s financia l results may be impacted by the timing and outcome of its FERC TO18 andTO19 rate cases, WMCE applicat
ion, and its ability to timely recover costs not currently in rates, including costs already incurred and future costs trackedin its CEMA, WEMA, WMPMA, FRMMA, CPPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and RTB
A. The outcome of regulatory proceedings can be affected by manyfactors, including interve
ning parties’ testimonies, potential rate impacts, the Utility’s reputation, the regulatory and political environments, and otherfactors. The Utility’s ab
ility to seek cost recovery will also be limited as a result of the outcome of the Wildfires OII. (See Notes 4 and 15 of the Notes tothe Consolidated Financial Sta
tements in Item 8 and “Regulatory Matters” below.)64

•The Impact of the 2019 Kincade Fire. Claims related to the 2019 Kin cade fire that were not satisfied in full as of the Effective Date were not discharged inconnection with emerging f
rom Chapter 11. On July 16, 2020, Cal Fire issued a press release stating that it had determined that “the Kincade fire wascaused by electrica
l transmission lines owned and operated by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E).” Accordingly, if PG&E Corporation or the Utility weredetermined to be liab
le for the 2019 Kincade fire, such liabilities could be significant and could exceed or be excluded from the amounts available underapplicable insurance po
licies or the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054, which could have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity and cash flows. As of December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had recorded a loss of$625 million for the 2019 Kincade 
fire (before available insurance), which amount corresponds to the lower end of the range of reasonably estimableprobable losses, but does not includ
e all categories of potential damages. If the liability for the 2019 Kincade fire were to exceed $1.0 billion, it is possiblethe Utility would be eligibl
e to make a claim to the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 for such excess amount, subject to a 40% cap on the amount of suchclaim. As of December 31, 2020, the Ut
ility had also recorded an insurance receivable for $430 million. (See “2019 Kincade Fire” in Note 14 of the Notesto the Consolidated Financial St
atements in Item 8 for more information.)•
The Impact of the 2020 Zogg Fire. There have been numerous wildf ires in the Utility’s service territory during the 2020 wildfire season. If the Utilitywere alleged or deter
mined to be a cause of one or more of these wildfires, this allegation or determination could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. On October 9, 2020 Cal Fire informed the Utility that ithad taken possession of Utility equ
ipment as part of Cal Fire’s ongoing investigation into the 2020 Zogg fire. The investigation is preliminary and CalFire has not issued a determ
ination of cause, but if PG&E Corporation or the Utility were determined to be liable for the 2020 Zogg fire, such liabilitiescould be significant and cou
ld exceed or be excluded from the amounts available under applicable insurance policies or the Wildfire Fund under AB1054, which could be expected to have 
a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity andcash flows. As of December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility had recorded a loss of $275 million for the 2020 Zogg fire (before availableinsurance), which amount cor
responds to the lower end of the range of reasonably estimable probable losses, but does not include all categories ofpotential damages. As of Dece
mber 31, 2020, the Utility had also recorded an insurance receivable for $219 million in connection with the 2020 Zoggfire. (For more inform
ation see “2020 Zogg Fire” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)•
The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows havebeen and could continue to be sign
ificantly affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. The principal areas of near-term impact include liquidity, financialresults and business operations, s
temming primarily from the ongoing economic hardship of the Utility’s customers, the moratorium on servicedisconnections for residen
tial and small business customers, the CPUC’s “Emergency Authorization and Order Directing Utilities to ImplementEmergency Customer COVID-19 Protections” 
and an observed reduction in non-residential electrical load. The Utility continues to monitor the overallimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic; howev
er, the Utility expects a significant impact on monthly cash collections as long as current circumstances persist.This impact to liquidity 
may be partially offset by reductions in discretionary spending or potential regulatory impacts. As of December 31, 2020, PG&ECorporation and the Utility had 
access to approximately $2.8 billion of total liquidity comprised of approximately $261 million of Utility cash, $223million of PG&E Corporation cash and $2.4 b
illion of availability under the Utility and PG&E Corporation credit facilities. Other potential impacts ofCOVID-19 on PG&E Corporation and the Utility include op
erational disruptions, workforce disruptions, both in personnel availability (including areduction in contract 
labor resources) and deployment, delays in production and shipping of materials used in the Utility’s operations, a reduction inrevenue due to the cost of c
apital adjustment mechanism, the potential for higher credit spreads and borrowing costs and incremental financing needs. Asdiscussed below under the heading “COVID-19 Pandem
ic Protections Memorandum Account,” the Utility has established a memorandum account fortracking costs relat
ed to the CPUC’s emergency authorization and order, which, as of December 31, 2020, was $84 million. The Utility intends to seekrecovery of this balanc
e in a future application, subject to CPUC reasonableness review. For more information on the impact of COVID-19 on PG&ECorporation and the Utility, se
e “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows have been andcould continue to be signifi
cantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic” in Item 1A Risk Factors in Part I.PG&E Corporation and the Utility expe
ct additional financial impacts in the future as a result of COVID-19. PG&E Corporation and the Utility continueto evaluate the overa
ll impact of COVID-19 and their analysis is subject to change.65

•The Outcome of Other Enforcement, Litigation, and Regulatory Matters, and Other Government Proposals. The Utility’s financia l results may continue tobe impacted by the outcom
e of other current and future enforcement, litigation, and regulatory matters, including those described above as well as theoutcome of the Safety Cultur
e OII, the sentencing terms of the Utility’s January 27, 2017 federal criminal conviction, including the oversight of theUtility’s probation and the po
tential recommendations by the Monitor, and potential penalties in connection with the Utility’s safety and other self-reports. (See Note 15 of the Notes to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) In addition, the Utility’s business profile and financial resultscould be impacted by the out
come of recent calls for municipalization of part or all of the Utility’s businesses, offers by municipalities and other publicentities to acquire the electric as
sets of the Utility within their respective jurisdictions and calls for state intervention, including the possibility of a statetakeover of the Utility. PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility cannot predict the nature, occurrence, timing or extent of any such scenario, and there can be noassurance that any such scen
ario would not involve significant ownership or management changes to PG&E Corporation or the Utility, including by thestate of California. Furth
er, certain parties filed notices of appeal with respect to the Confirmation Order, including provisions related to the injunctioncontained in the Plan
 that channels certain pre-petition fire-related claims to trusts to be satisfied from the trusts’ assets. There can be no assurance thatany such appeal will not be succ
essful and, if successful, that any such appeal would not have a material adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and theUtility.
•
The Uncertainties in Connection with a Potential Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process. On November 24, 2020, the Utility rece ived a letter (the“Letter”) from th
e President of the CPUC, related to the Utility’s vegetation and asset management activities and the CPUC’s Enhanced Oversight andEnforcement Process. If th
e Utility is placed into the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process, it will be subject to additional reportingrequirements, monitor
ing, and oversight by the CPUC.For more information about 
the risks that could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows, or that could cause futu
re results to differ from historical results, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this 2020 Form 10-K.  In addition, this annual reportcontains forward-looking sta
tements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  These statements reflect management’s judgment and opinionsthat are based on curren
t estimates, expectations, and projections about future events and assumptions regarding these events and management’s knowledge offacts as of the date of 
this report.  See the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” above for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual results todiffer materia
lly.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict all the factors that may affect future results and do not undertake an obligation to updateforward-looking statemen
ts, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings
The following discussion presents th
e Utility’s operating results for 2020, 2019, and 2018, focusing on revenues and expenses that impacted earnings for theseperiods.
Operating Revenues
The Utility’s electr
ic and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $546 million, or 5%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due toincreased base revenues 
authorized in the 2020 GRC and 2019 GT&S rate cases, additional revenues recorded pursuant to the TO20 rate case, and CEMA interimrate relief.
The Utility’s electr
ic and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $988 million, or 9%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due toincreased revenues autho
rized in the 2017 GRC and 2019 GT&S rate cases, and revenues recorded pursuant to the TO20 rate case.(1)(1)

67

Operating and MaintenanceThe Utility’s operating and 
maintenance expenses that impacted earnings decreased $768 million, or 11%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a reductionin accelerated t
ransmission inspection and repair costs of approximately $460 million. Additionally, in 2019 the Utility recorded $398 million related to theWildfires OII settl
ement and $237 million in disallowed costs for previously incurred capital expenditures in excess of adopted amounts in the 2019 GT&S ratecase in 2019, with no similar ch
arges in 2020. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $223 million in previously deferred CEMA costs recorded inconjunction with interim 
rate relief (see “2018 CEMA Application” below) (the Utility amortized $298 million in deferred CEMA costs in 2020, compared to$75 million amortized 
in 2019). The Utility also experienced increased insurance premium costs in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019.The Utility’s operating and 
maintenance expenses that impacted earnings increased $1,692 million, or 31%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to$773 million in costs rela
ted to enhanced and accelerated inspections and repairs of transmission and distribution assets, with no similar charges in the same periodin 2018. Additionally, the Utility 
recorded $398 million in 2019 related to the Wildfires OII settlement, with no similar charge in the same period in 2018. Also, theUtility recorded $237 mil
lion in disallowed costs for previously incurred capital expenditures in excess of adopted amounts in the 2019 GT&S rate case, with nosimilar charges in 2018.

ims, net of insurance recoveriesCosts related to wildfires 
that impacted earnings decreased by $11.2 billion, or 98%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The Utility recognized pre-tax charges of$625 million related to 
the 2019 Kincade fire, partially offset by $430 million of probable insurance recoveries, and pre-tax charges of $275 million related to the2020 Zogg fire, partially of
fset by $219 million of probable insurance recoveries in 2020. The Utility recognized charges of $11.4 billion in 2019, for wildfire-related claims pr
imarily associated with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.Costs related to wildfires

ely, for wildfire-related claims, net of probable insurance recoveries, primarily associated with the 2018 Camp fire and2017 Northern California wildfi
res.(See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 14 of th
e Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)Wildfire fund expense
Wildfire fund expense th

 as a result recorded amortization and accretion expense related to the Wildfire Fund coverage received from the effective date of AB 1054through December 31, 2020.
(See Notes 3 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolid
ated Financial Statements in Item 8.)Depreciation, Amortization, and Decommissioning
The Utility’s deprecia
tion, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased by $236 million, or 7%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to capitaladditions and an increase 
in depreciation rates associated with the TO20 decision.The Utility’s deprecia
tion, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased by $197 million, or 6%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to capitaladditions.
Interest Income
The Utility’s interest 
income that impacted earnings decreased by $43 million, or 52%, in 2020 compared to 2019. Interest income decreased by $8 million, or11%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The Utili
ty’s interest income is primarily affected by changes in regulatory balancing accounts and changes in interest rates.Interest Expense
Interest expense that 
impacted earnings increased by $199 million, or 22%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the issuance of new debt in 2020 inconnection with the emerg
ence from Chapter 11.68

The Utility’s interest expense decreased by $2 million, or 0%, in 2019 compared to 2018. Beginning January 29, 2019 in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, theUtility ceased record
ing interest on outstanding pre-petition debt subject to compromise. In the fourth quarter of 2019, following the Bankruptcy Court’s December30, 2019 memorandum decision in which 
it ruled that the holders of allowed unsecured claims are entitled to post-petition interest at the federal judgment rate of2.59%, and pursuant to the terms o
f the Noteholder RSA, the Utility concluded that interest was probable of being an allowed claim and resumed recording intereston pre-petition debt subje
ct to compromise.Other Income, Net
Other income, net incre
ased by $231 million, or 367%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower pension expense resulting from higher than expectedreturn on plan assets.
The Utility’s other incom

t increased by $320 million, or 100%, in 2019 compared to 2018, due to $370 million of expenses directly associated with the Utility’sChapter 11 filing, partia
lly offset by interest income of $50 million, with no corresponding charges in 2018.Income Tax Provision (Benefit)
Income tax provision incr
eased by $3.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a pre-tax loss in 2019 compared to pre-tax income in 2020.Additionally, there 
was a $619 million adjustment from the measurement of the deferred tax asset associated with the difference between the liability recordedrelated to the TCC RSA and the ultima
te value of PG&E Corporation stock contributed to the Fire Victim Trust in 2020.The Utility’s income tax b
enefit increased $112 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher pre-tax losses. The following table reconc

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RES
OURCESOverview
As a result of PG&E Corporation’s and the Ut
ility’s emergence from Chapter 11 on July 1, 2020, substantial doubt has been alleviated regarding the Company’sability to meet its ob
ligations as they become due within one year after the date the financial statements were issued.As of and subsequent to the Effect
ive Date, the Utility’s ability to fund operations, finance capital expenditures, make scheduled principal and interest payments,and make distributions to PG&E Corpora
tion depends on the levels of its operating cash flows and access to the capital and credit markets. The CPUC authorizesthe Utility’s capita
l structure, the aggregate amount of long-term and short-term debt that the Utility may issue, and the revenue requirements the Utility is able tocollect to recover 
its cost of capital. The Utility generally utilizes retained earnings, equity contributions from PG&E Corporation and long-term debt issuances tomaintain its CPUC-authorized long
-term capital structure consisting of 52% equity and 48% debt and preferred stock and relies on short-term debt, including itsrevolving credit fac
ilities, to fund temporary financing needs. On May 28, 2020, the CPUC approved a final decision in the Chapter 11 Proceedings OII, which,among other things, grants the Ut
ility a temporary, five-year waiver from compliance with its authorized capital structure for the financing in place upon theUtility’s emergence 
from Chapter 11.70

PG&E Corporation’s ability to fund operations, make scheduled principal and interest payments, and fund equity contributions to the Utility depends on the levelof cash on hand, cash distributions 
received from the Utility, and PG&E Corporation’s access to the capital and credit markets.In 2019, as a result of the ini
tiation of the Chapter 11 Cases, each of Moody’s, Fitch, and S&P withdrew its credit ratings for PG&E Corporation and the Utility. Asa result of PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s credit ratings ceasing to be rated at investment grade, the Utility was required to post collateral under certain of itscommodity purchase agre
ements and certain other obligations. On June 15, 2020, Moody’s, Fitch, and S&P recommenced rating the Utility and PG&ECorporation.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
credit ratings may be affected by the ultimate outcome of pending enforcement and litigation matters. Credit ratingdowngrades may increase the 
cost and availability of short-term borrowing, including credit facilities and long-term debt costs. In addition, some of the Utility’scommodity contracts contain
 collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies.As a result of the outbreak of COVID-19, PG&E Corporat
ion’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could continueto be significantly af
fected. The Utility continues to evaluate the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the Utility expects a significant impact onmonthly cash collections 
as long as current circumstances persist, including the moratorium on service disconnections for residential and small business customersand an observed reduction in non-
residential electrical load. The Utility’s customer energy accounts receivable balances over 30 days outstanding as of December31, 2020, were approximately $825 mi
llion, or $478 million higher as compared to the balances as of December 31, 2019. The Utility is unable to estimate theportion of the increase d
irectly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Utility expects to continue experiencing an impact on monthly cash collections in2021 and for as long as current COVID-19 cir
cumstances persist. The reduction in cash collections from customers may be partially offset by reductions indiscretionary spending or pot
ential regulatory impacts.The outbreak of COVID-19 and the resulting 
economic conditions and government orders have had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on theUtility’s customers and, as 
a result, these circumstances have and will continue to impact the Utility for an indeterminate period of time. Although the Utility isseeking regulatory rel
ief to mitigate the impact of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that any relief is forthcoming or that, ifany relief measures 
are implemented, the timing that any such relief would impact the Utility. On April 16, 2020, the CPUC approved a resolution that authorizesutilities to establ
ish memorandum accounts to track incremental costs associated with complying with the customer protections described within the resolution. OnMay 1, 2020, the Utility filed an 
advice letter with the CPUC, describing all reasonable and necessary actions to implement emergency customer protectionsthrough April 16, 2021, which was subsequently updated on Jun
e 2, 2020, and July 15, 2020, to modify and clarify the filing based on CPUC guidance. On July 27,2020, the CPUC approved the Utility’s advice 
letter. (See “Emergency Authorization and Order Directing Utilities to Implement Emergency Customer COVID-19Protections” below for more 
information.)Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents consist o
f cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, with original maturities of three months or less. PG&E Corporation and theUtility maintain sepa
rate bank accounts and primarily invest their cash in money market funds. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Utility holds restrictedcash that primarily 
consists of cash held in escrow to be used to pay bankruptcy related professional fees.Financial Resources
DIP Credit Agreement
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cas
es, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into the DIP Credit Agreement, which received final approval from theBankruptcy Court on March 27, 2019.

On July 23, 2020, PG&E Corporation sent a notice of t
ermination to the managers of the Amended and Restated Equity Distribution Agreement, dated as ofFebruary 17, 2017, effectively 
terminating the agreement on that date. As of the termination date for this agreement, there were no issuances under this agreement.71

the “Common Stock Offering”), (ii) 342.1 million shares of common stock to the PIPE Investors pursuant to the InvestmentAgreement, (iii) prep
aid forward contracts between PG&E Corporation and the Backstop Parties dated as of June 19, 2020 (the “Forward Stock PurchaseAgreements”) and (iv) 14.5 m
illion of its equity units (the “Equity Units” and such offering the “Equity Unit Offering”).In August 2020, PG&E Corporation issued (i) 1.45 mil
lion Equity Units to the Equity Units Underwriters upon their exercise of their over-allotment option topurchase up to 1.45 million addi
tional Equity Units (such issuance, the “Additional Units Issuance”) and (ii) 42.3 million shares to the Backstop Parties pursuant tothe Forward Stock Purchase Agreements 
(with the balance of the Forward Stock Purchase Agreements being redeemed with the cash proceeds of these additionalEquity Units).
The prepaid forward stock purch
ase contract portion of the Equity Units issued in July and August 2020 represents the right of the unitholders to receive, on thesettlement date, be
tween 125 million and 153 million shares, and between 12.5 million and 15.3 million shares, respectively, of PG&E Corporation common stock,based on the value of PG&E Corporation co
mmon stock. The common stock received will be based on the value of PG&E Corporation common stock over ameasurement period specified i
n the purchase contracts and subject to certain adjustments as provided therein. The settlement date of the purchase contracts isAugust 16, 2023, subject to acceler
ation or postponement as provided in the purchase contracts. Such gross proceeds were used to fund distributions under thePlan.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, PG&E Corpor
ation made equity contributions to the Utility of $12.9 billion in cash and 478 million shares of PG&ECorporation common stock. Such shares we
re transferred to the Fire Victim Trust.Debt Financings

“Credit Facilities” in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Receivables Securitiza
tion ProgramOn October 5, 2020, the Utility, in its ind
ividual capacity and in its capacity as initial servicer, entered into an accounts receivable securitization program (the“Receivables Securiti
zation Program”), providing for the sale of a portion of the Utility’s accounts receivable to the SPV, a limited liability company whollyowned by the Utility. Pursuant to the Rec
eivables Securitization Program, the Utility sells certain of its receivables and certain related rights to payment andobligations of the Utility wi
th respect to such receivables and certain other related rights to the SPV, which, in turn, obtains loans secured by the receivables fromfinancial institut
ions (the “Lenders”). The Utility has pledged to the Lenders 100% of the equity interests in the SPV as security for the repayment of the loans. Theaggregate principal 
amount of the loans made by the Lenders cannot exceed $1 billion outstanding at any time.The loans under the Receivabl
es Securitization Program bear interest based on a spread over LIBOR dependent on the tranche period thereto and any breakage feesaccrued. The receivab
les financing agreement contains customary LIBOR benchmark replacement language giving the administrative agent, with consent from theSPV as to the successor rate, the r
ight to determine such successor rate. The Receivables Securitization Program contains certain customary representations andwarranties and affir
mative and negative covenants, including as to the eligibility of the receivables being sold by the Utility and securing the loans made by theLenders, as well as
 customary reserve requirements, Receivables Securitization Program termination events, and servicer defaults. The Receivables SecuritizationProgram termination ev
ents permit the Lenders to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including failure by the SPV to payamounts when due, certain def
aults on indebtedness under the Utility’s credit facility, certain judgments, a change of control, certain events negatively affecting theoverall credit qual
ity of transferred receivables and bankruptcy and insolvency events.The Receivables Securiti
zation Program is scheduled to terminate on October 5, 2022, unless extended or earlier terminated, at which time no further advances willbe available and the obl
igations thereunder must be repaid in full no later than (i) the date that is 180 days following such date or (ii) such earlier date on which theloans under the program beco
me due and payable.In general, the proceeds 
from the sale of the accounts receivable are used by the SPV to pay the purchase price for accounts receivables it acquires from the Utilityand may be used to fund capita
l expenditures, repay borrowings on the Utility Revolving Credit Facility, satisfy maturing debt obligations, as well as fund workingcapital needs and other 
approved uses.Although the SPV is a wholly owned consolidated subsidia
ry of the Utility, the SPV is legally separate from the Utility. The assets of the SPV (including theaccounts receivable
) are not available to creditors of the Utility or PG&E Corporation, and the accounts receivables are not legally assets of the Utility or PG&ECorporation. The Receivables Secu
ritization Program is accounted for as a secured financing. The pledged receivables and the corresponding debt are included inAccounts receivable and Long-
term debt, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.74

DividendsOn December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directo
rs of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s common stock, beginn
ing the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018.On April 3, 2019, the court overseeing th
e Utility’s probation issued an order imposing new conditions of probation, including forgoing issuing “any dividendsuntil [the Utility] is in
 compliance with all applicable vegetation management requirements” under applicable law and the Utility’s WMP.On March 20, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed a Case Resolution Contingency Process Motion with the Bankruptcy Court that includes a dividendrestriction for PG&E Corporat
ion. According to the dividend restriction, PG&E Corporation “will not pay common dividends until it has recognized $6.2 billion innon-GAAP core earnings following the Effe
ctive Date” of the Plan. The Bankruptcy Court entered the order approving the motion on April 9, 2020.In addition, the Corporation Revolv
ing Credit Agreement requires that PG&E Corporation (1) maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidatedcapitalization of no g
reater than 70% as of the end of each fiscal quarter and (2) if revolving loans are outstanding as of the end of a fiscal quarter, a ratio ofadjusted cash to fixed cha
rges, as of the end of such fiscal quarter, of at least 150% prior to the date that PG&E Corporation first declares a cash dividend on itscommon stock and at least 100
% thereafter.Under the Utility’s Articl
es of Incorporation, the Utility cannot pay common stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility’s preferredstock have been paid. Additional
ly, the CPUC requires the Utility to maintain a capital structure composed of at least 52% equity on average. On May 28, 2020,the CPUC approved a final decision in th
e Chapter 11 Proceedings OII, which, among other things, grants the Utility a temporary, five-year waiver fromcompliance with its autho
rized capital structure for the financing in place upon the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11.Subject to the foregoing res
trictions, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Boards of Directors and willdepend on, among other things, resul
ts of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Boards of Directorsmay deem relevant. As of Dec
ember 31, 2020, it is uncertain as to when PG&E Corporation and the Utility will commence the payment of dividends on theircommon stock and when the Utility wi
ll commence the payment of dividends on its preferred stock.Utility Cash Flows
The Utility’s cash flows were as 
follows:Year Ended December 31,
 (in millions)
2020 2019 2018 Net cash provided by (used in) oper
ating activities$ (19,047) $ 4,810 $ 4,704 Net cash used in investing act
ivities(7,748) (6,378) (6,564) Net cash provided by financing a
ctivities26,070 1,395 2,708 Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash
$ (725) $ (173) $ 848  Operating Activities
The Utility’s cash flows from op
erating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such asdepreciation that do not 
require the use of cash. During 2020, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $23.9 billion compared to 2019. This decreasewas primarily due to the pay
ment of $18.8 billion in satisfaction of pre-petition wildfire-related claims (including claims associated with the 2018 Camp fire, the2017 Northern California wildfi
res, and the 2015 Butte fire), and the initial, first and second annual contributions made to the Wildfire Fund of $5.2 billion, withno similar payments mad
e in 2019.75

During 2019, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $106 million compared to 2018. This increase was due to a decrease in interest paid from $773million to $7 million as 
a result of the automatic stay as of the Petition Date. Additionally, income taxes paid decreased from $59 million in 2018 to zero in 2019.These decreases in amounts p
aid were offset by an increase in amounts paid for reorganization items, and enhanced and accelerated inspections and repairs oftransmission and distribut
ion assets in 2019, with no similar payments in 2018, partially offset by additional amounts not paid due to the automatic stay as of thePetition Date.
Future cash flow from operat
ing activities will be affected by various factors, including:•
the timing and amount of costs in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire;•
the timing and amount of costs in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire;•
the timing and amounts of costs, including fines and penalties, that may be incurred in connection with current and future enforcement, litigation, andregulatory matters 
(see “Enforcement Matters” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and “Regulatory Matters”below for more informat
ion);•
the severity, extent and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Utility’s service territory, the ability of the Utility to collect onits customer invoices, th
e ability of the Utility’s customers to pay their utility bills in full and in a timely manner, the ability of the Utility to offset theseeffects, including with spend
ing reductions and the ability of the Utility to recover from customers any losses incurred in connection with COVID-19, aswell as the impact of COVID-19 on the av
ailability or cost of financing;•
the timing and amounts of annual contributions to the Wildfire Fund and if necessary, the availability of funds to pay eligible claims for liabilities arisingfrom future wildfires;
•
the timing and amount of substantially increasing costs in connection with the 2019 and 2020-2022 WMPs that are not currently being recovered in rates(see “Regulatory Matters” 
below for more information);•
the timing and amount of premium payments related to wildfire insurance (see “Insurance Coverage” in Note 14 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in Item
 8 for more information);•
the timing of and amount of the gain to be returned to customers from the sale of the SFGO; and•
the timing and outcomes of the FERC TO18 and TO19 rate cases, 2018 and 2019 CEMA applications, WEMA application, WMCE application, futureapplications for cost r
ecovery of amounts recorded to the FRMMA, CPPMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA and RTBA, future cost of capital proceedingsand other ratemaking and 
regulatory proceedings.Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing act
ivities increased by $1.4 billion during 2020 as compared to 2019 partially due to the payment of pre-petition vendor payables forcapital expenditures 
as a result of emerging from Chapter 11. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $186 million during 2019 as compared to 2018primarily due to a dec
rease in cash paid for capital expenditures as a result of the automatic stay as of the Petition Date. The Utility’s investing activities primarilyconsist of the construction o
f new and replacement facilities necessary to provide safe and reliable electricity and natural gas services to its customers.  Cash usedin investing activiti
es also includes the proceeds from sales of nuclear decommissioning trust investments which are largely offset by the amount of cash used topurchase new nuclear decom
missioning trust investments.  The funds in the decommissioning trusts, along with accumulated earnings, are used exclusively fordecommissioning and 
dismantling the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.Future cash flows used in investing a
ctivities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incurbetween $7.5 billion and $8.3 billion 
in capital expenditures in 2021. Additionally, future cash flows from investing activities will be impacted by the timing of andamount received from 
the proposed sale of the Utility’s SFGO.76

Financing ActivitiesDuring 2020, net cash provided by financ
ing activities increased by $24.7 billion as compared to 2019. This increase was primarily due to PG&E Corporationmaking a cash equity contr
ibution to the Utility of approximately $13.0 billion, and due to the Utility receiving $10.4 billion in proceeds from the issuance ofshort-term and long-te
rm first mortgage bonds, with no similar activity in 2019. Additionally, the Utility had net borrowings of $4.6 billion under its creditfacilities during th
e year ended December 31, 2020, with no similar activity in 2019 due to the Utility entering into the facilities in 2020. These increases werepartially offset by ne
t repayments of $1.5 billion on the DIP facilities in 2020, as compared to net borrowings of $1.5 billion on the DIP facilities in 2019.During 2019, net cash provided by financ
ing activities decreased by $1.3 billion as compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily due to $2.9 billion of netborrowings under revolving credi
t facilities in 2018, partially offset by $1.5 billion of net borrowings under the DIP initial term loan facility in 2019.Cash provided by or used in financing a
ctivities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by or used in operatingactivities, the lev
el of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date of existing debt instruments. CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS

inancial Statements in Item 8.) See “Purchase Commitments” and “Other Commitments” 
in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statemen
ts in Item 8. Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annual contribution requirements. As theseannual requirements continue indefinitely into the future, the amoun
t shown in the column entitled “more than 5 years” represents only 1 year of contributions for the Utility’s pension andother benefit plans.
 Beginning with the three-month period ending January 31, 2018, quarterly cash dividends on the Utili
ty’s preferred stock were suspended.  While the timing of cumulative dividend paymentsis uncertain, it is assumed for the table above to be payable within a fixed period of five years based on historical performance.  (See Note 7 of the Notes to the Conso
lidated FinancialStatements in Item 8.)
The contractual comm
itments table above excludes potential payments associated with unrecognized tax positions.  Due to the uncertainty surrounding tax audits,PG&E Corporation and the Utility canno
t make reliable estimates of the amounts and periods of future payments to major tax jurisdictions related to unrecognizedtax benefits.  Matters 
relating to tax years that remain subject to examination are discussed in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8.

Except as otherwise set forth in the Plan and the Confirmation Order, all executory contracts and unexpired leases were assumed by PG&E Corporation or theUtility, as applicable, on 
the Effective Date. Accordingly, any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease with PG&E Corporation or the Utility in thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K, including where appl
icable a quantification of the obligations under any such executory contract or unexpired lease, is qualified byany overriding assumption or r
ejection rights PG&E Corporation or the Utility, as applicable, has under the Bankruptcy Code, the Plan, and the ConfirmationOrder. Further, nothing herein is o
r shall be deemed to be an admission with respect to any claim amounts or calculations arising from the rejection of anyexecutory contract or un
expired lease and PG&E Corporation and the Utility expressly reserve all of their rights with respect thereto.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not hav
e any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future materialeffect on their fin
ancial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources,other than those discussed under 
“Purchase Commitments” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.ENFORCEMENT AND LITIGATI
ON MATTERSPG&E Corporation and the Utility have s
ignificant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to the enforcement and litigationmatters described in Not
es 14 and 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. that are incorporated by reference herein. The outcome ofthese matters, individu
ally or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows.
U.S. District Court Matters and Probation
On August 9, 2016, the jury in the federal 
criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in SanFrancisco, found the Utility gui
lty on one count of obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity managementregulations of the Natura
l Gas Pipeline Safety Act. On January 26, 2017, the court imposed a sentence on the Utility in connection with the conviction. The courtsentenced the Utility to 
a five-year corporate probation period, oversight by the Monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early terminationafter three years, a fine of 
$3 million to be paid to the federal government, certain advertising requirements, and community service.The probation includes a requ
irement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the probation, the Utilityhas retained the Monitor 
at the Utility’s expense. The goal of the Monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriate steps to maintain thesafety of its gas and
 electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive programs on a Utility-wide basis.On August 7, 2020, after a number of fil
ings involving different parties, the court entered an order adopting the new conditions jointly proposed by the Utility, theMonitor, and the Department o
f Justice on June 24, 2020. Among other things, these conditions require the Utility to staff an in-house vegetation inspectionmanager and approximat
ely 30 additional field inspectors to oversee vegetation management work. Further, the Utility is required to implement a program toassess the age and e
xpected useful life of certain electrical components in high fire-threat areas, incorporate this information into its risk-based asset managementprograms, and provide monthly prog
ress reports to the Monitor. The Utility must also hire additional inspectors to oversee inspections of its transmission assetsand implement a 90-day r
eplacement requirement for cold end hardware in high fire-threat areas with an observed material loss approaching 50%.On December 29, 2020, the court ente
red an order requiring the Utility to show cause as to why additional proposed conditions of probation should not be added.The proposed conditions would require 
the Utility to, when determining which distribution lines to de-energize during a PSPS event: (i) take into account theextent to which vegetation bo
rdering those lines is not in compliance with certain requirements, and (ii) to the extent that information shows that such vegetationpresents a safety haza
rd in the event of a windstorm, make a specific determination with respect to that distribution line and de-energize it unless the Utility findsin writing that there a
re specific reasons to believe that no safety issues exist. The Utility filed its response on January 20, 2021, proposing supplemental languageto clarify and specify how th
e Utility will implement the new conditions proposed by the court. A hearing on the matter was held on February 3, 2021. OnFebruary 4, 2021, the court enter
ed an order indicating that, if certain alterations were made, the court may be willing to accept the Utility’s proposed modifiedconditions in lieu of the cond
itions proposed in the court’s December 29, 2020 order. All parties and amici responded to the order on February 19, 2021 and anyreplies must be submitt
ed by February 26, 2021. A hearing is scheduled for March 9, 2021.78

On February 4, 2021, the court entered an order requiring the Utility to show cause as to why the additional proposed conditions of probation suggested by amici ina January 27, 2021 filing should not be add
ed. The proposed conditions would require the Utility to: (i) hire a chief data operations officer with the responsibility toreview the Utility’s info
rmation management and record-keeping systems and manage the relationship to operations, including vegetation management work andPSPS; (ii) initiate steps to pr
event data falsification or omission; (iii) propose a plan to mark trees in tier 2 and tier 3 high wildfire danger zones for removal andtrack the status of the 
tree removal process for vegetation management; and (iv) propose steps to improve its information management and records-keeping processto improve information 
integrity, inform analysis, and inform and enhance daily operations including PSPS. The Utility’s, the Monitor’s, and the United States’responses are due by March 3, 2021, and any 
reply by amici is due by March 10, 2021.On February 18, 2021, the court issued an orde
r requiring the Utility to show cause as to why an additional proposed condition of probation, which would requirethe Utility to “identi
fy and remove any tree or portion thereof leaning toward any distribution line if it may contact the line from the side or fall on the line andmust do so
 regardless of the health of the tree[,]” should not be added. The Utility’s response is due by March 4, 2021, any response by the United States and/oramici is due by March 11, 2021, and th
e Utility’s reply is due by March 17, 2021. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for March 23, 2021.In the course of 2020 and 2021, the cour
t entered numerous other orders, including in connection with the Utility’s vegetation management, the Utility’s PSPSprogram, the 2018 Camp fire, th
e 2019 Kincade fire, and the 2020 Zogg fire.The Utility expects to
 receive additional orders from the court in the future.Order Instituting an Investigation into PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Saf
ety CultureOn August 27, 2015, the CPUC began a formal investigation 
into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utilityprioritize safety 
and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards (the “Safety Culture OII”). The CPUC directedthe SED to evaluate the Utili
ty’s and PG&E Corporation’s organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to theUtility’s record of oper
ations, including its record of safety incidents. The SED engaged a consultant to assist in the SED’s investigation and the preparation of areport containing the SED’s assess
ment, and subsequently, to report on the implementation by the Utility of the consultant’s recommendations.On June 18, 2019, the CPUC issued a ruling requesting comm
ents from parties on four proposals that it stated may improve the safety culture of PG&ECorporation and the Utility. The 
four proposals are: separating the Utility into gas and electric utilities (including, as one possibility, sale of the gas assets to a thirdparty); establishing pe
riodic review of the Utility’s certificate of convenience and necessity; modifying or eliminating PG&E Corporation’s holding companystructure; and linking th
e Utility’s rate of return or return on equity to safety performance metrics. Opening comments on the ruling were filed on July 19, 2019 andreply comments were fi
led on August 2, 2019.On September 4, 2020, the ALJ issued a ruling upda
ting case status, which states that the proceeding will remain open as a vehicle to monitor the progress of theUtility in improving its sa
fety culture, and to address any relevant issues that arise, with the CPUC’s consultant NorthStar Consulting Group, Inc. continuing in amonitoring role. The ruling s
tates that additional issues may be raised in the proceedings by parties or the CPUC.REGULATORY MATTERS
The Utility is subject to subst
antial regulation by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC, and other federal and state regulatory agencies. The resolutions of theproceedings described below and o
ther proceedings may materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,and cash flows.
79

Rate Cases2020 Cost of Capital Proceeding
On December 19, 2019, the CPUC approved a final dec
ision in the 2020 Cost of Capital proceeding, maintaining the Utility’s return on common equity at the 2019level of 10.25% for the thr
ee-year period beginning January 1, 2020, as compared to 12% requested by the Utility. The Utility’s annual cost of capital adjustmentmechanism, which allows for ch
anges in the Utility’s authorized ROE and cost of debt, also remains unchanged. In any year in which the difference between theaverage Moody’s utility bond r
ates, as measured in the 12-month period from October through September, and 4.5% (the benchmark) exceeds 100 basis points, theUtility’s ROE will be adjusted by one-h
alf of such difference, and the cost of debt will be trued up to the most recent recorded cost of debt. The Utility can initiatethis adjustment mechan
ism by filing an advice letter on or before October 15, to become effective on January 1 of the next year. The mechanism did not trigger inSeptember 2020; however, as of Dece
mber 31, 2020, the index is more than 100 basis points below the 4.5% benchmark. If the mechanism triggers in October2021, then for 2022 the ROE and the cost of debt wi
ll be adjusted accordingly. The decision maintains the common equity component of the Utility’s capitalstructure at 52%, as requ
ested by the Utility, and reduces its preferred stock component from 1% to 0.5%, also as requested by the Utility. The decision alsoapproves the cost of debt requ
ested by the Utility.On May 28, 2020, the CPUC issued a decision in the OII to Consider PG&E Corpor
ation’s and the Utility’s Plan of Reorganization that directed the Utility tosubmit an Advice Letter to upd
ate its authorized cost of debt within 30 days of the Effective Date of the Plan. On July 22, 2020, the Utility submitted an AdviceLetter requesting to upda
te the authorized cost of long-term debt to implement the interest cost savings resulting from the Utility’s exit financing. On August 20,2020, the CPUC approved the Utility’s request 
to update the authorized cost of long-term debt from 5.16%, as authorized in December 2019, to 4.17% effectiveJuly 1, 2020.
2017 General Rate Case
As previously disclosed, on September 13, 2019 
the Utility submitted an advice letter containing a revised computation of its revenue requirement due to theeffects of the Tax Act, which 
indicated a $282 million net reduction to the 2018 revenue requirement and a $291 million net reduction to the 2019 revenuerequirement. The revis
ed gas revenue requirements increased by $21 million and $11 million for years 2018 and 2019, respectively, and the revised electricrevenue requirements d
ecreased by $304 million and $302 million for years 2018 and 2019, respectively. On October 17, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’sadvice letter. The Uti
lity incorporated the gas revenue requirement increases into rates through its Annual Gas True-up advice letter beginning on January 1, 2020and amortized over 12 m
onths. The Utility incorporated the electric revenue requirement reductions into rates through its Annual Electric True-up advice letterbeginning on May 1, 2020. The Utility incorpo
rated the total $606 million electric revenue requirement reduction as follows: (i) $175 million related to electricgeneration was amortiz
ed over 12 months, (ii) the 2018 revenue requirement reduction of $215 million related to electric distribution was amortized over 10months, and (iii) the 2019 rev
enue requirement reduction of $216 million related to electric distribution was included in the Utility’s 2021 Annual Electric True-upbeginning on January 1, 2021, to be amort
ized over 12 months. The IRS is expected to provide additional guidance on the average rate assumption method. ThisIRS guidance may impact the Ut
ility’s calculation of the related revenue requirement. It is uncertain when the IRS guidance may be issued.2020 General Rate Case
On December 3, 2020, the CPUC approved the final de
cision for the Utility’s 2020 GRC.The final decision adopted 
most of the provisions in the settlement agreement that the Utility, together with the settling parties, jointly submitted to the CPUC onDecember 20, 2019
 (the “settlement agreement”).80

Revenue Requirements and Attrition Year RevenuesThe final decision approved 
a 2020 authorized revenue requirement of $9.102 billion, an increase of $585 million over the 2019 authorized revenue requirement,effective January 1, 2020, as p
rovided in the settlement agreement. The CPUC also approved the revenue requirements for 2021 and 2022 included in thesettlement agree
ment as follows: an additional increase of $316 million in 2021 over the authorized 2020 revenue requirement, or a 3.5% increase, and anadditional increase o
f $364 million in 2022, or a 3.9% increase. The revenue requirements will be further modified by advice letters to reflect an updated cost ofdebt, to remove certa
in customer deposits balances, and to return to customers the excess accumulated deferred income taxes that were created by the passage ofthe 2017 Tax Act. Subject to the CPUC approving the adv
ice letters, the effective dates for the 2021 and 2022 attrition year revenue requirements will be March 1,2021, and January 1, 2022, respectively. Th
e 2021 attrition year revenue requirement will not be implemented in rates until March 1, 2021. The Utility isauthorized to collec
t in rates the difference between the revenue requirement in effect and the 2020 GRC decision-authorized revenue requirement for the period ofJanuary 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021 over the pe
riod of March 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022.The final decision also app
roves, among other things, the settlement agreement provision that allows the Utility to recover the annual cost of excess liabilityinsurance for coverage o
f up to $1.4 billion. An advice letter is required for recovery of excess liability insurance costs for coverage exceeding $1.4 billion. Thefinal decision also approv
ed wildfire mitigation capital expenditures in the Community Wildfire Safety Program of $603 million in 2020, $931 million in 2021 and$1.15 billion in 2022, as provided in the s
ettlement agreement. In addition, the final decision requires a reasonableness review and recovery of WMBA costs orunit costs for system harden
ing in excess of 115% of the adopted amounts and VMBA costs in excess of 120% of the adopted amounts through an application.The following table shows the revenu
e requirement amounts approved in the final decision based on line of business and cost category as well as the differencesbetween the 2019 authorized r
evenue requirements and the amounts approved in the final decision:(in millions)

$ 9,102  $585  Rate Base and Capital Additions
The CPUC also adopted the rate base amoun
ts proposed in the settlement agreement: the 2019 weighted-average rate base of $27.7 billion was increased by $1.7billion, effective J
anuary 1, 2020, to $29.5 billion, or a 6.2% increase; rate base of $31.0 billion in 2021, or a 5.4% increase; and $33.0 billion in 2022, or a 6.3%increase. Consistent with AB 1054, the adopt
ed rate base amounts include $140 million for August to December 2019, $603 million for 2020, $931 million for2021 and $1.15 billion for 2022, for a tot
al of $2.83 billion in forecast capital spend without an equity return.Over the 2020-2022 GRC period, the decision provid
es average annual capital investments of approximately $4.5 billion in electric distribution, natural gasdistribution and electric ge
neration infrastructure.81

Consistent with the Utility’s GRC application, the settlement agreement did not propose funding for claims resulting from the 2017 Northern California wildfiresor the 2018 Camp fire. Also, the Util
ity did not seek recovery of compensation for PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s officers.2023 General Rate Case
In accordance with a Janua
ry 16, 2020 CPUC decision in its OIR to Develop a Risk-Based Decision-Making Framework to Evaluate Safety and ReliabilityImprovements and Revise the GRC Plan, the Ut
ility is required to file with the CPUC on June 30, 2021 a single “general rate case” application requestingintegrated GRC and GT&S related rev
enue requirements for test year 2023 and three attrition years. The Utility expects to file the 2023 GRC by June 30, 2021.On June 30, 2020, the Utility filed the 2020 RAMP Report in 
advance of its 2023 GRC filing. On November 25, 2020, the CPUC’s SPD released its evaluation ofthe Utility’s 2020 RAMP Report. The SPD found that “[t]h
e 2020 RAMP showed marked improvements in risk modeling rigor, data quality, and transparency overprevious rate cases,” but 
cautioned that the Utility’s “track record calls for continued improvements by PG&E and continued rigorous oversight by theCommission.” The SPD held a workshop on its evaluat
ion of the Utility’s RAMP on December 8, 2020, and opening and reply comments were submitted onJanuary 15, 2021 and January 29, 2021, respect
ively.2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case
As previously disclosed, in its fin
al decisions in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case, the CPUC excluded from rate base $696 million of capital spending in 2011through 2014. This was the amount forec
ast to be recorded in excess of the amount adopted in the 2011 GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed$120 million of that amount 
and ordered that the remaining $576 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility mayseek recovery in a futur
e proceeding. The audit report was released June 2, 2020 and did not recommend any additional disallowances. The 2015 GT&S decisionauthorized the Utility 
to seek recovery, through a separate application, of those costs not recommended for disallowance by the audit. On July 31, 2020, the Utilityfiled an application s
eeking recovery of $373.3 million in revenue associated with $512 million of recorded capital expenditures. On October 16, 2020, theassigned commissioner issued 
a scoping memo establishing the scope and schedule for the proceeding. On January 20, 2021, the Utility provided supplementaltestimony addressing the r
easonableness of the capital expenditures. The scoping memo calls for the issuance of a proposed decision in the fourth quarter of 2021.On November 10, 2020, the Utility filed 
a motion seeking approximately $100 million in interim rates, assuming the CPUC reaches a final decision in this matterin late 2021 or early 2022. The CPUC has not yet ru
led upon the Utility’s motion.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing and outcome of this application.As previously disclosed, as a resul
t of the Tax Act, on October 17, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s advice letter including a revised computation of theeffects of the Tax Act on th
e revenue requirements, resulting in a $61 million reduction to the 2018 revenue requirement. The Utility incorporated the revenuerequirement reduct
ion into rates through its Annual Gas True-up advice letter beginning January 1, 2020 and amortized over 12 months. The IRS is expected toprovide additional guidanc
e on the average rate assumption method. This IRS guidance may impact the Utility’s calculation of the related revenue requirement. Itis uncertain when the IRS guidance 
may be issued.2019 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case
As previously disclosed, on September 12, 2019, 
the CPUC voted out the final decision in the 2019 GT&S rate case of the Utility. By approving the decision, theCPUC adopted a 2019 revenue requirement o
f $1.332 billion compared to the Utility’s (revised) request of $1.485 billion. This corresponds to an increase of $31million over the Utili
ty’s 2018 authorized revenue requirement of $1.301 billion, compared to the $184 million increase requested by the Utility. The CPUC alsoadopted revenue require
ments of $1.432 billion for 2020, $1.516 billion for 2021, and $1.580 billion for 2022, compared to the Utility’s request of $1.595 billionfor 2020, $1.693 billion for 2021, and $1.679 bill
ion for 2022.As previously disclosed, on October 23, 2019, the Ut
ility filed an application with the CPUC requesting the rehearing of the final decision. Specifically, issuesidentified by the Utility
 include the adopted disallowance associated with vintage pipe replacement, reduction in the Utility’s expense forecast for in-lineinspections, and establishm
ent of a memo account for Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment. The Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of this matter.82

As previously disclosed, on January 16, 2020, the CPUC approved a final decision in its OIR to Develop a Risk-Based Decision-Making Framework to EvaluateSafety and Reliability I
mprovements and Revise the GRC Plan, as a result of which the Utility will be required to combine the GRC and GT&S rate cases startingwith the 2023 GRC. In accordance with the de
cision, on June 30, 2021, the Utility is required to file with the CPUC a single “general rate case” applicationrequesting integrated GRC and GT&S rel
ated revenue requirements for test year 2023 and three attrition years.Transmission Owner Rate Cases
Transmission Owner Rate Cases for 2015 and 2016 (the “TO16” and “TO17” rate cases, respectively)
As previously disclosed, on January 8, 2018, the Nin
th Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion granting an appeal of the FERC’s decisions in the TO16 andTO17 rate cases that had gran
ted the Utility a 50-basis point ROE incentive adder for its continued participation in the CAISO. If the FERC concluded on remandthat the Utility should no longe
r be authorized to receive the 50 basis point ROE incentive adder, the Utility would incur a refund obligation of $1 million and $8.5million for TO16 and TO17, respectiv
ely. Those rate case decisions were remanded to the FERC for further proceedings consistent with the Court of Appeals’opinion.
On July 18, 2019, the FERC issued its order on remand re
affirming its prior grant of the Utility’s request for the 50-basis point ROE adder. On August 16, 2019, anumber of parties filed for
 rehearing of that order.On March 17, 2020, the FERC issued its order denying the 
requests for rehearing. On May 11, 2020, the CPUC and a number of other parties filed a petition forreview of the FERC’s orders in the Ninth Cir
cuit Court of Appeals. The Utility submitted briefing on November 12, 2020 and the briefing on the appeal wascompleted on December 2, 2020. The Ut
ility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of this proceeding.Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2017 (the “TO18” rate case)
As previously disclosed, on July 29, 2016, the Util
ity filed its TO18 rate case with the FERC requesting a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of$1.72 billion, a $387 million inc
rease over the 2016 revenue requirement of $1.33 billion.  The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2017 was $6.7billion.  The Utility sought a ROE of 10.9%, which 
included an incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO.  Inthe filing, the Utility 
forecasted that it would make investments of $1.30 billion in 2017 in various capital projects.Also, as previously disclosed, on October 1, 2018, 
the ALJ issued an initial decision in the TO18 rate case proposing a ROE of 9.13% compared to the Utility’srequest of 10.9%, and an estim
ated composite depreciation rate of 2.96% compared to the Utility’s request of 3.25%. In addition, the ALJ proposed to reduceforecasted capita
l and expense spending to actual costs incurred for the rate case period. Further, the ALJ proposed to remove certain items from the Utility’s ratebase and revenue require
ment. Finally, the ALJ rejected the Utility’s direct assignment of common plant to FERC and required the allocation of all common plantbetween CPUC and FERC jurisdiction be based on operating 
and maintenance labor ratios. Application of the operating and maintenance labor rates would resultin an allocation of 6.15% of 
common plant to FERC in comparison to 8.84% under the Utility’s direct assignment method. The Utility and intervenors filed initialbriefs on October 31, 2018, and reply br
iefs on November 20, 2018, in response to the ALJ’s initial decision.On October 15, 2020, the FERC issued an order that af
firmed in part and reversed in part the initial decision. The order reopens the record for the limited purposeof allowing the particip
ants to the proceeding an opportunity to present written evidence concerning the FERC’s revised ROE methodology adopted in the FERCOpinion No. 569-A, issued on May 21, 2020, which refined the m
ethodology it established in Opinion No. 569 for setting the ROE that electric utilities areauthorized to earn on el
ectric transmission investments. Initial briefs and testimony were filed on December 14, 2020 and responses were filed on February 12,2021. The Utility’s initial b
rief requested a ROE of 13.29%. In addition, the order approves depreciation rates that yield an estimated composite depreciation rateof 2.94% compared to the Util
ity’s request of 3.25%. Further, the order reduces forecasted capital, operations and maintenance, and cost of debt expense to actualcosts incurred for the r
ate case period. Finally, the order rejected the Utility’s direct assignment of common plant to FERC and required the allocation of allcommon plant between CPUC and FERC jurisdiction be bas
ed on operating and maintenance labor ratios. Aside from the ultimate outcome of the common plantallocation and ROE methodology, which is sub
ject to further briefing, the FERC’s October 15, 2020 order is not expected to result in a material impact on theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Some of the issues that will be decided in a final and unappealable TO18 decision,including the common plant 
allocation, will also be incorporated into the Utility’s current formula rate, described below under the TO20 rate case.83

On November 16, 2020, the Utility submitted a request for rehearing of certain rulings in the FERC’s October 15, 2020 order. The Utility requested in itsapplication, among other 
things, that the FERC allow the Utility to demonstrate that the common, general and intangible plant costs actually occurred. Twointervenors in the case 
also filed for rehearing on net salvage value and the applicability of the Tax Act to the Utility’s rates. On December 17, 2020, the FERCdenied all the pending requ
ests for rehearing. The Utility filed a petition for review of the order on February 11, 2021, and a separate petition for review was jointlyfiled the same day by two othe
r parties.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing and outcome of this proceeding.Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2018 (the “TO19” rate case)
As previously disclosed, on July 27, 2017, the Util
ity filed its TO19 rate case with the FERC requesting a 2018 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of$1.79 billion, a $74 million inc
rease over the proposed 2017 revenue requirement of $1.72 billion. The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2018 was$6.9 billion.  The Utility sought a ROE of 10.75%, which 
includes an incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in theCAISO.  In the filing, the Utility for
ecasted capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion.Also, as previously disclosed, on Septemb
er 21, 2018, the Utility filed an all-party settlement with the FERC in connection with TO19. As part of the settlement,the TO19 revenue requiremen
t will be set at 98.85% of the revenue requirement for TO18 that will be determined upon the issuance of a final, non-appealableTO18 decision. Additionally, if the Cour
t of Appeals were to determine that the Utility was not entitled to the 50 basis point incentive adder for the Utility’scontinued CAISO participation, then 
the Utility would be obligated to make a refund to customers of approximately $25 million. See Transmission Owner RateCases for 2015 and 2016 above for a discussion o
f the incentive adder. On December 20, 2018, the FERC issued an order approving the all-party settlement.Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2019 (the “TO20” rate case)
As previously disclosed, on October 1, 2018, the Ut
ility filed its TO20 rate case with the FERC requesting approval of a formula rate for the costs associated withthe Utility’s elect
ric transmission facilities. On November 30, 2018, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s October 2018 filing, subject to hearings andrefund, and established May 1, 2019 as 
the Effective Date for rate changes. The FERC also ordered that the hearings be held in abeyance pending settlementdiscussions among the parties.
The formula rate rep
laces the “stated rate” methodology that the Utility used in its previous TO rate case filings. The formula rate methodology still includes anauthorized revenue requ
irement and rate base for a given year, but it also provides for an annual update of the following year’s revenue requirement and rates inaccordance with the te
rms of the FERC-approved formula. Under the formula rate mechanism, transmission revenue requirements are updated to the actual cost ofservice annually as part 
of the true-up process. Differences between amounts collected and determined under the formula rate are either collected from or refundedto customers.
On March 31, 2020, the Utility filed 
a partial settlement with the FERC that resolves issues regarding the inputs, and methods used in the formula rate consistentwith FERC precedent. In addition, the pa
rtial settlement establishes a stakeholder transmission asset review process that allows the stakeholders to reviewtransmission capital p
rojects that are not subject to review under the CAISO Transmission Planning Process which would be included in TO rates; allows theUtility to resolve the issu
e of compliance to reconcile the rate base with the CAISO register data base; and requires the Utility to seek the FERC’s authorizationbefore recovering cl
aims related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire. The partial settlement was approved by the FERC on August17, 2020.
On October 15, 2020, the Utility filed 
a settlement with the FERC resolving all of the remaining issues in the Formula Rate Proceedings, including the Utility’sROE, capital structure, depr
eciation rates, as well as certain other aspects of the Utility’s formula rate. Specifically, the settlement establishes an all-in ROE of10.45%; a fixed capital s
tructure of 49.75% common stock, 49.75% debt, and 0.5% preferred stock; and fixed depreciation rates for various categories oftransmission facili
ties (represented by individual FERC accounts). The term of the settlement continues until December 31, 2023 and the Utility will be required tofile a replacement rate filing to be
 effective on January 1, 2024. The settlement also requires the Utility to concurrently file a motion for interim rates requestingthat the settlemen
t rates go into effect on January 1, 2021 while approval of the settlement is pending at the FERC. Also as part of the settlement, the Utility madesupplemental filings to 
revise its request in two FERC dockets on October 15, 2020 addressing the calculation of the Utility’s AFUDC to reflect the terms of thesettlement.
84

On December 30, 2020, the FERC approved the October 15, 2020 settlement without modifications. Also, on December 30, 2020, the FERC approved the twoAFUDC dockets addressing the calculation o
f the Utility’s AFUDC calculation without modifications.Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Triennial Proceeding
While the Utility expe
cts active decommissioning to begin soon after expiration of the current operating licenses, the Utility expects that the decommissioning ofDiablo Canyon will take many years. De
tailed studies of the cost to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities are conducted every three years inconjunction with the NDCTP. Actual decommiss
ioning costs may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such as regulatory, siterestoration, and remed
iation requirements; technology; and costs of labor, materials, and equipment. The Utility recovers its revenue requirements fordecommissioning costs from 
customers through a non-bypassable charge that the Utility expects will continue until those costs are fully recovered.As previously disclosed, on December 13, 2018, 
the Utility submitted its 2018 NDCTP application, which includes a Diablo Canyon site-specific decommissioningcost estimate of $4.8 bil
lion to decommission the Diablo Canyon facilities.Also, as previously disclosed, on January 10, 2020, 
the settlement agreement that the parties had reached in this proceeding was filed with the CPUC, along with ajoint motion for adopti
on of the settlement agreement.Under the proposed settlemen
t agreement, the Utility would collect annual revenue requirements of $112.5 million and $3.9 million for the funding of the DiabloCanyon non-qualified trust and Humbold
t Bay tax qualified trust, respectively, commencing January 1, 2020. Additionally, under the proposed settlementagreement, the $398.4 mil
lion spent for Humboldt Bay Power Plant decommissioning project costs completed to date would be deemed reasonable.On February 22, 2021, the CPUC extended the statutory de
adline to resolve this proceeding to September 13, 2021. A proposed decision is expected in the fourthquarter of 2021.
Application for Wildfire Mitiga
tion and Catastrophic Events Interim RatesOn February 7, 2020, the Utility filed 
an interim relief application seeking $899 million in interim rates related to certain electric distribution costs recorded in thefollowing memorandum accoun
ts: WMPMA, FRMMA, FHPMA, and CEMA. The costs pertain mainly to the years 2017-2019. The application addresses costsrecorded in: (i) the 
WMPMA and FRMMA to comply with the 2019 WMP and other wildfire mitigation costs not otherwise recoverable through rates, (ii) theFHPMA to comply with various fire safety 
rulemakings through 2019, and (iii) the CEMA for responding to, and restoring customer service after, certain stormsand fires occurring in 2017-2019.
The Utility submitted a r
equest on March 23, 2020, to reduce the interim rate relief by $8.4 million. This reduction, which reduces the requested rate relief to $891million, relates to 
the capital cost reduction required by AB 1054.On October 22, 2020, the CPUC voted out its final decis
ion that approved interim relief in the amount of $447 million. The Utility will recover these costs over a17-month period beginning in Janua
ry 2021.Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Costs Recove
ry ApplicationOn September 30, 2020, the Utility fi
led an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of recorded expenditures related to wildfire mitigation, certaincatastrophic events, and 
a number of other activities (the “WMCE application”). The recorded expenditures, which exclude amounts disallowed as a result of theCPUC’s decision in the OII into the 2017 Northern Ca
lifornia Wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, consist of $1.18 billion in expense and $801 million in capitalexpenditures, resulting in 
a revenue requirement of approximately $1.28 billion.The costs addressed in the WMCE appl
ication cover activities mainly during the years 2017 to 2019 and are incremental to those previously authorized in theUtility’s 2017 GRC and other proceedings. The 
majority of costs addressed in this application reflect work necessary to mitigate wildfire risk and to respond tocatastrophic events oc
curring during the years 2017 to 2019. The Utility’s requested revenue includes amounts for the FHPMA of $293 million, the FRMMA andthe WMPMA of $740 million, and the CEMA of $251 mil
lion. The requested revenue for CEMA costs reflected in the application include the Utility’s costsincurred responding to ten c
atastrophic events, including the 2017 Tubbs fire.85

In its application, the Utility proposed the following ratemaking scenario: given the CPUC approval of $447 million in interim rate relief which includes interest,the Utility proposed to recov
er the remaining $868 million revenue requirement, including interest, over a one-year period (following the conclusion of interim raterelief recovery). Cost 
recovery requested in this application is subject to the CPUC’s reasonableness review.On December 23, 2020, the assigned comm
issioner issued a scoping memo and ruling for the proceeding, which calls for a proposed decision to be issued inSeptember 2021.
The Utility is unable to pred
ict the outcome of this application. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cashflows could be material
ly affected if the Utility is unable to timely recover costs included in this application.For more information reg
arding the FHPMA, the FRMMA, the WMPMA, and the CEMA memorandum accounts, see “Wildfire Mitigation Memorandum andBalancing Accounts” and “Catast
rophic Event Memorandum Accounts and Applications” below.Application for Recovery of Costs Recorded in the W
ildfire Expense Memorandum AccountOn February 7, 2020, the Utility filed 
an application seeking recovery of certain costs recorded in the WEMA. In the application, the Utility seeks recovery of$498.7 million for the cost of 
insurance premiums paid by the Utility between July 26, 2017 through December 31, 2019 that is incremental to the insurance costsalready authorized in 
the 2017 GRC or the 2020 GRC. These incremental costs are not associated with any specific wildfire event. The application does not seekrecovery of wildfire c
laims or associated legal costs eligible for recording to WEMA.On April 2, 2020, the CPUC held a prehearing confer
ence in this matter. On January 12, 2021, the CPUC issued a scoping memo establishing the scope andschedule for the proceed
ing. As amended by subsequent rulings, the schedule calls for a final decision in August 2021. The Utility cannot predict the outcome ofthis proceeding.
Catastrophic Event Memorandum Accounts and Applications
The CPUC allows utilities to recover 
the reasonable, incremental costs of responding to catastrophic events that have been declared a disaster or state of emergencyby competent federal o
r state authorities through a CEMA. In 2014, the CPUC directed the Utility to perform additional fire prevention and vegetationmanagement work in response to 
the severe drought in California. The costs associated with this work are tracked in the CEMA. In the 2020 GRC Decision, theCPUC required the Utility to track 
these costs in the VMBA beginning January 1, 2020. The Utility’s CEMA applications are subject to CPUC review andapproval. For more informa
tion see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.2019 CEMA Application
On September 13, 2019, the Utility submi
tted to the CPUC its 2019 CEMA application requesting cost recovery of $159.3 million in connection with 13catastrophic events th
at included 12 wildfires and one storm for declared emergencies from mid-2017 through 2018. The 2019 CEMA application does not includecosts related to the 2015 Butt
e fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires, or the 2018 Camp fire.On August 31, 2020 the Utility, TURN and the PAO filed a joint mot
ion seeking approval and adoption of a settlement agreement reached between the settlingparties. The settlem
ent agreement proposes a total revenue requirement of $136.7 million consisting of an expense revenue requirement of $112 million and acapital revenue requ
irement for 2017 through 2022 of $24.7 million.On November 19, 2020, the CPUC issued a final decision adop
ting the settlement agreement.2018 CEMA Application
On March 30, 2018, the Utility submitt
ed to the CPUC its 2018 CEMA application requesting cost recovery of $183 million in connection with seven catastrophicevents that included fi
re and storm declared emergencies from mid-2016 through early 2017, as well as $405 million related to work performed in 2016 and 2017to cut back or remove dead o
r dying trees that were exposed to years of drought conditions and bark beetle infestation.86

On April 25, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s request for interim rate relief, allowing for recovery of $373 million of costs as requested by the Utility at thattime, compared to $588 mi
llion requested by the Utility. The interim rate relief was implemented on October 1, 2019. Costs included in the interim rate relief aresubject to audit and refund. On August 7, 2019, th
e Utility filed a revised application, revised testimony and revised workpapers, reflecting a new revenuerequirement request o
f $669 million, pursuant to a CPUC ruling allowing these changes.The 2018 CEMA application does not include 
costs related to the 2015 Butte fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires, or the 2018 Camp fire.On March 9, 2020, the CPUC issued a modified scoping me
mo and ruling. On May 4, 2020, the Utility filed a revised application, which included 2019 treemortality costs, ref
lecting a new revenue requirement request of $757 million, and the costs of an independent auditor to be hired for audit of all vegetationmanagement costs and related
 interest calculations.On January 8, 2021, the Utility filed 
a revised application updating the revenue requirement to include an additional $5.6 million of tree mortality costs and thecost of hiring an independent 
auditor.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing and outcome of this proceeding.Wildfire Mitigation Me
morandum and Balancing AccountsFire Hazard Prevention Memorandum Account
The CPUC allows utilities to track and 
record costs associated with implementing regulations and requirements adopted to protect the public from potential firehazards associated with
 overhead power line facilities and nearby aerial communication facilities that have not been previously authorized in another proceeding.The Utility tracked such cos
ts in the FHPMA through the end of 2019.On December 17, 2019, the Utility, the SED of th
e CPUC, the CPUC’s OSA, and CUE jointly submitted to the CPUC a proposed settlement agreement inconnection with the OII into th
e 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Utility agrees, among otherthings, to not seek recovery of $36 
million of wildfire-related expenses recorded in the FHPMA. For more information on the settlement agreement, see Note 15 ofthe Notes to the Consolidated Financ
ial Statements in Item 8.Other than the amounts subjec
t to the settlement agreement, as modified by the Decision Different approved on May 7, 2020, in connection with the OII into the2017 Northern California wildfi
res and the 2018 Camp fire, the Utility believes such costs are recoverable, but rate recovery requires CPUC reasonablenessreview.
The Utility requested re
covery of costs recorded in the FHPMA in its Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Costs Recovery Application described above.(See “Wildfire Mit
igation and Catastrophic Events Costs Recovery Application” above.)The amount reflected 
in this memorandum account as of December 31, 2020 was $258 million. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statementsin Item 8.
Fire Risk Mitigation Memorandum Account
On March 12, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s FRMMA to track 
costs incurred beginning January 1, 2019, for fire risk mitigation activities that are nototherwise covered in revenu
e requirements. The FRMMA was authorized to capture mitigation costs of activities not included in a CPUC approved WMP.  TheUtility has proposed that the FRMMA continu
e after the approval of its 2019 WMP to record costs of wildfire mitigation activities that were beyond the initialidentified scope of work or a
re incurred prior to approval of the WMP in which they are proposed. The FRMMA includes costs associated with the 2019 WMPfrom the period January 1, 2019 th
rough June 4, 2019, as well as subsequent wildfire mitigation costs not included in the WMPMA, discussed below. Recovery ofcosts are subject to CPUC review and approv
al. The Utility will continue to use the FRMMA for new programs or expanded scope of existing programs before theWMP is approved.
87

On December 17, 2019, the Utility, the SED of the CPUC, the CPUC’s OSA, and CUE jointly submitted to the CPUC a proposed settlement agreement inconnection with the OII into th
e 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Utility agreed, among otherthings, not to seek recovery of $236 
million of wildfire-related expenses recorded in the FRMMA and the WMPMA. For more information on the settlementagreement, see Note 15 of th
e Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.The Utility requested re
covery of costs recorded in the FRMMA in its Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Costs Recovery Application, except for theamounts subject to the set
tlement agreement, as modified by the Decision Different approved on May 7, 2020, in connection with the OII into the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires and 
the 2018 Camp fire. (See “Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Costs Recovery Application” above.) PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to timely recover costs in connectionwith the 2019 WMP recorded in the FRMMA.
The amount reflected 
in this memorandum account as of December 31, 2020 was $99 million. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements inItem 8.
Wildfire Mitigation Balancing Account
In the 2020 GRC Decision, the CPUC authorized the Utili
ty to establish the WMBA effective January 1, 2020, to track and record actual expenses incurred and thecapital revenue requirement ass
ociated with actual capital additions incurred compared to the total adopted revenue requirements for specified wildfire mitigationactivities, for the p
eriod beginning January 1, 2020. The WMBA is a two-way balancing account, which allows the Utility to seek cost recovery for amountsexceeding the approved rev
enue requirement, subject to a demonstration of reasonableness. The Utility is required to submit an application to the CPUC to recoverthe costs of program expendi
tures exceeding 115% of the adopted amounts or if the average overhead or underground system hardening per mile unit costs exceedspecified unit costs by 115%.
The amount reflected 
in this balancing account as of December 31, 2020 was $183 million. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements inItem 8.
Wildfire Mitigation Plan Memorandum Account
As previously disclosed, on June 5, 2019, the Util
ity submitted an advice letter to establish the WMPMA (also called the Wildfire Mitigation Plan MemorandumAccount) effective May 30, 2019. Th
e WMPMA is required to be established upon approval of a utility’s WMP to track costs incurred to implement the Utility’sWMPs. The CPUC approved the memorandum account on August 8, 2019, so 
the Utility has recorded costs incurred in implementing the WMPs, as of June 5,2019, the effective dat
e of the WMPMA.The Utility requested re
covery of costs recorded in the WMPMA in its Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Costs Recovery Application, except for theamounts subject to the set
tlement agreement, as modified by the Decision Different approved on May 7, 2020, in connection with the OII into the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires and 
the 2018 Camp fire. (See “Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Costs Recovery Application” above.) PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s financial 
condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to timely recover costs in connectionwith the 2019 WMP and the 2020 WMP recorded in 
the WMPMA.The amount reflected 
in this memorandum account as of December 31, 2020 was $551 million. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statementsin Item 8.
Vegetation Management Balancing Account
The VMBA was approved by the CPUC in the Utility’s 1999 GRC as a one-way balanc
ing account mechanism to recover the costs of routine vegetationmanagement expenditur
es, in an amount not to exceed the approved revenue requirement. In the 2020 GRC Decision, the CPUC authorized the Utility to modifythe VMBA as a two-way balancing account, which 
allows the Utility to seek recovery of expenditures incurred above the revenue requirement, subject to ademonstration of reasonab
leness, for the period beginning January 1, 2020. The account was further modified to include the Utility’s new enhanced vegetationmanagement program and 
additional vegetation management costs currently recorded in the CEMA for which there is no approved revenue requirement. TheUtility is required to subm
it an application to the CPUC to recover the costs of program expenditures exceeding 120% of the adopted amounts. If the Utility’sexpenditures are less th
an the approved revenue requirement, the Utility will return any over collection to customers through an advice letter.88

The amount reflected in this balancing account as of December 31, 2020 was $707 million. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements inItem 8.
Risk Transfer Balancing Account
In the 2020 GRC Decision, the CPUC authorized the Utili
ty to establish the RTBA effective January 1, 2020, to track and record actual expenses incurredcompared to the adopted r
evenue requirements for the GRC portion of excess liability insurance costs, inclusive of all financial risk transfer mechanisms(insurance, reinsuranc
e, catastrophe bonds, captives), and related costs (such as broker fees and excise taxes). The Utility would seek recovery of any risk transfercosts associated with cover
age above $1.4 billion, through an advice letter.The RTBA is a two-way balancing account tha
t tracks and records the GRC portion of actual financial risk transfer costs incurred compared to adopted amounts.Adopted amounts and actual costs 
incurred allocated to the Utility’s GT&S rate case and TO rate case will be recorded to authorized mechanisms applicable tothose rate cases, speci
fically, the adjustment mechanism for GT&S-related amounts and the Utility’s FERC formula rates for TO related amounts.For more information about 
the RTBA, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.Emergency Authorization and Order Directing Util
ities to Implement Emergency Customer COVID-19 ProtectionsIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on April 16, 2020, 
the CPUC adopted a resolution ordering utilities to implement a number of emergency customerprotections for one year b
eginning on March 4, 2020 through April 16, 2021, including:•
waive deposit requirements for residential customers seeking to reestablish service for one year;•
implement payment plan options for residential customers;•
suspend disconnection for nonpayment and associated fees, waive deposit and late fee requirements for residential and small business customers;•
support low-income residential customers by:◦
freezing all standard and high-usage reviews for the CARE program eligibility for 12 months and potentially longer, as warranted;◦
contacting all community outreach contractors, the community-based organizations that assist in enrolling hard-to-reach low-income customersinto CARE, to help better inform cus
tomers of these eligibility changes;◦
partnering with the program administrator of the customer funded emergency assistance program for low-income customers and increasing theassistance limit a
mount for the next 12 months; and◦
indicate how the energy savings assistance program can be deployed to assist customers;•
suspend all CARE and Federal Emergency Relief Administration program removals to avoid unintentional loss of the discounted rate during the periodfor which the customer is pro
tected under these customer protections;•
discontinue generating all recertification and verification requests that require customers to provide their current income information;•
offer repair processing and timing assistance and timely access to utility customers;•
include these customer protections as part of their larger community outreach and public awareness plans;•
meet and confer with the CCAs as early as possible to discuss their roles and responsibilities for each emergency customer protection.The resolution also authori
zes utilities to establish memorandum accounts to track incremental costs associated with complying with the resolution. On February11, 2021, the CPUC approved a resolution extending th
e moratorium on service disconnections for residential and small business customers to June 30, 2021.89

On June 11, 2020, the CPUC issued a final decision as part of the OIR to Consider New Approaches to Disconnections and Reconnections to Improve EnergyAccess and Contain Costs that perman
ently eliminated deposit requirements for residential customers. On December 21, 2020, a CPUC ALJ issued a rulingseeking comments on a
n approach to implement a temporary moratorium on service disconnections for medium-large commercial and industrial customers.PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e unable to predict whether this resolution will be extended or expanded to additional customer classes, which could have amaterial impac
t on results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Utility.COVID-19 Pandemic Protections Memorandum Account
On May 1, 2020, the Utility submitted an 
advice letter to establish the CPPMA. The purpose of the CPPMA is to track costs incurred to implement the CPUC’sEmergency Authorization and Ord
er Directing Utilities to Implement Emergency Customer Protections to Support California Customers During the COVID-19Pandemic. Costs included in the CPPMA will includ
e incremental uncollectibles expense for residential and small business customers, incremental financing costsas a result of lower accoun
ts receivable collections for residential and small business customers, and the costs of complying with various customer protectionsdescribed in “Emergency Autho
rization and Order Directing Utilities to Implement Emergency Customer COVID-19 Protections,” above. The Utility intends toseek recovery of the CPPMA balance in 
a future application, recovery of which will require CPUC reasonableness review.On June 2, 2020 and July 15, 2020, the Utility submitt
ed updated advice letters to modify and clarify prior proposals based on CPUC guidance. On July 27, 2020,the CPUC approved the Utility’s advice 
letter.The amount reflected 
in this memorandum account as of December 31, 2020 was $84 million, of which $76 million relates to incremental uncollectible expenses.See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidat
ed Financial Statements in Item 8.Other Regulatory Proceedings
Application to Sell General Office Compl
exOn September 30, 2020, the Utility fi
led an application with the CPUC to sell its SFGO located at 215 Market Street, 245 Market Street, 77 Beale Street, 50 MainStreet, 25 Beale Street, and 45 Be
ale Street in downtown San Francisco, and to cover costs to relocate its staff at SFGO to a new headquarters to the LakesideBuilding, and for appropriate 
ratemaking treatment of those transactions.The Utility proposes the SFGO sale and headqua
rters transition proceed in several interrelated steps: the Utility has entered into a lease for the Lakeside Buildingwith an option to purchase the Lak
eside Building; the Utility will market and sell the SFGO, subject to CPUC approval; and the Utility will enter into an agreementwith the buyer of the SFGO to lease back spa
ce during the multi-year relocation period (collectively, the “Transactions”). As space in the Lakeside Buildingbecomes available fo
llowing the expiration of existing tenants’ leases and completion of the redevelopment of the property to the Utility’s specifications, theUtility will relocat
e employees and operations from the SFGO and certain East Bay office locations to the Lakeside Building in phases over several years,beginning in 2022.
In this application, the Ut
ility requests that the CPUC: (i) authorize the Utility to sell the SFGO pursuant to Public Utilities Code section 851, (ii) approve theUtility’s ratemaking p
roposal to distribute all of the gain on sale of the SFGO to customers over five years, beginning in 2022, (iii) approve the recovery of costs tolease back the SFGO after the bui
ldings are sold, costs to lease the Lakeside Building, and other transition costs, and (iv) authorize the Utility to forecast theintended purchase of the Lak
eside Building and include it in the Utility’s 2023 GRC. The Utility also proposes to establish a balancing account to record leasepayments, net savings or costs on ope
rating expense and capital expense, gain on sale, moving costs and related costs for inclusion in electric and gas rates.On December 1, 2020, the CPUC held a prehearing con
ference in this matter. On December 15, 2020, the assigned commissioner issued a scoping memo, whichsets forth the category, 
issues to be addressed, and schedule of the proceeding. The scoping memo contemplates a CPUC final decision as early as August 2021 andprovides for additional t
imeline flexibility depending on the pace of the sale process.PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e unable to predict the timing and outcome of this proceeding.90

Application for Post-Emergence Securitization TransactionOn April 30, 2020, the Utility filed an 
application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a post-emergence transaction to securitize $7.5 billion of 2017 wildfireclaims costs that is des
igned to be rate neutral to customers, with the proceeds used to pay or reimburse the Utility for the payment of wildfire claims costsassociated with 2017 Northern Cali
fornia wildfires. Among other uses, as a result of the proposed transaction, the Utility would retire $6.0 billion of Utility debtand accelerate a $592 
million payment due to the Fire Victim Trust. Specifically, the application requests administration of the stress test methodology approved inthe CHT OIR and a determination tha
t $7.5 billion in 2017 catastrophic wildfire costs and expenses are stress test costs and eligible for securitization. In thiscontext, a securitiz
ation refers to a financing transaction where a special purpose financing vehicle issues new debt that is secured by the proceeds of a newrecovery charge to Util
ity customers. The application also proposes a customer credit designed to equal the bond charges over the life of the bond, which wouldinsulate customers fro
m the charge on customer bills associated with the bonds. The Utility proposes to fund the customer credit through a trust that consists ofshareholder assets includ
ing: (1) an initial contribution of $1.8 billion; (2) up to $7.59 billion of additional contributions funded by certain shareholder tax benefits;and (3) investment retu
rns on the assets in the trust. The Utility also proposes to share with customers 25% of any surplus of shareholder assets in the customercredit trust at the end of
 the life of the trust.Protests and response to the appl
ication were due June 4, 2020 and the Utility filed a reply on June 12, 2020. A prehearing conference was held on June 18, 2020.The assigned commissioner issu
ed the scoping memo on July 28, 2020 and directed the Utility to file updated testimony, if any, based on its post-emergencefinancial status by August 7, 2020. On August 7, 2020, the Uti
lity served its updated testimony, in which it discussed, among other things, PG&E Corporation’sand Utility’s exit finan
cings from Chapter 11 and related equity issuances, including to the Fire Victim Trust, in connection with consummating the Plan on July 1,2020; issuance of revised cr
edit ratings; updated financial forecasts for the Utility and their impacts on the securitization application, including on the stress testcosts and the customer cr
edit trust; and certain expected tax impacts.Intervenor testimony was se
rved on October 14, 2020, and the Utility’s rebuttal testimony was submitted on November 11, 2020. An evidentiary hearing was heldon December 7-16, 2020. Opening briefs wer
e submitted on January 15, 2021, and reply briefs were submitted on February 1, 2021. In a post-hearing briefing, theUtility and other parti
es in the proceeding included potential conditions and alternatives for the CPUC’s consideration. In post-hearing briefing, the Utility includedan alternative proposa
l for the CPUC’s consideration comprised of four elements: (1) a $200 million increase in the initial shareholder contribution, from $1.8billion to $2 billion, provided 
that $1 billion is contributed in 2021 and $1 billion in 2024; (2) potential shift in the customer credit trust’s investment portfolio to agreater proportion of f
ixed income investments; (3) a single CPUC review of the balance of the customer credit trust in 2040, with a single contingent supplementalshareholder contribution, 
if needed, up to $775 million in 2040; and (4) a reduced sharing of any trust surplus with customers to 10%. The Utility anticipates aCPUC decision in the second quarter of 2021.
On January 6, 2021, the Utility filed 
an application requesting that the CPUC issue a financing order authorizing the issuance of one or more series of recoverybonds in connection with the post-e
mergence transaction to securitize the $7.5 billion of claims associated with the 2017 Northern California Wildfires referencedabove. On January 7, 2021, the Utility fi
led a motion to consolidate the pending application seeking authorization for a post-emergence transaction and theapplication for a fin
ancing order. The ALJ granted the Utility’s motion to shorten the time for protests to January 22, 2021, and the Utility filed a reply on February1, 2021. A prehearing conference was h
eld on February 5, 2021. On February 10, 2021, certain intervenors filed a joint motion to dismiss the Utility’s applicationfor a financing order. On Februa
ry 17, 2021, the Utility filed a response opposing the motion to dismiss. Also on February 17, 2021, the PAO filed a responsesupporting the motion to dismiss. Th
e Utility expects a CPUC decision on the financing order by May 6, 2021.Application for AB 1054 Securitization Transaction
On February 24, 2021 the Utility filed 
an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a transaction to securitize up to a principal amount of approximately$1.19 billion related to f
ire risk mitigation capital expenditures that have been or will be incurred by the Utility in 2020 and 2021.  The $1.19 billion reflects capitalexpenditures related 
to the Utility’s Community Wildfire Safety Program, which were approved by the CPUC in the 2020 GRC, and include $655 million inrecorded 2020 capital exp
enditures and an additional $535 million in forecast capital expenditures in 2021.  The final amount to be securitized would be based onrecorded 2020 and 2021 Community Wild
fire Safety Program expenditures incurred by the Utility.91

The application requests that the CPUC issue a financing order authorizing one or more series of recovery bonds, determine that the issuance of the bonds andcollection through fixed 
recovery charges is just and reasonable, consistent with the public interest and would reduce rates on a present value basis compared totraditional utili
ty financing mechanisms, and authorize the Utility to collect a non-bypassable recovery charge sufficient to pay debt service on the recovery bonds. The application also requ
ests to exclude the securitized debt from the Utility’s ratemaking capital structure and to adjust its GRC revenue requirement followingthe issuance of the recov
ery bonds.  The proposed procedural schedule requests a final decision on all issues by June 24, 2021 and the application indicates that theissuance of the bonds is antic
ipated to occur before the end of 2021, but is subject to change.2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan
As previously disclosed, on October 25, 2018, the CPUC opened an OIR to i
mplement the provisions of SB 901 related to electric utility WMPs. This OIRprovided guidance on the form 
and content of the initial WMPs, provided a venue for review of the initial plans, and developed and refined the content of andprocess for review and impl
ementation of WMPs to be filed in future years. In this proceeding the CPUC determined, among other things, how to interpret andapply SB 901’s list of required plan 
elements, as well as what additional elements beyond those required in SB 901 should be included in the WMPs. SB 901 alsorequires, among other things, 
that such plans include a description of the preventive strategies and programs to be adopted by an electrical corporation to minimizethe risk of its electrical lines
 and equipment causing catastrophic wildfires, including the consideration of dynamic climate change risks, plans for vegetationmanagement, and plans f
or inspections of the electrical corporation’s electrical infrastructure. The scope of this proceeding does not include utility recovery ofcosts related to WMPs, which SB 901 requir
es to be addressed in separate rate recovery applications.On February 6, 2019, the Utility filed 
its first WMP, the 2019 WMP, with the CPUC, and amended it subsequently on February 12, 2019 and February 14, 2019.On May 30, 2019, the CPUC approved the 2019 WMP. (The Utility also f
iled an amendment to the plan on April 25, 2019, but CPUC approval did not extend tothat amendment.)
2020-2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan
As previously disclosed, on February 7, 2020, the Ut
ility submitted its 2020 WMP and utility survey. The Utility’s 2020 WMP describes the Utility’s wildfiresafety programs, whic
h are focused on three key areas: reducing the potential for fires to be started by electrical equipment, reducing the potential for fires tospread, and minimizing th
e frequency, scope and duration of Public Safety Power Shut-off events, as well as providing historical data requested by the guidelines.The Utility’s 2020 WMP covers a thr
ee-year period from 2020-2022 but is updated annually.On March 18, 2020, the CPUC issued a decision in this proc
eeding, clarifying that the CPUC’s newly created WSD would review 2020 WMPs, present resolutionsfor CPUC consideration on the 2020 Plans, and overse
e independent evaluation and other compliance activity with regard to both 2019 and 2020 Plans.On June 11, 2020, the CPUC voted to adopt two resolutions which condit
ionally approved the Utility’s 2020 WMP. The resolutions indicate that while the Utility’s2020 WMP met the minimum requ
irements for its submission, the deficiencies found, classified as severity level A, B, or C Conditions, require significant follow-up from the Utility and overs
ight to ensure appropriate remedies for the deficiencies. The Utility received 41 Conditions in total with the first set, classified asClass A Conditions, submitted on July 27, 2020. The second se
t, Class B Conditions, were completed on September 9, 2020 and the third, Class C Conditions,were submitted as part of 
the 2021 WMP update on February 5, 2021. On December 30, 2020, the WSD issued a Notice of Non-Compliance finding that theUtility’s responses to the Class A Condit
ions were insufficient. The WSD has required the Utility to include 39 action items in its 2021 WMP to address theinsufficient responses. On Janua
ry 8, 2021, the WSD issued a Notice of Non-Compliance finding that the Utility’s quarterly report addressing the Class BConditions was insufficient. The WSD has di
rected the Utility to respond to 84 action items in its 2021 WMP or via a supplemental filing by February 26, 2021.Failure to remedy insuff
iciencies in the 2020-2022 WMP could lead to enforcement actions by the CPUC, including potentially placing the Utility in the EnhancedOversight and Enforcement Proc
ess, and making the Utility unable to obtain an AB 1054 safety certification and, as a result, unable to access the Wildfire Fund,which could have a materi
al effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.The Utility’s 2021 WMP was submitted on Febru
ary 5, 2021. The 2021 WMP was an update to the 2020 WMP and addressed the Utility’s wildfire safetyprograms focused on reducing th
e potential for catastrophic wildfires related to electrical equipment, reducing the potential for fires to spread, and making PSPSevents smaller, shorter an
d smarter for customers.92

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is unable totimely recover costs 
in connection with the 2019 WMP, 2020 WMP, and 2021 WMP recorded in the FRMMA and WMPMA, which the Utility expects will besubstantial.
OIR Regarding Microgrids
As previously disclosed, on September 19, 2019, 
the CPUC initiated a rulemaking proceeding to examine microgrid implementation issues and resiliency strategiespursuant to SB 1339. In the first tra
ck of that proceeding, the CPUC sought to deploy resiliency planning in areas that are prone to outage events and wildfires,with the stated goal of putt
ing some microgrid and other resiliency strategies in place by spring or summer 2020, if not sooner. At the CPUC’s direction, the Utilitysubmitted a proposal for i
mmediate implementation of resiliency strategies on January 21, 2020. The Utility’s proposal contained three components for which itsought scope and cost recovery au
thorization of up to approximately $379 million in both expense and capital. On April 1, 2020, the Utility filed a motion seekingto supplement its origina
l proposal and to reduce the total cost recovery authorization it was seeking to approximately $257 million. The Utility described in itssupplemental testimony 
that it was focusing in 2020 on the use of temporary, mobile generation solutions to power microgrids in 2020, and that the Utility hadsuspended its solicitation 
for permanent generation located at substations with online dates in 2020. The Utility subsequently closed its solicitation for thispermanent generation. On Apri
l 13, 2020, the ALJ presiding over the rulemaking issued a ruling denying the Utility’s motion to supplement its proposal.The CPUC adopted a decision in the first 
track of the proceeding on June 11, 2020 (the “Track 1 Decision”), which approved with conditions the Utility’s proposaland requires the Utility 
to track costs in a new memorandum account for subsequent regulatory review and recovery in rates.The CPUC initiated the second track o
f the proceeding on July 3, 2020, which focused on further implementation of SB 1339, as well as activity to shape thetransition from diese
l mobile generation to alternative, cleaner backup power generation. On January 14, 2021, the CPUC adopted a final decision in the secondtrack of the proceeding 
(the “Track 2 Decision”). The Track 2 Decision requires the Utility to submit an Advice Letter to justify the amount of temporarygeneration necessary fo
r use at substations during the 2021 wildfire season; to identify at least one clean substation project to pilot the use of diesel generationalternatives to power subst
ation-level microgrids; to file an application by June 30, 2021 to propose a longer-term framework for substation generation solutions tomitigate PSPS outage events; and to 
file an application by September 30, 2021 to recover the costs incurred in 2020 associated with the use of temporarygeneration to mitiga
te PSPS outages. The Track 2 Decision also authorizes the Utility to record the future costs of temporary generation for substations in amemorandum account, with r
ecovery of those costs through the general rate case or a separate application. The costs for the clean substation project(s) areauthorized to be recove
red through a one-way balancing account established by the Track 2 Decision, up to a $350 million cap and subject to other eligibilityrequirements.
In addition, the Track 2 Decis
ion requires that the Utility: (1) modify its existing electric rules to allow certain critical facilities to be powered during grid outagesby adjacent premises; (2) e
stablish a new tariff to facilitate the commercialization and development of single-customer, single-account microgrids; (3) develop anew microgrid incentive p
rogram that compliments the Utility’s existing Community Microgrid Enablement Program and expands the incentives available forcertain eligible 
community microgrids up to a statewide combined budget of $200 million; and (4) create a new process and associated criteria to evaluatetechnologies to isolate 
customer electrical loads for the purpose of forming microgrids during grid outages. The Track 2 Decision establishes an agenda forongoing meetings of the CPUC’s Resiliency and M
icrogrids Working Group.On February 9, 2020, the CPUC issued an amended scoping memo 
initiating Track 3 of the proceeding. In Track 3, the CPUC intends to address whether utilities,including the Utility, should waiv
e standby charges for a customer operating a microgrid under certain circumstances. Further, the CPUC states that in a futureTrack 4 of the proceedi
ng, it intends to address: (1) multi-property microgrid tariffs and alternatives; (2) methodologies to value resiliency; (3) microgridinterconnection issues; 
and (4) revisit its initial determinations with regard to a single-property microgrid tariff.Failure to obtain a substant
ial or full recovery of costs could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity and c
ash flows.OII to Consider PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Plan of Reorganization
As previously disclosed, on October 4, 2019, the CPUC issued an OII 
to consider the ratemaking and other implications “that will result from the confirmation of aplan of reorganization 
and other regulatory approvals necessary to resolve” the Chapter 11 Cases (the “Chapter 11 Proceedings OII”).93

On May 28, 2020, the CPUC approved a final decision in this proceeding. As previously disclosed, the decision approved the Plan with certain conditions andmodifications related to certain t
opics, including but not limited to, governance, operational structure, safety performance, executive competition, and financialcondition. On September 17, 2020, the CPUC issued a proposed de
cision that would close the proceeding. On October 22, 2020, the CPUC approved the decision.Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process
In the Chapter 11 Proceedings OII f
inal decision, the CPUC adopted an Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process designed to provide a roadmap for how theCPUC will monitor the Utility’s perfo
rmance on an ongoing basis. The Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process contains six steps that are triggered byspecific events and inc
ludes enhanced reporting requirements and additional monitoring and oversight. These trigger events include failure to obtain an approvedWMP, failure to comply with r
egulatory reporting requirements, insufficient progress toward approved safety or risk-driven investments and failure to comply withor demonstrate suffic
ient progress toward certain metrics (some of which will be determined in an ongoing regulatory proceeding). The Enhanced Oversight andEnforcement Process also con
tains provisions for the Utility to cure and permanently exit the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process if it can satisfyspecific criter
ia. If the Utility is placed into the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process, actions taken would occur in coordination with the CPUC’s existingformal and informal 
reporting requirements and procedures. The Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process does not replace or limit the CPUC’s regulatoryauthority, including the au
thority to issue Orders to Show Cause and Orders Instituting Investigations and to impose fines and penalties. The Enhanced Oversightand Enforcement Process requ
ires the Utility to report the occurrence of a triggering event to the CPUC’s Executive Director no later than five business days afterthe date on which any member o
f senior management of the Utility becomes aware of the occurrence of a triggering event.On November 24, 2020, the Utility rece
ived a letter from the President of the CPUC, expressing concerns related to the Utility’s vegetation and asset managementactivities and expla
ining potential implications with respect to the CPUC’s Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process, as well as the Utility’s annual safetycertification unde
r California AB 1054. According to the Letter, the President of the CPUC has “directed CPUC staff to conduct fact-finding to determine whethera recommendation to pl
ace [the Utility] into the enhanced oversight and enforcement process is warranted.”The Utility is unable to pred
ict whether additional fines, penalties, or other regulatory actions may be taken.Regionalization Proposal
On June 30, 2020, the Utility filed its 
application for approval of its Regionalization Proposal with the CPUC. The Utility’s proposal would divide its service areainto five new regions to furth
er improve safety and reliability, core operations, and be more responsive to the needs of its customers. The Utility’s RegionalizationProposal describes the develop
ment of these regions, plans to hire new regional leadership, and a new regional organization structure. The Utility’s applicationrequests the CPUC to approve a memorandu
m account to record any incremental costs the Utility incurs in connection with the development and implementationof regionalization. The Ut
ility will file an updated Regionalization Proposal with the CPUC on February 26, 2021.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing and outcome of this application.Wildfire Fund Non-Bypassable Charge
In response to directives 
in AB 1054, on July 26, 2019, the CPUC opened a new rulemaking to consider the authorization of an NBC to support the Wildfire Fund.On October 24, 2019, the CPUC issued a final decision f
inding that the imposition of the NBC is just and reasonable. In addition, the decision affirmed that theUtility and its customers wi
ll not pay an allocated share of the adopted wildfire charge revenue requirement unless and until the Utility participates in the WildfireFund. The decision also continues the s
ame allocation of the wildfire charge revenue requirement among the IOUs as previously adopted for the Department ofWater Resources power and bond cha
rge revenue requirements. The decision proposes revenue requirements for the Utility of $404.6 million, which is based onaverage annual colle
ctions and shall expire at the end of the year 2035.On November 25, 2019, an individual interv
enor filed an application for rehearing of the decision arguing that the decision constitutes a constitutional violation ofprocedural due process and an un
just and unreasonable rate increase. On March 2, 2020, the CPUC issued a decision denying the application for rehearing.94

On July 16, 2020, the CPUC approved the Wildfire Fund NBC servicing orders between the California Department of Water Resources and the Large ElectricalCorporations to impose the Wi
ldfire Fund NBC. On September 10, 2020, the CPUC ordered the Utility to cease collection of the DWR Bond Charge relatedrevenue requirement from electric cu
stomers in their respective territories. The final month in which a Bond Charge related revenue requirement was imposed tocollect revenue from electric customer
s of the Utilities was September 2020.On September 24, 2020, the CPUC ordered the Utility 
to collect the Wildfire Fund NBC from eligible customers from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020in the amount of $0.00580 per kilowat
t-hour.On September 29, 2020, the Utility submi
tted an advice letter to submit tariffs incorporating final rates that was effective October 1, 2020. In addition tosubmitting tariff r
evisions that include final rates as outlined, the letter included the tariff revisions needed to cease the imposition of the DWR Bond Charge andimplement the Wild
fire Fund Charge.On December 17, 2020, the CPUC approved the Utility to 
collect the Wildfire Fund NBC from eligible customers from January 1, 2021 through December 31,2021 in the amount of $0.00580 per kilowat
t-hour. On December 30, 2020, the Utility submitted an advice letter to submit tariffs incorporating final rates effectiveJanuary 1, 2021. The advice lett
er is still pending CPUC approval.On February 22, 2021, the CPUC issued a proposed decision rega
rding the amount of the Wildfire Non-Bypassable Charge in 2022 and 2023. The prehearingconference and scoping me
mo are expected to take place in April, 2021.Transportation Electrification
As previously disclosed, on May 31, 2018, pursuant to 
a state law authorizing the Utility to conduct programs to support and incent the deployment of electricvehicles, the CPUC issued a final dec
ision approving the Utility’s two-to-five year program proposals for actual expenditures up to approximately $269 million(including $198 million of c
apital expenditures), to support utility-owned make-ready infrastructure supporting public fast charging and medium to heavy-dutyfleets.
On February 3, 2020, in a rulemaking to cons
ider further utility-sponsored programs to support electric vehicles and transportation electrification, the CPUC issueda draft Transportation E
lectrification Framework for review and comment. The CPUC held workshops on the draft framework in 2020, and approval of theframework and guidance for 
future electric vehicle programs is expected in 2021.Also in 2020, the California Legisl
ature passed, and the Governor signed, a new law that authorizes the Utility and other California IOUs to invest in new electricdistribution infrastructure t
o support electric vehicles without requiring electric vehicle customers to pay certain of the infrastructure costs that other customers arerequired to pay for n
on-electric vehicle infrastructure costs. Instead, the incremental electric vehicle infrastructure costs will be paid by the Utility’s electriccustomers as common utilit
y costs in the Utility’s periodic general rate cases.OIR to Establish Policies, Processes, and Rules to Ensure Safe and Reliable Gas Systems 
in California and Perform Long-Term Gas PlanningOn January 16, 2020, the CPUC opened an OIR to address reliabi
lity and standards for gas public utilities, the regulatory changes necessary to improve thecoordination between gas uti
lities and gas-fired electric generators, and impacts due to legislative mandates to address the GHG reduction emissions which willresult in the replacement of 
gas-fuel technologies and forecast reduced demand for natural gas. This proceeding will examine whether recent industry relatedevents will require the CPUC to change 
the rules, processes and regulations governing gas utilities, including but not limited to, gas reliability standards, long-termcontracting, regulato
ry accounting, reporting and tariff changes for operational flow orders.95

The Utility filed opening comments on the preliminary scope on February 26, 2020 and reply comments on March 12, 2020. The assigned ALJ and assignedcommissioner held a preh
earing conference on March 24, 2020. The Utility filed a post-prehearing conference statement on April 1, 2020. On April 23, 2020, theassigned commissioner issued 
a ruling setting the final scope, schedule and categorization for phase 1 (Tracks 1A and 1B). On July 7, the CPUC held a workshopto address natural gas re
liability standards (Track 1A) and on July 21, 2020 a second workshop was held to address market structure and regulations (Track 1B).On October 2, 2020, the assigned ALJ issued a ruling, 
including the workshop report and staff recommendations. The Utility filed opening comments on the reporton November 2, 2020 and filed reply co
mments on November 17, 2020. As directed in the October 2, 2020 ruling, the Utility held a workshop on November 30,2020 to address intraday demand 
and grid reliability. On December 24, 2020, the ALJ issued a ruling that modified the schedule. The Utility filed its proposal toaddress gas supply and cost alloc
ation issues described in the workshop report on January 8, 2021. Parties filed comments on January 29, 2021 and reply commentson February 12, 2021.
OIR to Consider Strategies and Guidance for Climate Change Adaptation
On April 26, 2018, the CPUC opened an OIR to consider strategi
es for integrating climate change adaptation matters into relevant CPUC proceedings.On October 24, 2019, the CPUC adopted a final decision on 
a portion of phase one (Topic 1 and 2), defining climate change adaptation for California’s energyutilities as “adjust
ment in natural and human systems to a new or changing environment. Adaptation to climate change for energy utilities regulated by the CPUCrefers to adjustment in utilit
y systems using strategic and data-driven consideration of actual or expected climatic impacts and stimuli or their effects on utilityplanning, facilities maintenance
 and construction, and communications, to maintain safe, reliable, affordable and resilient operations.” In addition, this decisionprovides guidance on what data should b
e used by the IOUs to perform all climate impact, climate risk, and climate vulnerability analyses undertaken with respectto their infrastructure assets
, operations, and customer impacts. Finally, this decision requires the energy utilities to adhere to the same climate scenarios andprojections used in the most 
recent California Statewide Climate Change Assessment when analyzing climate impacts, climate risk, and climate vulnerability ofutility systems, operat
ions, and customers.On October 22, 2019, the CPUC issued a staff proposal for 
a framework for climate-related decision-making and accountability. In the staff proposal, the CPUCinstructed each of the 
large IOUs to research and develop a new form of risk assessment, a CVA. CVAs instruct utilities to “examine the risks posed by climatechange to their core l
ines of business, including generation, transmission, distribution, and storage, irrespective of who owns the assets.” In addition, the staffproposal provides guidance reg
arding the data sources to be used in the CVA, outreach and coordination with the community, and incorporation of CVA findingsinto RAMP and GRC filings. The Utility provided opening and 
reply comments on February 18, 2020 and March 3, 2020, respectively.On August 27, 2020, the CPUC adopted a final decision on Topics 4 and 5, 
regarding adaptation outreach to disadvantaged communities and detailed requirementsfor each IOU’s CVA. The CPUC instructed each IOU to establ
ish a “climate change team,” with cross-departmental responsibilities, which will report directly to adesignated executive a
t the SVP level or above. Each IOU must disclose to the CPUC such changes in organizational structure, listing the individual names anddepartment titles o
f all internal participants. Board members should oversee and prioritize climate adaptation planning, as informed by senior leadership. Each IOUis required to consider c
limate risks to assets, operations, and services over which IOUs have direct control. Additionally, the decision directs the IOUs to seek toobtain an acknowledgement in n
ew contracts with third party providers that the operator has considered long-term climate risk. Each IOUs’ completed CVA willcoincide with its RAMP filing during i
ts four-year GRC cycle, and each IOU must detail resulting climate adaptation measures in a new chapter in its future GRCapplications. Each IOU must fi
le a Community Engagement Plan detailing community outreach on climate adaptation, covering every disadvantaged vulnerablecommunity and leveraging 
existing IOU community outreach on other matters. The IOUs’ climate adaptation Community Engagement Plan proposals must befiled one year prior to 
their CVA, with the Utility’s first Community Engagement Plan due in June 2023, as the Utility’s first CVA under this decision will be duein June 2024. A new memorandum account, th
e Climate Adaptation Vulnerability Assessment Memorandum Account, was authorized to cover CVA costs andincremental costs of outreach.
OIR to Examine Electric Utility De-energ
ization of Power Lines in Dangerous ConditionsOn December 13, 2018, the CPUC opened an OIR to examine the no
tification, mitigation, and reporting requirements on electric utilities when de-energizingpower lines in case of dangerous 
conditions that threaten life or property in California.96

On May 30, 2019, the CPUC approved a decision for phase one of this proceeding, which adopted de-energization communication and notification guidelines forthe electric IOUs along with upd
ates to requirements established in Resolution ESRB-8.On January 30, 2020, the CPUC proposed new guidelines in phase two of th
is proceeding. On May 28, 2020, the CPUC adopted PSPS Phase 2 Guidelines, whichrequire utilities 
to restore energy within 24 hours after the end of a PSPS event where possible; to consult with critical facilities on back-up power for PSPS events;and to support access and funct
ional needs populations during PSPS events, including powering medical equipment at customer resource centers.On August 24, 2020, the ALJ issued a decision addressing two jo
int motions that had been filed in the proceeding. The first motion filed on April 13, 2020requested emergency pro
tocols during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second motion filed on June 15, 2020 requested that the CPUC perform a reasonablenessreview of past IOU PSPS events to determine whe
ther each was reasonable. The August 24, 2020 decision found that, with respect to the first joint motion, theMay 28, 2020 decision dealt with many o
f the issues raised; and with respect to the second joint motion, the CPUC already performed reasonableness reviews ofIOU PSPS events.
On December 2, 2020, the Utility and oth
er parties submitted comments in this proceeding in response to an August 3, 2020 scoping ruling regarding SED’s reportin a separate PSPS-related pro
ceeding, OII to Examine the Late 2019 Public Safety Power Shutoff Events. In their comments, the Utility and other partiescommented that issues r
aised in SED’s report should be addressed in a rulemaking setting. The Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of thisproceeding.
On November 12, 2019, the assigned commission
er and ALJ issued an order to show cause directing the Utility to show why it should not be sanctioned forviolations of law or CPUC decisions rela
ted to the PSPS events of October 9-12, 2019, October 23-25, 2019, and October 26-November 1, 2019.The Utility submitted its 
testimony with the CPUC on February 5, 2020. Other parties submitted their testimony on February 28, 2020, and the Utility submitted itsconcurrent rebuttal 
testimony on April 7, 2020. On September 21, 2020, the assigned commissioner and the ALJ issued an order that required the Utility to respondto certain factua
l questions and concluded that with the provision of responsive answers to those questions, evidentiary hearings would not be needed in theproceeding. Opening briefs were 
filed on October 30, 2020, by all parties, which included an intervenor proposing financial penalties against the Utility of $166million. If adopted by the CPUC, such penal
ties could have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,liquidity, and cash flows. Reply bri
efs were filed by all parties on November 17, 2020, including the Utility, which opposed the imposition of any penalties.On February 19, 2021, the CPUC proposed new guidelines in Phase 3 of this p
roceeding. If adopted, these guidelines would require utilities to submit annual pre-and post- season reports, have c
ertain percentages of Community Resource Centers be indoors, have a webpage that explains “critical facility” requirements, andconduct de-energizat
ion simulation exercises. Parties will comment in March 2021, and a proposed decision is expected in May 2021, with a final decision in June2021.
The Utility is unable to pred
ict the outcome of this proceeding.OII to Examine the Late 2019 Public Safety Power Shutoff Events
On November 13, 2019, the CPUC issued an OII to determine 
“whether California’s IOUs prioritized safety and complied with the CPUC’s regulations andrequirements with respe
ct to their PSPS events in late 2019.” The first phase of this proceeding focuses on (1) the effectiveness of the utility’s procedures to notifythe public of the PSPS events, (2) the ut
ility’s communication and coordination with first responders, local jurisdictions and state agencies, and (3) the utility’smanagement of its resou
rces to ensure public safety. In later phases of this proceeding, the CPUC may consider taking action if it finds violations of statutes or itsdecisions or general orde
rs have been committed and to enforce compliance, if necessary.97

On June 8, 2020, the SED issued a public report on the Late 2019 Public Safety Power Shutoff Events. The report identified certain shortcomings in each of theelectric IOUs’ imple
mentation of the CPUC’s PSPS Guidelines during their late 2019 PSPS events but stated that its findings were intended to be advisory innature, subject to modif
ication, and not intended to serve as an adjudicatory staff investigatory pre-enforcement report. On August 3, 2020, the assignedcommissioner issued a rul
ing and scoping memo directing parties to file comments on SED’s report and the following two issues: (1) whether the Utility and otherIOUs in October and November 2019 complied wi
th the criteria set forth in applicable laws and regulations when pro-actively deenergizing and re-energizing theirpower lines, and (2) what corre
ctive actions the CPUC should require of the Utility and other IOUs for any failure in late 2019 to comply with the then-existingPSPS guidelines. Each of the IOUs filed thei
r comments on September 2, 2020, intervenors filed their comments on October 16, 2020, and reply comments werefiled by all parties on Nove
mber 16, 2020. Several parties proposed in their comments that penalties be imposed on the utilities for inadequate implementation ofthe PSPS events. For example, TURN proposed that the CPUC should treat 
each customer affected by a PSPS event, for which the IOU has not adequatelydemonstrated that the b
enefits outweigh the public safety risks, as a separate offense, with each offense subject to a penalty of no less than $500 and no more than$100,000. In reply comments, the Uti
lity argued that the proposed penalties should not be adopted for procedural and substantive reasons. If adopted by the CPUC,such penalties could be expe
cted to have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cashflows.
The proposed decision is expect
ed in the first quarter of 2021, and the CPUC’s final decision is anticipated no sooner than 30 days after the proposed decision. TheUtility is unable to predi
ct the outcome of this proceeding.Power Charge Indifference Adjustment OIR
In 2017, the CPUC initiated the PCIA Rulemaking to m
ake refinements to the PCIA, a cost recovery mechanism to ensure that customers that leave the Utility’sbundled service for a non-Uti
lity provider, such as a DA or CCA provider, pay their fair share of the above market costs associated with long-term power purchasecommitments and Utili
ty-owned generation made on their behalf. The above market costs of the Utility’s generation portfolio are calculated using benchmarks forenergy, RA and RPS attributes.
As previously disclosed, on October 11, 2018, the CPUC approved a ph
ase one decision to modify the PCIA methodology. The Utility implemented a revisedPCIA reflecting this decision 
in rates as of July 1, 2019.Also, as previously disclosed, on October 10, 2019, 
the CPUC approved a final decision that finalized the true-up for the new PCIA methodology.On March 26, 2020, the CPUC approved a final decision on d
eparting load forecasting and PCIA bill presentation issues, establishing that the IOUs shall show aPCIA line item in their ta
riffs and bill summary tables on all customer bills, which shall be implemented by the last business day of 2021.On June 30, 2020, the CPUC issued a PD that would provide a non-Utility prov
ider an option to prepay their entire PCIA obligation. On August 6, 2020 the CPUCissued a final decision adop
ting a framework for prepayment agreements for PCIA obligations.The proceeding is now examining st
ructures and rules governing how the Utility addresses excess resources in its portfolio due to load loss to CCA and DA,including standards for ac
tive management of the Utility’s portfolios. On December 16, 2020, the assigned commissioner issued an amended scoping memo andruling expanding the rulem
aking’s scope to include the potential modification of the annual PCIA rate cap and potential changes to the Utility’s cost recovery andrate setting proceed
ings to improve PCIA and ERRA alignment.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the outcome of this proceeding.98

Central Procurement of the Resource Adequacy ProgramOn June 17, 2020, the CPUC issued a decision on the Central Procu
rement of the RA program. The decision shifts local RA procurement responsibility under theCPUC’s RA program from all load serving ent
ities to a CPE in two distribution service areas, including the Utility’s distribution service area, resulting in a changefrom decentralized to centralized local
 RA procurement in those distribution service areas. The decision also adopted implementation details for the centralprocurement of multi
-year local RA, ordered the Utility and another IOU to serve as the CPE for their respective distribution service areas, and adopted a hybridcentral procuremen
t framework for the multi-year local RA program beginning for the 2023 RA compliance year.The decision requires the Ut
ility, as the CPE for its distribution service area, to conduct a competitive, all-source solicitation for local RA procurement, with anyexisting local resourc
e that does not have a contract, any new local resource that can be brought online in time to meet solicitation requirements, or any loadserving entity or third-p
arty with an existing local RA contract eligible to bid into the solicitation.Subsequently, on December 3, 2020, the CPUC issued a follow-up d
ecision adopting a compensation mechanism applicable to certain local resources that may beprocured by the CPE for purposes of reduc
ing the total CPE procurement requirements. This mechanism applies to new preferred local resources and new localenergy storage resources, 
including utility-owned generation. Procurement by the Utility of, and compensation for, such resources shall occur outside of thecompetitive, all-sou
rce solicitation.The Cost Allocation Mechanism m
ethodology is adopted as the cost recovery mechanism to cover procurement costs incurred in serving the central procurementfunction. The administra
tive costs incurred in serving the central procurement entity function shall also be recoverable under the Cost Allocation Mechanism.Integrated Resource Planning Procurement
On November 13, 2019, the CPUC issued a decision that tak
es a number of steps to address the potential for system RA shortages beginning in 2021. The decisionrequires increment
al procurement of system-level qualifying RA capacity of 3,300 MWs by all LSEs operating within the CAISO’s balancing area for the period2021-2023, of which the Utility is respons
ible for 716.9 MWs for its bundled customer portion. The decision requires that at least 50% of LSE resourceresponsibilities come on
line by August 1, 2021, at least 75% by August 1, 2022, and the remaining by August 1, 2023. Additionally, the decision directs the IOUsto act as the backstop procu
rement agent for CCAs and Energy Service Providers (ESPs) that choose not to voluntarily self-procure or that fail to meet theirprocurement responsibil
ities after electing to self-provide their assigned MWs of system RA capacity under the decision. On April 15, 2020, the ALJ issued aruling that the Utility 
must procure 48.2 MWs of RA capacity for LSEs that chose to opt-out of voluntarily self-providing their required portion.The Utility has procured its 
required RA capacity for the August 1, 2021 milestone from third parties through CPUC-approved contracts for lithium ion batteryenergy storage resources wi
th terms ranging from 10-15 years. On December 22, 2020, the Utility filed an advice letter seeking CPUC approval of an additionalgroup of similar contra
cts that would satisfy the balance of the Utility’s procurement obligations for the August 1, 2022 and August 1, 2023 milestones.The CPUC is developing a Modified Cost Allocation M
echanism methodology, under which the Utility will be able to recover procurement and administrativecosts it incurs in serving th
e backstop procurement function.OIR to Further Develop a Risk-Based Decision-Making Framework for Electric and Gas Utili
tiesOn July 20, 2020, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking p
roceeding to consider ways to strengthen the risk-based decision-making framework that regulated energyutilities use to assess, m
anage, mitigate and minimize safety risks. The rulemaking will build on requirements for a utility risk framework adopted in the firstSafety Model Assessment Proceeding. Th
e CPUC’s goal is to further the prioritization of safety by electric and gas utilities.On November 2, 2020, the assigned commission
er issued a scoping memo establishing the scope, schedule, and categorization for Phase I and Phase II of theproceeding. Phase I, which began Novembe
r 2020, will consider (i) clarifications to the technical requirements of the risk-based decision-making framework; (ii)safety and operational p
erformance metrics; and (iii) refining RAMP procedural requirements.99

On November 17, 2020, the assigned commissioner issued a ruling regarding the development of safety and operational metrics for the Utility. The ruling directedthe Utility to propose met
rics that are “suitable for the use as triggering events as specified in the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process” and “suitable,over time, for the Commiss
ion, intervenors, and the public to potentially use to gauge the safety and operational performance of all gas and electric IOUs.” OnJanuary 15, 2021, the Utility fil
ed a response proposing 12 safety and operational metrics using the criteria outlined by the ruling. On January 25, 2021, partiesfiled responses to the Util
ity’s proposal. On January 28, 2021, the CPUC hosted a public workshop where the Utility, the other IOUs, and intervenors commentedon the Utility’s safety and op
erational metrics proposal. All parties may file comments on the Utility’s safety and operational metrics by March 1, 2021.OIR to Revisit Net Energy Metering Tariffs
On August 17, 2020, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking pro
ceeding to develop a successor to the existing NEM tariffs. The successor tariff is being developedpursuant to the requirem
ents of AB 327. Under AB 327, the successor to the existing NEM tariffs should provide customer-generators with credit or compensationfor electricity generated by their
 renewable facilities based on the value of that generation to all customers and allows customer-sited renewable generation to growsustainably among differ
ent types of customers.On November 19, 2020, the assigned commission
er and the ALJ issued a scoping memo and ruling for this proceeding. The scoping memo separated theproceeding into two phases. In the 
first phase, the CPUC will address several issues including, but not limited to, determining the principles to assist in thedevelopment and evaluat
ion of a successor to the current NEM tariffs, assessing what information from a study on existing tariffs should inform the successor,outlining the methods to use to 
analyze the program elements and the resulting proposals, and determining the program elements or specific features that should beincluded in the successor t
ariff. In the second phase, the CPUC will consider what additional or enhanced consumer protections for customers should be adopted,as well as other issues that 
may arise, such as the virtual net energy metering tariffs, NEM aggregation tariff, the Renewable Energy Self-Generation Bill CreditTransfer program, and the NEM fu
el cell tariff.On January 5, 2021, the ALJ issued a PD that outlined e
ight guiding principles to assist in the development and evaluation of proposals for successor to the currentNEM tariff. The Utility fi
led comments on January 25, 2021, and reply comments on February 1, 2021. On February 11, 2021, the CPUC issued a final decision onthe guiding principles.
OIR to Address Energy Utility Customer Debt Accumulated during the Coronavirus Pandemic
On February 11, 2021, the CPUC initiated a rulem
aking proceeding to consider arrearage relief for utility customers who will have outstanding utility bills whenthe moratorium on servi
ce disconnections ends. The OIR will evaluate a more global program beyond the currently approved arrearage management programfocused on low-income residen
tial customers that is funded by the Utility’s customers. The OIR may consider various funding approaches for this expanded debtforgiveness proposal, which could in
clude shareholder funding.The CPUC has indicated that it expec
ts to issue a proposed decision on May 21, 2021 and a final decision on June 24, 2021.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the outcome of this proceeding.100

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVESSenate Bill 350
On June 30, 2020, the California governor sign
ed into law SB 350 (the Golden State Energy Act), a bill which authorizes the creation by the governor of a newentity “Golden State Energy,” 
a nonprofit public benefit corporation, for the purpose of acquiring the Utility’s assets and serving electric and gas in the Utility’sservice territory on
ly in the event that the CPUC determines that the Utility’s Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity should be revoked pursuant to anyprocess or procedures adopted by 
the CPUC in its decision approving PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Plan of Reorganization.Senate Bill 901
SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requir
es the CPUC to establish a CHT, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in the aggregate, so thatthey do not exceed the CHT. SB 901 also authoriz
es the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (alsoreferred to as “secu
ritization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, anyamounts in excess of the CHT.
Assembly Bill 1054
On July 12, 2019, the California governor sign
ed into law AB 1054, a bill which provides for the establishment of a statewide fund that will be available foreligible electric utility companies t
o pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12, 2019 that are caused by the applicable electricutility company’s equipm
ent, subject to the terms and conditions of AB 1054. Eligible claims are claims for third party damages resulting from any such wildfires,limited to the portion o
f such claims that exceeds the greater of (i) $1.0 billion in the aggregate in any year and (ii) the amount of insurance coverage required to bein place for the ele
ctric utility company pursuant to section 3293 of the Public Utilities Code, added by AB 1054.AB 1054 also provides that the first $5.0 b
illion expended in the aggregate by California’s three IOU companies on fire risk mitigation capital expendituresincluded in their respe
ctive approved WMPs will be excluded from their respective equity rate bases. The $5.0 billion of capital expenditures will be allocatedamong the IOU companies in acco
rdance with their Wildfire Fund allocation metrics. (See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8.) AB 1054 contemplates that such c
apital expenditures may be securitized through a customer charge. On February 24, 2021, the Utility filed an application withthe CPUC seeking authorization for a 
transaction to securitize up to a principal amount of approximately $1.19 billion related to fire risk mitigation capitalexpenditures that have be
en or will be incurred by the Utility in 2020 and 2021.Each of California’s la
rge IOUs have elected to participate in the Wildfire Fund. On July 1, 2020, having satisfied the conditions for the Utility’s participation inthe Wildfire Fund, the Util
ity deposited approximately $5 billion in the Wildfire Fund, which represents PG&E’s initial and first annual contributions. OnDecember 30, 2020, the Utility m
ade its second annual contribution of $193 million to the Wildfire Fund.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health ofthe Utility’s personnel and 
the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardouswastes; the reporting and r
eduction of carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting of safety andreliability measu
res for natural gas storage facilities; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors,“Environmental Regulation
” in Item 1. and “Environmental Remediation Contingencies” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8.)
RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
PG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownersh
ip of the Utility, and the Utility are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interestrates, and counterparty 
credit. The Utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourageunauthorized risk-taking, 
reduce commodity cost volatility, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non-trading purposes (i.e.,risk mitigation) and not 
for speculative purposes.101

Commodity Price RiskThe Utility is exposed to commod
ity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas andnuclear fuel necessary for electricit
y generation and natural gas procurement for core customers. The Utility’s risk management activities include the use ofphysical and financial 
instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps, options, and other instruments and agreements. As long as the Utility can concludethat it is probable that it
s reasonably incurred wholesale electricity procurement costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and naturalgas prices will not affe
ct earnings. Such fluctuations, however, may impact cash flows. The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core customersare also fully recoverable thr
ough a ratemaking mechanism.The Utility’s current au
thorized revenue requirement for natural gas transportation and storage service to non-core customers is not balancing account protected. The Utility recovers thes
e costs in its gas transmission and storage rate cases through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts,resulting in price and volu
metric risk. The Utility uses value-at-risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks. The Utility’s value-at-risk wasapproximately $14 mill
ion and $9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements inItem 8. for further dis
cussion of price risk management activities.)Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk s
ensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in marketinterest rates. At Dece
mber 31, 2020 and 2019, if interest rates changed by one percent for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term debt, short-term debt, and cash invest
ments, the impact on net income over the next 12 months would be $89 million and $45 million, respectively, based on net variable ratedebt and other interest 
rate-sensitive instruments outstanding. (See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. for further discussion ofinterest rates.)
Energy Procurement Credit Risk
The Utility conducts business with coun
terparties mainly in the energy industry to purchase electricity or gas and related services, including the CAISO market,other California IOUs, municip
al utilities, energy trading companies, pipelines, financial institutions, electricity generation companies, and oil and natural gasproduction companies loca
ted in the United States and Canada. If a counterparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas andrelated services, then the 
Utility may find it necessary to procure electricity or gas at current market prices or seek alternate services, which may be higher than thecontract prices.
The Utility manages cred
it risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, creditratings, and other credit
 criteria as deemed appropriate. Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically. The Utility executes many energy contractsunder master commodity ena
bling agreements that may require security. Security may be in the form of cash or letters of credit. The Utility may accept other formsof performance assurance in
 the form of corporate guarantees of acceptable credit quality or other eligible securities (as deemed appropriate by the Utility).Security or performance as
surance may be required from the Utility or counterparties when current net receivables/payables and exposure exceed contractuallyspecified limits.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe preparation of the Consolid
ated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recordedamounts of assets and liabi
lities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Theaccounting policies desc
ribed below are considered to be critical accounting policies due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant andmaterial to the f
inancial position and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the use of material judgmentsand estimates. Actual res
ults may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. These accounting policies and their key characteristics are outlinedbelow.
Contributions to the Wildfire Fund
On the Effective Date, PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility contributed, in accordance with AB 1054, an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and firstannual contribution of approx
imately $193 million to the Wildfire Fund to secure participation of the Utility therein. On December 30, 2020, the Utility made itssecond annual contribution of $193 
million to the Wildfire Fund. As of December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have eight remaining annualcontributions of $193 million. PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility account for the contributions to the Wildfire Fund similarly to prepaid insurance with expensebeing allocated to per
iods ratably based on an estimated period of coverage. The Wildfire Fund is available to pay for eligible claims arising as of July 12, 2019,the effective dat
e of AB 1054, subject to a limit of 40% of the amount of such claims arising between the effective date of AB 1054 and the Utility’s emergencefrom Chapter 11. The 40% limi
t does not apply to eligible claims that arise after the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11. The Wildfire Fund is additionallylimited to the portion o
f such claims that exceeds the greater of (i) $1.0 billion in the aggregate in any year and (ii) the amount of insurance coverage required to bein place for the ele
ctric utility company pursuant to Section 3293 of the Public Utilities Code, added by AB 1054.As of December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity recorded $193 million in Other current liabilities, $1.3 billion in Other non-current liabilities,$464 million in current ass
ets - Wildfire fund asset, and $5.8 billion in non-current assets - Wildfire fund asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As ofDecember 31, 2020, the Utility r
ecorded amortization and accretion expense of $413 million. The amortization of the asset, accretion of the liability, and ifapplicable, impair
ment of the asset is reflected in Wildfire fund expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Expected contributions are discounted to thepresent value using the 10-ye
ar US treasury rate at the date PG&E Corporation and the Utility satisfied all the eligibility requirements to participate in the WildfireFund. A useful life of 15 years is being us
ed to amortize the Wildfire Fund asset.AB 1054 did not specify a period of cover
age; therefore, this accounting treatment is subject to significant accounting judgments and estimates. In estimating theperiod of coverage, PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility use a Monte Carlo simulation that began with 12 years of historical, publicly available fire-loss data fromwildfires caused by elec
trical equipment, and subsequently plan to add an additional year of data each following year. The period of historic fire-loss data and theeffectiveness of mitigation effort
s by the California electric utility companies are significant assumptions used to estimate the useful life. These assumptions alongwith the other assumptions below c
reate a high degree of uncertainty related to the estimated useful life of the Wildfire Fund. The simulation results in theestimated number and severit
y of catastrophic fires that could occur in California within the participating electric utilities’ service territories during the term of theWildfire Fund. Starting with a 5
-year period of historical data, with average annual statewide claims or settlements of approximately $6.5 billion, compared toapproximately $2.9 billion 
for the 12-year historical data, would have decreased the amortization period to 6 years. Similarly, a 10% change to the assumptionaround current and fut
ure mitigation effort effectiveness would increase the amortization period to 17 years assuming greater effectiveness and would decrease theamortization period 
to 12 years assuming less effectiveness.Other assumptions 
used to estimate the useful life include the estimated cost of wildfires caused by other electric utilities, the amount at which wildfire claimswould be settled, the likely 
adjudication of the CPUC in cases of electric utility-caused wildfires, the impacts of climate change, the level of future insurancecoverage held by the ele
ctric utilities, the FERC-allocable portion of loss recovery, and the future transmission and distribution equity rate base growth of otherelectric utilities. Significant cha
nges in any of these estimates could materially impact the amortization period.103

PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate all assumptions quarterly, or upon claims being made from the Wildfire Fund for catastrophic wildfires, and theexpected life of the 
Wildfire Fund will be adjusted as required. The Wildfire Fund is available to other participating utilities in California and the amount of claimsthat a participat
ing utility incurs is not limited to their individual contribution amounts. PG&E Corporation and the Utility will assess the Wildfire Fund asset forimpairment in the event that a
 participating utility's electrical equipment is found to be the substantial cause of a catastrophic wildfire. Timing of any suchimpairment could lag as the
 emergence of sufficient cause and claims information can take many quarters and could be limited to public disclosure of theparticipating electric utility, if ig
nition were to occur outside the Utility’s service territory. There were fires in the Utility’s and other participating utilities’ serviceterritories in 2020 for whi
ch the cause is currently unknown and which may in the future be determined to be covered by the Wildfire Fund. At December 31,2020, there were no such known events requi
ring a reduction of the Wildfire Fund asset nor have there been any claims or withdrawals by the participating utilitiesagainst the Wildfir
e Fund.Loss Contingencies
As discussed below, PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty have recorded material accruals for various wildfire-related, enforcement and legal matters, andenvironmental remediation liabilities
. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded insurance receivables for third-party claims.Wildfire-Related Liabilities
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to potential liabilities related to wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a wildfire-related liability whenit determines that 
a loss is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of losses. The provision is based on the lower end of the range, unless anamount within the range is a b
etter estimate than any other amount.Potential liabilit
ies related to wildfires depend on various factors, including but not limited to negotiations and settlements or the cause of each fire, contributingcauses of the fires (in
cluding alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed, thecontents of such structures 
and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants, the nature andextent of any personal inju
ries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs, other damagesthe Utility may be responsib
le for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities. There are a number ofunknown facts and legal consider
ations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be assertedagainst PG&E Corporation or the Util
ity. For example, the Utility’s wildfire-related accruals have changed in the past as new facts and information becameavailable to the Util
ity, including the availability of new evidence and additional information about the scope and nature of damages. (See Note 14 of the Notes tothe Consolidated Financial Sta
tements in Item 8.)The process for estimatin
g wildfire-related liabilities requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjectivefactors, including but not l
imited to factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires.  (See Note14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan
cial Statements in Item 8.)Enforcement and Litigation Matters
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims andlawsuits. In addition, penalt
ies may be incurred for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility record aprovision for a loss contingency when 
it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. PG&E Corporationand the Utility evaluat
e the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is abetter estimate 
than any other amount. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable,often involves a series of 
complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of allknown information, such as negotia
tions, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to aparticular matt
er. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs, which are expensed as incurred. Actualresults may differ m
aterially from these estimates and assumptions. (See Note 14 and “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 15 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.)104

Environmental Remediation LiabilitiesThe Utility is subject to loss 
contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the Utility to payfor environmental re
mediation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party. Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardoussubstances at various potent
ial sites, including former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility for thestorage, recycling, or dispos
al of potentially hazardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site.The Utility generally comme
nces the environmental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a potentialsite requiring remedial action.
 (In some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determine its remediation liability for sites that it no longer owns in cooperationwith regulatory agencies. For 
example, the Utility has a program related to certain former manufactured gas plant sites.) Based on such notification, the Utilitycompletes an assessment 
of the potential site and evaluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred. The Utility records anenvironmental remed
iation liability when site assessments indicate remediation is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of possible losses.Given the complexities of 
the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process forestimating remedi
ation liabilities is subjective and requires significant judgment. Key factors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extent and types ofhazardous substances at a pot
ential site, the range of technologies that can be used for remediation, the determination of the Utility’s liability in proportion to otherresponsible parties, and th
e extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.When possible, the Utility es
timates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites depending onthe level of informa
tion available. Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees who areexpected to devote a si
gnificant amount of time directly to the remediation effort. These estimated costs include remedial site investigations, remediation actions,operations and maintenance
 activities, post remediation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site.Remediation efforts fo
r a particular site generally extend over a period of several years. During this period, the laws governing the remediation process maychange, as well as site condi
tions, thereby possibly affecting the cost of the remediation effort.At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Utility
’s accruals for undiscounted gross environmental liabilities were $1.3 billion. The Utility’s undiscounted future costscould increase to as much 
as $2.2 billion if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or if the other potentially responsibleparties are not finan
cially able to contribute to these costs, and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyond regulatory requirements. Althoughthe Utility has provided for known env
ironmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, estimated costs may vary significantly from actual costs,and the amount of additiona
l future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.Insurance Receivable
The Utility has liabili
ty insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party claims. The Utility records insurance recoveries only when athird-party claim 
is recorded and it is deemed probable that a recovery of that claim will occur and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.  Theassessment of whether recov
ery is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the recovery or a range of recoveries is estimable, often involves a series ofcomplex judgments abo
ut future events.  Insurance recoveries are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information,including contractual 
liability insurance policy coverage, advice of legal counsel, past experience with similar events, discussions with insurers and otherinformation and events pe
rtaining to a particular matter. (See “Loss Recoveries” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)Regulatory Accounting
As a regulated entity, the Ut
ility records regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers. Despitethe ongoing losses related to wi
ldfires (See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.), there is no actual or anticipated change in thecost of service regula
tion of the Utility’s operations. Therefore, the Utility continues to apply the accounting ASC 980, Regulated Operations . These amounts would otherwise be recorded to exp
ense or income under GAAP. Refer to “Regulation and Regulated Operations” in Note 3 as well as Note 4 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8. At December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reported regulatory assets (including current regulatorybalancing accounts rec
eivable) of $11.4 billion and regulatory liabilities (including current regulatory balancing accounts payable) of $12.0 billion.105

Determining probability requires significant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatoryhearings, proposed regulatory d
ecisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. For some of theUtility’s regulatory asset
s, including utility retained generation, the Utility has determined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from theCPUC. The Utility also records a regula
tory asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that recovery ofincurred costs is probable, su
ch as the regulatory assets for pension benefits; deferred income tax; price risk management; and unamortized loss, net of gain, onreacquired debt. The CPUC has not denied th
e recovery of any material costs previously recognized by the Utility as regulatory assets for the periods presented. Ifthe Utility determin
ed that it is no longer probable that regulatory assets would be recovered or reflected in future rates, or if the Utility ceased to be subject to rateregulation, the regula
tory assets would be charged against income in the period in which that determination was made. If regulatory accounting did not apply, theUtility’s future financial res
ults could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the differences in the timing of expense or revenuerecognition.
A portion of the Utility's regul
atory asset balances relate to items which could not be anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests resulting fromcatastrophic events, ch
anges in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in amemorandum account and th
e CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incremental and prudentlyincurred. These accounts, which 
include the CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and RTBA among others, allow the Utility to trackthe costs associated with work r
elated to disaster and wildfire response, and other wildfire prevention-related costs. In addition, the CPPMA account tracks costsincurred to implemen
t the CPUC’s Emergency Authorization and Order Directing Utilities to Implement Emergency Customer Protections to Support CaliforniaCustomers During the COVID-19 Pandemic. While 
the Utility believes such costs are recoverable, rate recovery requires CPUC authorization in separateproceedings or through a GRC. (For more info
rmation, see “Regulatory Matters - Application for Recovery of Costs Recorded in the Wildfire ExpenseMemorandum Account,” “Regulato
ry Matters - Catastrophic Event Memorandum Accounts and Applications,” “Regulatory Matters - Wildfire MitigationMemorandum and Balancing Accounts,
” and “Regulatory Matters - COVID-19 Pandemic Protections Memorandum Account.”)Additionally, SB 901 provides a mechanis
m for the CPUC to potentially allow recovery in future rates, through a securitization mechanism, of wildfire-relatedcosts found to be just and reasonab
le by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the CHT. The Utility mustevaluate the likelihood of
 recovery in future rates each period. If the criteria are met at a later date, the Utility would recognize a regulatory asset and a related gainin the consolidated incom
e statement in the period in which it is determined that the likelihood of recovery is probable.In addition, regulatory a
ccounting standards require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemakingpurposes and if a reasonable 
estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments require significant judgment by management regardingprobability of recovery, 
as described above, and the ultimate cost of construction of capital assets. The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are expectedto exceed the amount to be 
recovered.  The Utility’s capital forecasts involve a series of complex judgments regarding detailed project plans, estimates included inthird-party contracts, hist
orical cost experience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmental compliance standards, and a variety of other factors. Asset Retirement Obligations
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ac
count for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair valueand its settlement da
te can be made. At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of therelated long-lived ass
et. The Utility recognizes a regulatory asset or liability for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs recoveredthrough the ratemaking pro
cess. (See Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)To estimate its liab
ility, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant estimates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs,inflation rates, and the e
stimated date of decommissioning. The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the riskassociated with the decom
missioning obligation.At December 31, 2020, the Utility’s 
recorded ARO for the estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was approximately $6.4 billion. Changes in theseestimates and assumptions 
could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.106

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit PlansPG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non
-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees as well as contributory postretirement healthcare and medical plans for eli
gible retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees andretirees. Adjustments to 
the pension and other benefit obligation are based on the differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results. These amountsare deferred in ac
cumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into income on a gradual basis. The differences between pension benefit expenserecognized in accordan
ce with GAAP and amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities as amounts are probable ofrecovery from custome
rs. To the extent the other benefits are in an overfunded position, the Utility records a regulatory liability. (See Note 4 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.)The pension and 
other postretirement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date. The significant actuarialassumptions used in determin
ing pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the health carecost trend rate and the 
expected return on plan assets. PG&E Corporation and the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.While PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience, plan changes oramendments, or significant
 changes in assumptions may materially affect the recorded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future planexpenses. (See Note 12 of the Notes to th
e Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)In establishing health c
are cost assumptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider recent cost trends and projections from industry experts. This evaluationsuggests that current ra
tes of inflation are expected to continue in the near term. In recognition of continued high inflation in health care costs and given the designof PG&E Corporation’s plans, the assumed h
ealth care cost trend rate for 2020 was 6.3%, gradually decreasing to the ultimate trend rate of approximately 4.5% in2028 and beyond.
Expected rates of retu
rn on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations ofthe employee benefit p
lan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets. Returns on fixed-income debt investments were projected based onreal maturity and c
redit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate. Returns on equity investments were projected based on estimates of dividend yield and realearnings growth added to a long-t
erm inflation rate. For the Utility’s defined benefit pension plan, the assumed return of 5.1% compares to a ten-year actual returnof 9.6%.
The rate used to discount pension b
enefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of approximately 835 Aa-grade non-callablebonds at December 31, 2020. This yield cu
rve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations. The estimated future cash flows for the pensionand other postretirem
ent benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.The following reflects th

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PR
ESENTATIONOrganization and Basis of Presentation
PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose pri
mary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and centralCalifornia. The Utility gen
erates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers. The Utility is primarily regulated by theCPUC and the FERC. In addition, the NRC oversees the licensing, cons
truction, operation, and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.This is a combined annual repo
rt of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of PG&ECorporation, the Utility, and oth
er wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries. The Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Utilityand its wholly owned and controlled subsid
iaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements apply to both PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess financial performance and allocate resources on aconsolidated basis (i.e., th
e companies operate in one segment).The accompanying Consolidated Finan
cial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the reporting requirements of Form10-K. The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,liabilities, revenu
es and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to theUtility’s regulatory asset
s and liabilities, wildfire-related liabilities, legal and regulatory contingencies, the Wildfire Fund, environmental remediation liabilities,AROs, insurance receivables, and pens
ion and other post-retirement benefit plan obligations. Management believes that its estimates and assumptions reflected inthe Consolidated Financial Sta
tements are appropriate and reasonable. A change in management’s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment thatwould have a material i
mpact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows during the period inwhich such change occurred.
Chapter 11 Filing and Going Concern
The accompanying Consolidated Finan
cial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of operations, therealization of asse
ts and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. PG&E Corporation and the Utility suffered material losses as a result of the2017 Northern California wildfi
res and the 2018 Camp fire, which contributed to the decision to file for Chapter 11 protection on January 29, 2019. Uncertaintyregarding these matt
ers previously raised substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s abilities to continue as going concerns.As a result of PG&E Corporation’s and the Ut
ility’s emergence from Chapter 11 on the Effective Date of July 1, 2020, substantial doubt has been alleviatedregarding the Company’s abil
ity to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date the financial statements were issued. (For moreinformation regarding 
the Chapter 11 Cases, see Note 2 below.)NOTE 2: BANKRUPTCY FILING
Chapter 11 Proceedings
On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility commenced the Chapter 11 Cases with the Bankruptcy Court. Prior to the Effective Date, PG&ECorporation and the Utility con
tinued to operate their business as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with theapplicable provisions of th
e Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.Except as otherwise set for
th in the Plan, the Confirmation Order or another order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially all pre-petition liabilities were dischargedunder the Plan.

rred $53 million in professional fees related to the Subrogation RSA. See “Restructuring Support Agreement with Holdersof Subrogation Claims” in Note 14 for 
further information on the Subrogation RSA.On December 6, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity entered the TCC RSA, which was subsequently amended on December 16, 2019, with the TCC, theattorneys and other advisors

ansactions occurred on or around the Effective Date.On the Effective Date, pursuan
t to the Plan, the Utility entered into a tax benefits payment agreement (the “Tax Benefits Payment Agreement”) with the FireVictim Trust, pursuant to which th
e Utility agreed to pay to the Fire Victim Trust in cash an aggregate amount of $1.35 billion, comprising (i) at least $650 millionof tax benefits arising

rgence from Chapter 11 in July 2020, PG&E raised an aggregate of $9.0 billion of gross proceeds through the issuance of common stockand other equity-linked ins
truments. For more information, see Note 6 below.126

Equity Backstop Commitments and Forward Stock Purchase AgreementsAs of March 6, 2020, PG&E Corporation entered in
to Chapter 11 Plan Backstop Commitment Letters (collectively, as amended by the Consent Agreements (asdefined below), the “Backstop Comm
itment Letters”) with the Backstop Parties, pursuant to which the Backstop Parties severally agreed to fund up to $12.0 billionof proceeds to finance th
e Plan through the purchase of PG&E Corporation common stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in such BackstopCommitment Letters (
the “Backstop Commitments”). As a result of PG&E Corporation emerging from Chapter 11 on July 1, 2020, the Backstop Commitmentswere not utilized and te
rminated in accordance with their terms.The commitment prem
ium for the Backstop Commitments was paid in shares (the “Backstop Commitment Premium Shares”) of PG&E Corporation’s commonstock (with each Backstop Party r
eceiving its pro rata share of 119 million shares of PG&E Corporation’s common stock based on the proportion of the amount ofsuch Backstop Party’s Backstop Commitm
ent to $12.0 billion). PG&E Corporation issued the Backstop Commitment Premium Shares to the Backstop Parties onthe Effective Date in 
connection with emerging from Chapter 11.On June 30, 2020, PG&E Corporation recorded approxim
ately $1.1 billion of expense related to the Backstop Commitment Premium Shares in Reorganizationitems, net (as defined b
elow). This amount was primarily based on PG&E Corporation’s closing stock price on June 30, 2020 of $8.87 per share. On the EffectiveDate, PG&E Corporation’s closing pric
e was $9.03 per share and as a result, PG&E Corporation recorded an additional $19 million expense in the third quarter of2020.
Under the Backstop Commitment Le
tters, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also agreed to reimburse the Backstop Parties for reasonable professional feesand expenses of up to $34 million in 
the aggregate for the legal advisors and $19 million in the aggregate for the financial advisor, upon the terms and conditionsset forth in the Backstop Commi
tment Letters. As of December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation recorded $49 million in professional fees and related expenses to theBackstop Parties in Reorganiza
tion items, net.In connection with PG&E Corporation’s unde
rwritten offerings of up to $5.75 billion of equity securities to finance the transactions contemplated by the Plan (the“Offerings”), up to $523 mill
ion was issuable pursuant to customary options granted to the underwriters thereof to purchase the Option Securities (as definedbelow in Note 6).
On June 19, 2020, PG&E Corporation entered into the Forwa
rd Stock Purchase Agreements with the Backstop Parties. Each Forward Stock Purchase Agreementprovided that, subject to c
ertain conditions, the Backstop Party would purchase on the Effective Date, and receive on such settlement date as designated in theForward Stock Purchase Agreement (th
e “Settlement Date”) an amount of common stock of PG&E Corporation (such shares, each Backstop Party’s “GreenshoeBackstop Shares”) equal to its p
ro rata share of the value of the Option Securities not purchased by the underwriters (such amount, each Backstop Party’s“Greenshoe Backstop Purchase Amount” and 
all Greenshoe Backstop Purchase Amounts in the aggregate, the “Aggregate Greenshoe Backstop PurchaseAmount”), at a price per sh
are equal to the lesser of (i) the lowest per share price of common stock sold on an underwritten basis to the public in an offering ofcommon stock of PG&E Corporation, as disc
losed on the cover page of the prospectus or prospectus supplement, and (ii) the price per share payable by theinvestors party to the Inves
tment Agreement dated as of June 7, 2020 (such lesser price, the “Settlement Price”). The Settlement Price was $9.50 per share. EachForward Stock Purchase Agreement expi
red on August 3, 2020.On June 25, 2020, the Backstop Parties funded the Gr
eenshoe Backstop Purchase Amount to PG&E Corporation in the amount of $523 million, which wasrecorded in Other curren
t liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements. PG&E Corporation applied the proceeds of such funding to distributions under thePlan on the Effective Date. On August 3, 2020, PG&E Corpora
tion redeemed $120.5 million of the Forward Stock Purchase Agreements payable in cash as a resultof the exercise by the unde
rwriters of their option to purchase Equity Units pursuant to the Equity Units Underwriting Agreement (as defined below in Note 6). OnAugust 3, 2020, PG&E Corporation delivered 42.3 mil
lion Greenshoe Backstop Shares to the Backstop Parties to settle the portion of the Forward Stock PurchaseAgreements that was not rede
emed.Additionally, each Forward Stock Purchas
e Agreement provided that, subject to the consummation by PG&E Corporation of the Offerings, PG&E Corporationwould issue to each Backstop Party its p
ro rata share of 50 million shares of common stock (such shares, each Backstop Party’s “Additional Backstop PremiumShares”). The Additional Backstop Pre
mium Shares were issued to Backstop Parties on the Effective Date. On June 30, 2020, PG&E Corporation recorded$444 million of expense rel
ated to the Additional Backstop Premium Shares in Reorganization items, net. This amount was based primarily on PG&ECorporation’s closing stock pri
ce on June 30, 2020 of $8.87 per share. On the Effective Date, PG&E Corporation’s closing stock price was $9.03 per share and as aresult, PG&E Corporation recorded 
an additional $8 million expense in the third quarter of 2020.127

Financial Reporting in ReorganizationEffective on the Petit
ion Date and up to June 30, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility applied accounting standards applicable to reorganizations, which areapplicable to compani
es under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. These accounting standards require the financial statements for periods subsequent to the PetitionDate to distinguish transac
tions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Expenses, realizedgains and losses, and provisions for loss
es that were directly associated with reorganization proceedings must have been reported separately as reorganizationitems, net in the Consolidat
ed Statements of Income. In addition, the balance sheet must have distinguished pre-petition LSTC of PG&E Corporation and theUtility from pre-pet
ition liabilities that were not subject to compromise, post-petition liabilities, and liabilities of the subsidiaries of PG&E Corporation that werenot debtors in the Chapter 11 Cases in 
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. LSTC are pre-petition obligations that were not fully secured and had at least a possibilityof not being repaid at the 
full claim amount. Where there was uncertainty about whether a secured claim would be paid or impaired pursuant to the Chapter 11Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility c
lassified the entire amount of the claim as LSTC.Furthermore, the real
ization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. Pursuant to the Plan and Confirmation Order, actions to enforce orotherwise effect the p
ayment of certain claims against PG&E Corporation and the Utility in existence before the Petition Date were subject to an injunction andwere subject to treat
ment under the Plan. These claims were reflected as LSTC in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2019. Additional claims mayarise for contingenci
es and other unliquidated and disputed amounts.PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Financia
l Statements are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of PG&E Corporation and the Utility andother subsidiaries of PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility that individually and in aggregate are immaterial. Such other subsidiaries did not file for bankruptcy.The Utility’s Consolidated Financ
ial Statements are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of the Utility and other subsidiaries of the Utilitythat individually and in agg
regate are immaterial. Such other subsidiaries did not file for bankruptcy.Upon emergence from Chapter 11 on Ju
ly 1, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility were not required to apply fresh start accounting based on the provisions ofASC 852 since the entity’s reorgani
zation value immediately before the date of confirmation was more than the total of all its post-petition liabilities and allowedclaims.
Liabilities Subject to Compromise
As a result of the commenc
ement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the payment of pre-petition liabilities was subject to compromise or other treatment pursuant to thePlan. Generally, actions to en
force or otherwise effect payment of pre-petition liabilities are subject to an injunction and will be satisfied pursuant to the Plan andthe Chapter 11 claims re
conciliation process.Prior to June 30, 2020, pre-petition 
liabilities that were subject to compromise were required to be reported at the amounts expected to be allowed. Therefore,liabilities subjec
t to compromise as of December 31, 2019 in the table below reflected management’s estimates of amounts expected to be allowed in the Chapter11 Cases, based upon, among other things, the s
tatus of negotiations with creditors. As of June 30, 2020, such amounts were reclassified to current or non-currentliabilities in the Condens
ed Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon management’s judgment as to the timing for settlement of such liabilities.128

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
received over 100,000 proofs of claim since the Petition Date, of which approximately 80,000 were channeled to theSubrogation Wildfire Trust 
and Fire Victim Trust. The claims channeled to the Subrogation Wildfire Trust and Fire Victim Trust will be resolved by such trusts,and PG&E Corporation and the Utility hav
e no further liability in connection with such claims. PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue their review andanalysis of certain remaining
 claims including asserted litigation claims, trade creditor claims, non-qualified benefit plan claims, along with other tax andregulatory claims, and theref
ore the ultimate liability of PG&E Corporation or the Utility for such claims may differ from the amounts asserted in such claims.Allowed claims are paid in 
accordance with the Plan and the Confirmation Order.The Bankruptcy Code provides that the 
confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation, otherthan as provided in the Plan or th
e Confirmation Order.The Plan, however, provides that the ho
lders of certain claims may pursue their claims against PG&E Corporation and the Utility on or after the Effective Date,including, but not limited 
to, the following:•
claims arising after the January 29, 2019 Petition Date that constitute administrative expense claims, which will not be discharged pursuant to the Plan,other than allowed adminis
trative expense claims that have been paid in cash or otherwise satisfied in the ordinary course in an amount equal to theallowed amount of such clai
m on or prior to the Effective Date;•
claims of the Ghost Ship fire litigation (with any recovery being limited to amounts available under PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s insurancepolicies for the 2016 year
);•
claims arising out of or based on the 2019 Kincade fire (as defined in Note 14 below), which the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protectionhas determined was caused by th
e Utility’s transmission lines; which is currently under investigation by the CPUC and the Sonoma County DistrictAttorney’s Office; and which m

Furthermore, holders of certain claims may assert that they are entitled under the Plan or the Bankruptcy Code to pursue, or continue to pursue, their claims againstPG&E Corporation and the Utility on or a
fter the Effective Date, including but not limited to, claims arising from or relating to:•
the purported de-energization securities class action filed in October 2019 and amended to add PG&E Corporation in April 2020. For more informationon the filing, see Note 14 below;
•
the purported PSPS class action filed in December 2019 and seeking up to $2.5 billion in special and general damages, punitive and exemplary damagesand injunctive relie

ters, in connection with three purported securities class actions, as further described in Note 14 under the heading “Securities Class ActionLitigation.”
Various electricity supp
liers filed claims in the Utility’s 2001 prior proceeding filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking payment for energysupplied to the Utility’s cus
tomers between May 2000 and June 2001. While FERC and judicial proceedings are pending, the Utility pursued settlements withelectricity suppli
ers and entered into a number of settlement agreements with various electricity suppliers to resolve some of these disputed claims and to resolvethe Utility’s refund cl
aims against these electricity suppliers. Under these settlement agreements, amounts payable by the parties, in some instances, would besubject to adjustment bas
ed on the outcome of the various refund offset and interest issues being considered by the FERC. Generally, any net refunds, claimoffsets, or other credi
ts that the Utility receives from electricity suppliers either through settlement or through the conclusion of the various FERC and judicialproceedings are refunded 
to customers through rates in future periods. Pursuant to the Plan, on and after the Effective Date, the holders of such claims are entitledto pursue their claims 
against the Reorganized Utility as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced.On September 1, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court requesting that the court approve an alternative disputeresolution process for reso
lving disputed general unsecured claims and appoint a panel of mediators in the process. On September 25, 2020, the court approved themotion and appointed a panel o
f mediators. The mediators’ role will be to assist various claims through a Standard and Abbreviated Mediation Process.On October 27, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed a motion for entry of an order extending deadline for the reorganized debtors to object to claims,requesting an additional 180 d
ays beyond December 31, 2020 to process claims. On November 17, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order extending thedeadline under the Plan for PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility to object to claims through and including June 26, 2021 (March 31, 2021, for claims held by theUnited States), without prejudi
ce to the rights of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to seek additional extensions thereof.130

TING POLICIESRegulation and Regulated Operations
The Utility follows
 accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorizedby the CPUC or the FERC based on the Utility’s cost of provid
ing service.  The Utility’s ability to recover a significant portion of its authorized revenuerequirements through ra
tes is generally independent, or “decoupled,” from the volume of the Utility’s electricity and natural gas sales.  The Utility records assetsand liabilities tha
t result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities.  The Utility capitalizes andrecords, as regulatory ass
ets, costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.  Regulatoryassets are amortiz
ed over the future periods in which the costs are recovered.  If costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered throughrates, the Utility re
cords those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities.  Amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers in the future arealso recorded as regula
tory liabilities.The Utility also record
s a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that areprobable of recovery or r
efund.  In addition, the Utility records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between incurred costs and customerbillings or authorized r
evenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differences are probable of recovery or refund.  These differences have noimpact on net income.  See 
“Revenue Recognition” below.Management continues to be
lieve the use of regulatory accounting is applicable and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable.  To theextent that portions of th
e Utility’s operations cease to be subject to cost of service rate regulation, or recovery is no longer probable as a result of changes inregulation or other re
asons, the related regulatory assets and liabilities are written off. (1)(2)

Loss ContingenciesA provision for a loss contingency is 
recorded when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can reasonably beestimated. PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility evaluate which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonably estimated losses and record acharge that refle
cts their best estimate or the lower end of the range, if there is no better estimate. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonablypossible, and whether the loss or a 
range of losses is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewedquarterly and estima
tes are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice oflegal counsel, and other in
formation and events pertaining to a particular matter. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludesanticipated legal 
costs, which are expensed as incurred.Revenue Recognition
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Utility recognizes r
evenues when electricity and natural gas services are delivered.  The Utility records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energydelivered to customers bu
t not yet billed at the end of the period.  Unbilled revenues are included in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Ratescharged to customers ar
e based on CPUC and FERC authorized revenue requirements. Revenues can vary significantly from period to period because ofseasonality, weather, and cus
tomer usage patterns.Regulatory Balancing Account Revenue
The CPUC authorizes most of the Utility
’s revenues in the Utility’s GRC and GT&S rate cases, which generally occur every three or four years.  The Utility'sability to recover r
evenue requirements authorized by the CPUC in these rate cases is independent or “decoupled” from the volume of the Utility's sales ofelectricity and natural gas ser
vices. The Utility recognizes revenues that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable ofrecovery, and are expec
ted to be collected within 24 months.  Generally, electric and natural gas operating revenue is recognized ratably over the year. The Utilityrecords a balancing accou
nt asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that are probable of recovery orrefund.
The CPUC also has authorized the Utility 
to collect additional revenue requirements to recover costs that the Utility has been authorized to pass on to customers,including costs to purchase e
lectricity and natural gas, and to fund public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs.  In general, therevenue recognition cr
iteria for pass-through costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred. The Utility records a regulatory balancing accountasset or liability fo
r differences between incurred costs and customer billings or authorized revenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differencesare probable of recove
ry or refund. As a result, these differences have no impact on net income.132

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents consist o
f cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated atfair value.  As of December 31, 2020, 
the Utility also holds restricted cash that primarily consists of cash held in escrow to be used to pay bankruptcy relatedprofessional fees.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable and Credit Losses
PG&E Corporatio
n and the Utility recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts to record uncollectible customer accounts receivable at estimated net realizablevalue.  The allowance is det
ermined based upon a variety of factors, including historical write-off experience, aging of receivables, current economic conditions,and assessment of customer 
collectability.In addition, upon adopting ASU 2016-13, PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility use the current expected credit loss model to estimate the expected lifetime credit losson financial assets, incl
uding trade and other receivables, rather than incurred losses over the remaining life of most financial assets measured at amortized cost.The guidance also requires us
e of an allowance to record estimated credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities. See “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses”below for more informat
ion.Inventories
Inventories are car
ried at weighted-average cost and include natural gas stored underground as well as materials and supplies.  Natural gas stored underground isrecorded to inventory when inj
ected and then expensed as the gas is withdrawn for distribution to customers or to be used as fuel for electric generation.  Materialsand supplies are recorded 
to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when consumed or installed.(1)(2)

Emission AllowancesThe Utility purchases GHG emission al
lowances to satisfy its compliance obligations.  Associated costs are recorded as inventory and included in current assets –other and other noncurrent 
assets – other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Costs are carried at weighted-average and are recoverable through rates.Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment 
are reported at the lower of their historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value.  Historical costs include labor andmaterials, construc
tion overhead, and AFUDC.  (See “AFUDC” below.)  The Utility’s total estimated useful lives and balances of its property, plant, andequipment were as follows:

it is used based on the amount of energyoutput.  (See Note 15 below.)
The Utility depreciat
es property, plant, and equipment using the composite, or group, method of depreciation, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to thegross investment balance 
in a particular class of property.  This method approximates the straight-line method of depreciation over the useful lives of property,plant, and equipment.  The Util
ity’s composite depreciation rates were 3.76% in 2020, 3.80% in 2019, and 3.82% in 2018.  The useful lives of the Utility’sproperty, plant, and equipmen
t are authorized by the CPUC and the FERC, and the depreciation expense is recovered through rates charged to customers. Depreciation expense inc
ludes a component for the original cost of assets and a component for estimated cost of future removal, net of any salvage value atretirement.  Upon reti
rement, the original cost of the retired assets, net of salvage value, is charged against accumulated depreciation.  The cost of repairs andmaintenance, including pla
nned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of property, is charged to operating and maintenance expense as incurred.AFUDC
AFUDC represents the estimated costs o
f debt (i.e., interest) and equity funds used to finance regulated plant additions before they go into service and iscapitalized as par
t of the cost of construction.  AFUDC is recoverable from customers through rates over the life of the related property once the property is placedin service.  AFUDC related to the cost o
f debt is recorded as a reduction to interest expense.  AFUDC related to the cost of equity is recorded in other income.  TheUtility recorded AFUDC related to deb
t and equity, respectively, of $35 million and $140 million during 2020, $55 million and $79 million during 2019, and$53 million and $129 million dur
ing 2018. (1)(1)

Asset Retirement ObligationsThe following table summar
izes the changes in ARO liability during 2020 and 2019, including nuclear decommissioning obligations:(in millions)
2020 2019 ARO liability at beginning of year

flows53 (376) Accretion
265 274 Liabilities settled
(28) (38) ARO liability at end of year
$ 6,412  $5,854  The Utility has not recorded 
a liability related to certain AROs for assets that are expected to operate in perpetuity.  As the Utility cannot estimate a settlement dateor range of potential se
ttlement dates for these assets, reasonable estimates of fair value cannot be made.  As such, ARO liabilities are not recorded for retirementactivities associated with 
substations, certain hydroelectric facilities; removal of lead-based paint in some facilities and certain communications equipment fromleased property; and res
toration of land to the conditions under certain agreements. Nuclear Decommissioning Obligation
Detailed studies of the cos
t to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities are generally conducted every three years in conjunction with the NuclearDecommissioning Cost Triennial Pro
ceeding conducted by the CPUC.  The decommissioning cost estimates are based on the plant location and cost characteristicsfor the Utility's nuclea
r power plants.  Actual decommissioning costs may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such asdecommissioning dates; r
egulatory requirements; technology; and costs of labor, materials, and equipment.  The Utility recovers its revenue requirements fordecommissioning costs from 
customers through a non-bypassable charge that the Utility expects will continue until those costs are fully recovered.The total nuclear deco
mmissioning obligation accrued was $5.1 billion and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The estimated undiscountednuclear decommissioning 
cost for the Utility’s nuclear power plants was $10.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019.Disallowance of Plant Costs
PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently completed plant will not berecoverable through ra
tes charged to customers and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts
The Utility’s nuclear gen
eration facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and one retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires thesafe removal of a nuclear ge
neration facility from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license andrelease of the proper
ty for unrestricted use.  The Utility's nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered from customers through rates and are held in trusts untilauthorized for rele
ase by the CPUC. The Utility classifies 
its debt investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts as available-for-sale. Since the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning trust assetsare managed by externa
l investment managers, the Utility does not have the ability to sell its investments at its discretion.  Therefore, all unrealized losses areconsidered other-than-temporar
y impairments. Gains or losses on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments are refundable or recoverable, respectively, fromcustomers through rates.  The
refore, trust earnings are deferred and included in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of the ARO.  There is no impact onthe Utility’s earnings or 
accumulated other comprehensive income.  The cost of debt and equity securities sold by the trust is determined by specific identification.135

Variable Interest EntitiesA VIE is an entity that does not have su
fficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or whoseequity investors lack a
ny characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is a primary beneficiaryand is required to consolida
te the VIE.  Consolidated VIE
The SPV is a bankruptcy remote, lim
ited liability company wholly owned by the Utility, and its assets are not available to creditors of PG&E Corporation or theUtility. Pursuant to the Receiv
ables Securitization Program (as defined in Note 5 below), the Utility sells certain of its receivables and certain related rights topayment and obligations of th
e Utility with respect to such receivables, and certain other related rights to the SPV, which, in turn, obtains loans secured by thereceivables from f
inancial institutions (the “Lenders”). Amounts received from the Lenders, the pledged receivables and the corresponding debt are included inAccounts receivable and Long-
term debt, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The aggregate principal amount of the loans made by the Lenderscannot exceed $1.0 billion outs
tanding at any time. The Receivables Securitization Program is scheduled to terminate on October 5, 2022, unless extended orearlier terminated.
The SPV is considered a VIE because its equ
ity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. The most significant activities that impact the economicperformance of the SPV are de
cisions made to manage receivables. The Utility is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates the SPV as it makes thesedecisions. No additional finan
cial support was provided to the SPV during the year ended December 31, 2020 or is expected to be provided in the future that wasnot previously contractua
lly required. As of December 31, 2020, the SPV has $2.6 billion of net accounts receivable and has outstanding borrowings of $1.0 billionunder the Receivables Secur
itization Program.Non-Consolidated VIEs
Some of the counterparti
es to the Utility’s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power plant that wouldgenerate electr
icity for sale to the Utility.  To determine whether the Utility was the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2020, it assessedwhether it absorbs any of the VIE’s 
expected losses or receives any portion of the VIE’s expected residual returns under the terms of the power purchaseagreement, analyzed 
the variability in the VIE’s gross margin, and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities that are mostsignificant to the VIE’s pe
rformance, such as dispatch rights and operating and maintenance activities.  The Utility’s financial obligation is limited to the amountthe Utility pays for deliv
ered electricity and capacity.  The Utility did not have any decision-making rights associated with any of the activities that are mostsignificant to the econo
mic performance of any of these VIEs.  Since the Utility was not the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2020, it didnot consolidate any of them.
Contributions to the Wildfire Fund
On the Effective Date, PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility contributed, in accordance with AB 1054, an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and firstannual contribution of approx
imately $193 million to the Wildfire Fund to secure participation of the Utility therein. On December 30, 2020, the Utility made itssecond annual contribution of $193 
million to the Wildfire Fund. As of December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have eight remaining annualcontributions of $193 million. PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility account for the contributions to the Wildfire Fund similarly to prepaid insurance with expensebeing allocated to per
iods ratably based on an estimated period of coverage. The Wildfire Fund is available to pay for eligible claims arising as of July 12, 2019,the effective dat
e of AB 1054, subject to a limit of 40% of the amount of such claims arising between the effective date of AB 1054 and the Utility’s emergencefrom Chapter 11. The 40% limi
t does not apply to eligible claims that arise after the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11. The Wildfire Fund is additionallylimited to the portion o
f such claims that exceeds the greater of (i) $1.0 billion in the aggregate in any year and (ii) the amount of insurance coverage required to bein place for the ele
ctric utility company pursuant to Section 3293 of the Public Utilities Code, added by AB 1054.As of December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity recorded $193 million in Other current liabilities, $1.3 billion in Other non-current liabilities,$464 million in current ass
ets - Wildfire fund asset, and $5.8 billion in non-current assets - Wildfire fund asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As ofDecember 31, 2020, the Utility r
ecorded amortization and accretion expense of $413 million. The amortization of the asset, accretion of the liability, and ifapplicable, impair
ment of the asset is reflected in Wildfire fund expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Expected contributions are discounted to thepresent value using the 10-ye
ar US treasury rate at the date PG&E Corporation and the Utility satisfied all the eligibility requirements to participate in the WildfireFund. A useful life of 15 years is being us
ed to amortize the Wildfire Fund asset.136

AB 1054 did not specify a period of coverage; therefore, this accounting treatment is subject to significant accounting judgments and estimates. In estimating theperiod of coverage, PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility use a Monte Carlo simulation that began with 12 years of historical, publicly available fire-loss data fromwildfires caused by elec
trical equipment, and subsequently plan to add an additional year of data each following year. The period of historic fire-loss data and theeffectiveness of mitigation effort
s by the California electric utility companies are significant assumptions used to estimate the useful life. These assumptions alongwith the other assumptions below c
reate a high degree of uncertainty related to the estimated useful life of the Wildfire Fund. The simulation results in theestimated number and severit
y of catastrophic fires that could occur in California within the participating electric utilities’ service territories during the term of theWildfire Fund. Starting with a 5
-year period of historical data, with average annual statewide claims or settlements of approximately $6.5 billion, compared toapproximately $2.9 billion 
for the 12-year historical data, would have decreased the amortization period to 6 years. Similarly, a 10% change to the assumptionaround current and fut
ure mitigation effort effectiveness would increase the amortization period to 17 years assuming greater effectiveness and would decrease theamortization period 
to 12 years assuming less effectiveness.Other assumptions 
used to estimate the useful life include the estimated cost of wildfires caused by other electric utilities, the amount at which wildfire claimswould be settled, the likely 
adjudication of the CPUC in cases of electric utility-caused wildfires, the impacts of climate change, the level of future insurancecoverage held by the ele
ctric utilities, the FERC-allocable portion of loss recovery, and the future transmission and distribution equity rate base growth of otherelectric utilities. Significant cha
nges in any of these estimates could materially impact the amortization period.PG&E Corporation and the Utility eva
luate all assumptions quarterly, or upon claims being made from the Wildfire Fund for catastrophic wildfires, and theexpected life of the 
Wildfire Fund will be adjusted as required. The Wildfire Fund is available to other participating utilities in California and the amount of claimsthat a participat
ing utility incurs is not limited to their individual contribution amounts. PG&E Corporation and the Utility will assess the Wildfire Fund asset forimpairment in the event that a
 participating utility's electrical equipment is found to be the substantial cause of a catastrophic wildfire. Timing of any suchimpairment could lag as the
 emergence of sufficient cause and claims information can take many quarters and could be limited to public disclosure of theparticipating electric utility, if ig
nition were to occur outside the Utility’s service territory. There were fires in the Utility’s and other participating utilities’ serviceterritories in 2020 for whi
ch the cause is currently unknown and which may in the future be determined to be covered by the Wildfire Fund. At December 31,2020, there were no such known events requi
ring a reduction of the Wildfire Fund asset nor have there been any claims or withdrawals by the participating utilitiesagainst the Wildfir
e Fund.Other Accounting Policies

A lease exists when an arrange
ment allows the lessee to control the use of an identified asset for a stated period in exchange for payments. This determination ismade at inception of th
e arrangement. All leases must be recognized as a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet of the lessee. The ROU asset reflectsthe lessee’s right to use 
the underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liability reflects the obligation to make the lease payments. PG&E Corporation and theUtility have elected no
t to separate lease and non-lease components.The Utility estimates 
the ROU assets and lease liabilities at net present value using its incremental secured borrowing rates, unless the implicit discount rate in theleasing arrangement can be a
scertained. The incremental secured borrowing rate is based on observed market data and other information available at the leasecommencement date. Th
e ROU assets and lease liabilities only include the fixed lease payments for arrangements with terms greater than 12 months. Theseamounts are presented with
in the supplemental disclosures of noncash activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Renewal and termination optionsonly impact the lease 
term if it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. PG&E Corporation recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the leaseterm. The Utility recogn
izes lease expense in conformity with ratemaking. (1) (1)

Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Financingleases are included in p
roperty, plant, and equipment, other current liabilities, and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Financing leaseswere immaterial 
for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.For the years ended December 31, 2020 
and 2019, the Utility made total cash payments, including fixed and variable, of $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively,for operating leases which 
are presented within operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The fixed cash payments for the principalportion of the financing l
ease liabilities are immaterial and continue to be included within financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Anyvariable lease paym
ents for financing leases are included in operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.The majority of the Util
ity’s ROU assets and lease liabilities relate to various power purchase agreements. These power purchase agreements primarily consist ofgeneration plants leas
ed to meet customer demand plus applicable reserve margins. Operating lease variable costs include amounts from renewable energy powerpurchase agreements wher
e payments are based on certain contingent external factors such as wind, hydro, solar, biogas, and biomass power generation. See“Third-Party Power Purchase Agreem
ents” in Note 15 below. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded ROU assets and lease liabilities related toproperty and land arrange
ments.At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Utility
’s operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 5.7 years and 5.9 years and a weighted averagediscount rate of 6.2% and 6.2%, r

Intangibles—Goodwill and Other
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, 
Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal - Use So ftware (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting forImplementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement tha
t is a Service Contract. PG&E Corporation and the Utility adopt ed the ASU on January 1,2020. The adoption of this ASU did not have a mat
erial impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.139

Financial Instruments—Credit LossesIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) : Measurement of Credit Losses On Financial Instruments,which provides a model, known as the cur
rent expected credit loss model, to estimate the expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets, including trade and otherreceivables, rathe
r than incurred losses over the remaining life of most financial assets measured at amortized cost. The guidance also requires use of an allowanceto record estimated 
credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities. PG&E Corporation and the Utility adopted the ASU on January 1, 2020.PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
three categories of financial assets in scope, each with their own associated credit risks. In applying the new guidance,PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
incorporated forward-looking data in their estimate of credit loss as follows. Trade receivables are represented by customeraccounts receivable and ha
ve credit exposure risk related to California unemployment rates. Insurance receivables are related to the liability insurance policiesPG&E Corporation and the Utility ca
rry. Insurance receivable risk is related to each insurance carrier’s risk of defaulting on their individual policies. Lastly,available-for-sale debt securities re
quires each company to determine if a decline in fair value is below amortized costs basis, or, impaired. Furthermore, if animpairment exists on av
ailable-for-sale debt securities, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will examine if there is an intent to sell, if it is more likely than not arequirement to sell p
rior to recovery, and if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of credit loss. As of December 31, 2020, expected credit losses of$150 million were recorded 
in Operating and maintenance expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income for credit losses associated with trade and otherreceivables. Of these a
mounts recorded at December 31, 2020, $76 million and $10 million were deemed probable of recovery and deferred to the CPPMA and aFERC regulatory asset, respectiv
ely.Reference Rate Reform
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) : Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on FinancialReporting
, which provides  optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference ratereform on financial 
reporting. PG&E Corporation and the Utility adopted this ASU on April 1, 2020 and elected the optional amendments for contractmodifications prospect
ively. There was no material impact to PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements resulting from the adoptionof this ASU.
Defined Benefit Plans
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, 
Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20): DisclosureFramework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for De
fined Benefit Plans, which amends the existing guidan ce relating to the disclosure requirements fordefined benefit plans. PG&E Corpora
tion and the Utility adopted the ASU as of December 31, 2020. The adoption of ASU 2018-14 resulted in elimination of thedisclosures of (i) the a
mounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the nextfiscal year and (ii) the effects 
of a one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on the (1) aggregate of the service and interest costcomponents of net periodic b
enefit costs and (2) benefit obligation for postretirement health care benefits. Additionally, the adoption of this ASU resulted in newdisclosures of (i) the weigh
ted-average interest crediting rates for cash balance plans and (ii) an explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related tochanges in the benefit obl
igation for the period. These amendments have been applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. See Note 12 below forfurther discussion of PG&E Corporation
’s and the Utility’s defined benefit pension plans.Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted
Income Taxes
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which amends the existing guidance to reduce compl
exity relating to Income Tax disclosures. This ASU became effective for PG&E Corporation and the Utility on January 1, 2021 and willnot have a material 
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related disclosures.140

DebtIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, 
Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470 -20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contractsin Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40
): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, which simplifies the ac counting forcertain financia
l instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. This ASU willbe effective for PG&E Corpora

The General Rate Case Memorandum Accounts record the difference between the gas and electric revenue requirements in effect on January 1, 2020 and through the date of the final 2020GRC decision as authorized by the CPUC in December 2020. These amounts will be recovered in rates over 17 months, beginning March 1, 2021.
The 2020 GRC Decision authorized the Utility to modify the exis
ting one-way VMBA Expense Balancing Account to a two-way balancing account to track the difference between actual andadopted expenses resulting from its routine vegetation management and enhanced vegeta
tion management activities previously recorded in the FRMMA/WMPMA, and tree mortality and firerisk reduction work previously recorded in CEMA. 
Recovery of VMBA costs above 120% of adopted revenue requirements is subject to CPUC review and approval. On April 16, 2020, the CPUC passed a resolution that established the CPPMA to recover costs associated with cus
tomer protections, including higher uncollectible costs related to amoratorium on electric and gas service disconnections for residential and small business cus
tomers. The CPPMA applies only to residential and small business customers and was approvedon July 27, 2020 with an effective date of March 4, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Utility had recorded an aggregate under-collection of 
$76 million , representing incremental bad debt expense over what was collected in rates for the period the CPPMA is in effect. The remaining $8 million is associa
ted with program costs and higher accounts receivable financing costs.Recovery of CPPMA costs is subject to CPUC review and approval.
In general, regulatory 
assets represent the cumulative differences between amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes and expense or accumulated othercomprehensive income (
loss) recognized in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, the Utility does not earn a return on regulatory assets if the related costs do notaccrue interest. Acco
rdingly, the Utility earns a return on its regulatory assets for retained generation, and regulatory assets for unamortized loss, net of gain, onreacquired debt.

The Utility tracks (1) 
differences between the Utility’s authorized revenue requirement and customer billings, and (2) differences between incurred costs andcustomer billings.  To the ex
tent these differences are probable of recovery or refund over the next 12 months, the Utility records a current regulatory balancingaccount receivable o
r payable.  Regulatory balancing accounts that the Utility expects to collect or refund over a period exceeding 12 months are recorded as othernoncurrent assets – regula
tory assets or noncurrent liabilities – regulatory liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These differences do nothave an impact on net inco
me.  Balancing accounts will fluctuate during the year based on seasonal electric and gas usage and the timing of when costs areincurred and customer r

Utility Term Loan Credit FacilityOn July 1, 2020, the Utility obtained a $3.0 bi
llion secured term loan under a term loan credit agreement (the “Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement”) with JPM, asadministrative agen
t. The credit facilities under the Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement consist of a $1.5 billion 364-day term loan facility (the “Utility 364-DayTerm Loan Facility”) and 
a $1.5 billion 18-month term loan facility (the “Utility 18-Month Term Loan Facility”). The maturity date for the 364-Day Term LoanFacility is June 30, 2021 and the ma
turity date for the Utility 18-Month Term Loan Facility is January 1, 2022. The Utility borrowed the entire amount of theUtility 364-Day Term Loan Facil
ity and the Utility 18-Month Term Loan Facility on July 1, 2020. The proceeds were used to fund, in part, transactionscontemplated under the Pl
an.Borrowings under the Utility Term Lo
an Credit Agreement bear interest based on the Utility’s election of either (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 2.00%with respect to the Utili
ty 364-Day Term Loan Facility and 2.25% with respect to the Utility 18-Month Term Loan Facility, or (2) the base rate plus an applicablemargin of 1.00% with respect 
to the Utility 364-Day Term Loan Facility and 1.25% with respect to the Utility 18-Month Term Loan Facility.The Utility’s obligations unde
r the Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement are secured by the issuance of first mortgage bonds, issued pursuant to the Utility’smortgage indenture, secure
d by a first lien on substantially all of the Utility’s real property and certain tangible personal property related to its facilities, subject tocertain exceptions, and whi
ch rank pari passu  with the Utility’s other f irst mortgage bonds.The Utility Term Loan Credit Agr
eement includes usual and customary provisions for term loan agreements of this type, including covenants limiting, with certainexceptions, (1) liens, (2) 
indebtedness, (3) sale and leaseback transactions, (4) fundamental changes, (5) entering into swap agreements and (6) modifications to theUtility’s mortgage inden
ture. In addition, the Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement requires that the Utility maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt toconsolidated capital
ization of no greater than 65% as of the end of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2020, the Utility was in compliance with this covenant.In the event of a defaul
t by the Utility under the Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement, including cross-defaults relating to specified other debt of the Utility or anyof its significant subsidi
aries in excess of $200 million, the administrative agent may, with the consent of the required lenders (or upon the request of the requiredlenders, shall), decla
re the amounts outstanding under the Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement, including all accrued interest, payable immediately. For events ofdefault relating to 
insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, the amounts outstanding under the Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement become payable immediately.The Utility is required to p
repay outstanding term loans under the Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement (with all outstanding term loans made under the Utility364-Day Term Loan Facility being p
aid first), subject to certain exceptions, with 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain securitization transactions. The Utilitymay voluntarily repay outs
tanding loans under the Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary “breakage”costs with respect to eurodol
lar rate loans.Receivables Securitiza
tion ProgramOn October 5, 2020, the Utility, in its ind
ividual capacity and in its capacity as initial servicer, entered into an accounts receivable securitization program (the“Receivables Securiti
zation Program”), providing for the sale of a portion of the Utility's accounts receivable to the SPV, a limited liability company wholly ownedby the Utility. Pursuant to the Rec
eivables Securitization Program, the Utility sells certain of its receivables and certain related rights to payment and obligations ofthe Utility with respect 
to such receivables and certain other related rights to the SPV, which, in turn, obtains loans secured by the receivables from financialinstitutions (the “Lende
rs”). The Utility has pledged to the Lenders 100% of the equity interests in the SPV as security for the repayment of the loans. Theaggregate principal 
amount of the loans made by the Lenders cannot exceed $1.0 billion outstanding at any time.145

The loans under the Receivables Securitization Program bear interest based on a spread over LIBOR dependent on the tranche period thereto and any breakage feesaccrued. The receivab
les financing agreement contains customary LIBOR benchmark replacement language giving the administrative agent, with consent from theSPV as to the successor rate, the r
ight to determine such successor rate.  The Receivables Securitization Program contains certain customary representations andwarranties and affir
mative and negative covenants, including as to the eligibility of the receivables being sold by the Utility and securing the loans made by theLenders, as well as
 customary reserve requirements, Receivables Securitization Program termination events, and servicer defaults. The Receivables SecuritizationProgram termination ev
ents permit the Lenders to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including failure by the SPV to payamounts when due, certain def
aults on indebtedness under the Utility’s credit facility, certain judgments, a change of control, certain events negatively affecting theoverall credit qual
ity of transferred receivables and bankruptcy and insolvency events.The Receivables Securiti
zation Program is scheduled to terminate on October 5, 2022, unless extended or earlier terminated, at which time no further advances willbe available and the obl
igations thereunder must be repaid in full no later than (i) the date that is 180 days following such date or (ii) such earlier date on which theloans under the program beco
me due and payable.In general, the proceeds 
from the sale of the accounts receivable are used by the SPV to pay the purchase price for accounts receivables it acquires from the Utilityand may be used to fund capita
l expenditures, repay borrowings on the Utility Revolving Credit Facility, satisfy maturing debt obligations, as well as fund workingcapital needs and other 
approved uses.Although the SPV is a wholly owned consolidated subsidia
ry of the Utility, the SPV is legally separate from the Utility. The assets of the SPV (including theaccounts receivables
) are not available to creditors of the Utility or PG&E Corporation, and the accounts receivables are not legally assets of the Utility or PG&ECorporation. The Receivables Secu
ritization Program is accounted for as a secured financing. The pledged receivables and the corresponding debt are included inAccounts receivable and Long-
term debt, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.At December 31, 2020 the Utility had ou
tstanding borrowings of $1.0 billion under the Receivables Securitization Program.PG&E Corporation
On July 1, 2020, PG&E Corporation entered into a $500 m
illion revolving credit agreement (the “Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement”) with JPM, asadministrative agen
t and collateral agent. The Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement has a maturity date three years after the Effective Date, subject to two one -year extensions at the opt
ion of PG&E Corporation. The proceeds from the loans under the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement will be used to financeworking capital needs, capi
tal expenditures and other general corporate purposes of PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries.Borrowings under the Corporation Revolving Cred
it Agreement bear interest based on PG&E Corporation’s election of either (1) LIBOR plus an applicablemargin of 3.00% to 4.25% based on PG&E Corporat
ion’s credit rating or (2) the base rate plus an applicable margin of 2.00% to 3.25% based on PG&ECorporation’s credit ra
ting. In addition to interest on outstanding principal under the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement, PG&E Corporation is required topay a commitment fe
e to the lenders in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder, ranging from 0.50% to 0.75% per annum depending on PG&ECorporation’s credit ra
ting.PG&E Corporation’s obligations under th
e Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement are secured by a pledge of PG&E Corporation’s ownership interest in 100%of the shares of common stock o
f the Utility.The Corporation Revolving Credit Agree
ment includes usual and customary provisions for revolving credit agreements of this type, including covenants limiting,with certain exceptions, 
(1) liens, (2) indebtedness, (3) sale and leaseback transactions, (4) investments, (5) dispositions, (6) changes in the nature of business, (7)transactions with affi
liates, (8) burdensome agreements, (9) restricted payments, (10) fundamental changes, (11) use of proceeds, (12) entering into swapagreements and (13) the 
ability to dispose of common stock of the Utility. In addition, the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement requires that PG&ECorporation (1) maintain 
a ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization of no greater than 70% as of the end of each fiscal quarter and (2) ifrevolving loans are outstand
ing as of the end of a fiscal quarter, a ratio of adjusted cash to fixed charges, as of the end of such fiscal quarter, of at least 150% priorto the date that PG&E Corporation 
first declares a cash dividend on its common stock and at least 100% thereafter.146

In the event of a default by PG&E Corporation under the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement, including cross-defaults relating to specified other debt ofPG&E Corporation or any of its signifi
cant subsidiaries in excess of $200 million, the administrative agent may, with the consent of the required lenders (or uponthe request of the requi
red lenders, shall), declare the amounts outstanding under the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement, including all accrued interest,payable immediate
ly. For events of default relating to insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, the amounts outstanding under the Corporation Revolving CreditAgreement become payabl
e immediately.PG&E Corporation may voluntarily r
epay outstanding loans under the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement at any time without premium or penalty, otherthan customary “breakag
e” costs with respect to eurodollar rate loans. Any voluntary repayments made by PG&E Corporation will not reduce the commitmentsunder the Corporation Revolving Credi
t Agreement.On the Effective Date, PG&E Corporat
ion repaid and terminated $300 million of outstanding borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated CreditAgreement, dated as of April 27, 2015, 
among PG&E Corporation, as borrower, the several lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrativeagent.

Pollution Control BondsThe California Pollution Control Fin
ancing Authority and the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank have issued various series of fixed rateand multi-modal tax-
exempt pollution control bonds for the benefit of the Utility.  Substantially all of the net proceeds of the pollution control bonds were used tofinance or refinanc
e pollution control and sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at the Geysers geothermal power plant or at the Utility’s Diablo Canyonnuclear power plant.  In 1999, the Ut
ility sold all bond-financed facilities at the non-retired units of the Geysers geothermal power plant to Geysers PowerCompany, LLC pursuant to purchase and sales 
agreements stating that Geysers Power Company, LLC will use the bond-financed facilities solely as pollutioncontrol faciliti
es for so long as any tax-exempt pollution control bonds issued to finance the Geysers project are outstanding.  Except for components that may havebeen abandoned in place or dispos
ed of as scrap or that are permanently non-operational, the Utility has no knowledge that Geysers Power Company, LLC intendsto cease using the b
ond-financed facilities solely as pollution control facilities.In accordance with the Plan, on Ju

ce from Chapter 11, in July 2020, PG&E Corporation raised an aggregate of $9.0 billion of gross proceeds through the issuance ofcommon stock and other equity
-linked instruments as described below.PG&E Corporation Investment Agreement

estment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with certain investors (the “Investors”) relating to theissuance and sale to the Inv
estors of an aggregate of $3.25 billion of PG&E Corporation’s common stock. Per the Investment Agreement, the price per share wasequal to $9.50 per share, which was the pub
lic equity offering price in the Common Stock Offering (as defined below in “Equity Offerings”).On July 1, 2020, pursuant to the terms of th
e Investment Agreement, PG&E Corporation issued to the Investors 342.1 million shares of common stock. TheInvestors and their aff
iliates have certain customary registration rights with respect to the Shares held by such Investor pursuant to the terms of the InvestmentAgreement.
Equity Offerings
On June 25, 2020, PG&E Corporation priced (i) the Com
mon Stock Offering of 423.4 million shares of its common stock, and (ii) the concurrent Equity UnitsOffering of 14.5 million of i
ts Equity Units, for total net proceeds to PG&E Corporation, after deducting the underwriting discounts and before estimated offeringexpenses payable by the PG&E Corporation, o
f $3.97 billion and $1.19 billion, respectively.On June 25, 2020, in connection with the Common Stock Off
ering, PG&E Corporation entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Common Stock UnderwritingAgreement”) with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Se
curities LLC, as representatives of several underwriters named in the Common StockUnderwriting Agreement (the 
“Common Stock Underwriters”), pursuant to which PG&E Corporation agreed to issue and sell 423.4 million shares of its commonstock to the Common Stock Underwriters. 
In addition, on June 25, 2020, PG&E Corporation entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Equity UnitsUnderwriting Agreement”) with Gold
man Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named in the EquityUnits Underwriting Agreement (th
e “Equity Units Underwriters”), pursuant to which PG&E Corporation agreed to issue and sell 14.5 million prepaid forwardstock purchase contracts 
(the “Purchase Contracts”) to the Equity Underwriters in order for the Equity Units Underwriters to sell 14.5 million Equity Units.In connection with the Common Stock Off
ering and pursuant to the Common Stock Underwriting Agreement, PG&E Corporation granted the underwriters a 30-day over-allotment opt
ion to purchase up to an additional 42.3 million shares of common stock. In addition, in connection with the Equity Units Offering andpursuant to the Equity Units Underwrit
ing Agreement, PG&E Corporation also granted the underwriters a 30-day over-allotment option to purchase up to anadditional 1.45 million Purch
ase Contracts to be used by the Equity Units Underwriters to create up to an additional 1.45 million Equity Units (together with the42.3 million shares of common s
tock, the “Option Securities”).The Common Stock Offering and the Equity Uni
ts Offering closed on July 1, 2020, and PG&E Corporation issued and sold a total of 423.4 million shares of itscommon stock and 14.5 million Purch
ase Contracts for total net proceeds of $5.2 billion. On July 24, 2020, the Equity Units Underwriters exercised in full, theover-allotment option 
in the Equity Units Underwriting Agreement and on August 3, 2020, PG&E Corporation issued and sold 1.45 million Equity Units to theEquity Units Underwriters (the “Addi
tional Units Issuance”). The prepaid forward stock purchase contract portion of the Equity Units issued in the Equity UnitsOffering and the Additional Units 
Issuance represents the right of the unitholders to receive, on the settlement date, between 125 million and 153 million shares,and between 12.5 million and 15.3 mi
llion shares, respectively, of PG&E Corporation common stock, based on the value of PG&E Corporation common stockover a measurement pe
riod specified in the purchase contracts and subject to certain adjustments as provided herein. The settlement date of the purchase contract isAugust 16, 2023, subject to acceler
ation or postponement as provided in the purchase contracts. The Common Stock Underwriters did not exercise their option topurchase any additional sha
res of common stock.152

PG&E Corporation applied accounting standards applicable to prepaid forward contracts to purchase common stock in order to determine the proper balance sheetclassification for 
the Equity Units issued and sold during the three months ended, September 30, 2020. The Equity Units are considered a range forward contract,in that the settlem
ent of common stock shares is based on a range of potential settlement outcomes. PG&E Corporation used various inputs, including stock pricevolatility, and deter
mined that the potential outcomes are predominantly fixed share settlements. As such, PG&E Corporation does not view the Equity Units as anobligation to issue a vari
able number of shares and has concluded that the Equity Units meet all conditions for equity classification and do not meet any of theother conditions that would resu
lt in asset or liability classification. The Equity Units issued and sold are classified as Common stock on PG&E Corporation’sConsolidated Balance Sheet.
Equity Backstop Commitments and Forward Stock Purchase Agreements
See “Equity Financing” in Note 2 above 
for discussion of the equity backstop commitments which resulted in total net proceeds of $523 million (of which$120.5 million were returned 
to the Backstop Parties pursuant to the Forward Stock Purchase Agreements, as described below).In connection with the Additiona
l Units Issuance and pursuant to the terms of the Forward Stock Purchase Agreements, on August 3, 2020, PG&E Corporation (i)redeemed a portion of th
e rights under the Forward Stock Purchase Agreements to receive shares of Common Stock and returned approximately $120.5 million tothe Backstop Parties and (ii
) issued and delivered to the Backstop Parties 42.3 million Greenshoe Backstop Shares, representing the unredeemed portion of theAggregate Greenshoe Backstop Purchase Amoun
t divided by the Settlement Price (without any issuance in respect of fractional shares).Equity Issuances to the Fire Victim Trust
On the Effective Date, pursuan
t to the Plan, the Utility entered into the Fire Victim Trust Assignment Agreement, pursuant to which the Utility transferred to theFire Victim Trust 477 mill
ion shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation. As a result of the Additional Units Issuance, on August 3, 2020, PG&E Corporationmade an equity contribut
ion of 748,415 shares to the Utility which delivered such additional shares of common stock to the Fire Victim Trust pursuant to an anti-dilution provision in the Fire Vi
ctim Trust Assignment Agreement.Cash Contribution to the Utility Pursuant to the Plan
On the Effective Date, PG&E Corporat
ion made an equity contribution of $12.9 billion in cash to the Utility, which used the funds to satisfy and discharge certainliabilities of PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility under the Plan. PG&E Corporation’s cash equity contribution was funded by proceeds from the financingtransactions described h
erein.Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles
Under Section 382 of the Interna
l Revenue Code, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” net operating loss carryforwardsand other tax attribut
es may be subject to certain limitations (which could limit PG&E Corporation or the Utility’s ability to use these deferred tax assets to offsettaxable income). In gen
eral, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five percent shareholders, applyingcertain look-through and agg
regation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generallythree years). PG&E Corporation’s 
and the Utility’s Amended Articles limit Transfers (as defined in the Amended Articles) that increase a person’s or entity’s(including certain groups o
f persons) ownership of PG&E Corporation’s equity securities to more than 4.75% prior to the Restriction Release Date withoutapproval by the Board of Directo
rs. The calculation of the percentage ownership may differ depending on whether the Fire Victim Trust is treated as a qualifiedsettlement trust or g
rantor trust.As of the date of this report, 
it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change and consequently, its net operating losscarryforwards and other t
ax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.153

In 2019, $6.75 billion of the liability to be paid to the Fire Victim Trust in PG&E Corporation’s common stock was accrued by the Utility. Because thecorresponding tax deduction gen
erally occurs no earlier than payment, the Utility established a deferred tax asset for the accrual in 2019. On July 1, 2020, theUtility issued to the Fire Vic
tim Trust 477 million shares of PG&E Corporation’s common stock. The shares transferred to the Fire Victim Trust were valued at$4.53 billion on the date of tr
ansfer, $2.2 billion less than the $6.75 billion that had been accrued as a liability in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Therefore, in the quart
er ended June 30, 2020, the Utility recorded a charge of $619 million to adjust the measurement of the deferred tax asset to reflect the tax-effected differ
ence between the accrual of $6.75 billion and the tax deduction of $4.53 billion for the transfer of PG&E Corporation’s shares to the Fire VictimTrust.
In addition, the tax deduct
ion recorded reflects PG&E Corporation’s conclusion as of December 31, 2020 that it is more likely than not that the Fire Victim Trustwill be treated as a “qu
alified settlement fund” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case the corresponding tax deduction will have occurred at the timethe PG&E Corporation common stock was tr
ansferred to the Fire Victim Trust. In January 2021, PG&E Corporation received an IRS ruling that states the Utility iseligible to make a gr
antor trust election for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the Fire Victim Trust and addressed certain, but not all, related issues.PG&E Corporation believes benefi
ts associated with “grantor trust” treatment could be realized, but only if PG&E Corporation and the Fire Victim Trust can meetcertain requirem
ents of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder, relating to sales of PG&E Corporation stock. PG&E Corporation expectsto elect grantor trus
t treatment, subject to entering into a definitive agreement with the Fire Victim Trust. There can be no assurance that such an agreement will bereached or that PG&E Corporation wi
ll be able to avail itself of the benefits of a grantor trust election. If PG&E Corporation makes a “grantor trust” election forthe Fire Victim Trust, the Ut
ility’s tax deduction will occur only at the time the Fire Victim Trust pays the fire victims and will be impacted by the price at whichthe Fire Victim Trust sel
ls the shares, rather than the price at the time such shares were contributed to the Fire Victim Trust.Dividends
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directo
rs of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s common stock, beginn
ing the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018.On April 3, 2019, the court overseeing th
e Utility’s probation issued an order imposing new conditions of probation, including forgoing issuing “any dividendsuntil [the Utility] is in
 compliance with all applicable vegetation management requirements” under applicable law and the Utility’s WMP.On March 20, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed a Case Resolution Contingency Process Motion with the Bankruptcy Court that includes a dividendrestriction for PG&E Corporat
ion. According to the dividend restriction, PG&E Corporation “will not pay common dividends until it has recognized $6.2 billion innon-GAAP core earnings following the Effe
ctive Date” of the Plan. The Bankruptcy Court entered the order approving the motion on April 9, 2020.In addition, the Corporation Revolv
ing Credit Agreement requires that PG&E Corporation (1) maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidatedcapitalization of no g
reater than 70% as of the end of each fiscal quarter and (2) if revolving loans are outstanding as of the end of a fiscal quarter, a ratio ofadjusted cash to fixed cha
rges, as of the end of such fiscal quarter, of at least 150% prior to the date that PG&E Corporation first declares a cash dividend on itscommon stock and at least 100
% thereafter.Under the Utility’s Articl
es of Incorporation, the Utility cannot pay common stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility’s preferredstock have been paid.  Additional
ly, the CPUC requires the Utility to maintain a capital structure composed of at least 52% equity on average. On May 28, 2020,the CPUC approved a final decision in th
e Chapter 11 Proceedings OII, which, among other things, grants the Utility a temporary, five -year waiver fromcompliance with its autho
rized capital structure for the financing in place upon the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11.  Subject to the foregoing res
trictions, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Boards of Directors and willdepend on, among other things, resul
ts of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Boards of Directorsmay deem relevant. As of Dec
ember 31, 2020, it is uncertain when PG&E Corporation and the Utility will commence the payment of dividends on their commonstock and when the Utility will co
mmence the payment of dividends on its preferred stock.154

Long-Term Incentive PlanThe PG&E Corporation LTIP permits various 
forms of share-based incentive awards, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares, and othershare-based awards, to elig
ible employees of PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries.  Non-employee directors of PG&E Corporation are also eligible to receivecertain share-based 
awards.  As of the Effective Date, the LTIP was amended to increase the maximum number of shares of PG&E Corporation common stockreserved for issuance unde

tock options granted under the LTIP and all other outstanding stock options is equal to the market price of PG&E Corporation’s commonstock on the date of grant.  Stock op
tions generally have a 10-year term and vest over three years of continuous service, subject to accelerated vesting in certaincircumstances. As of Decemb
er 31, 2020, $0.5 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options were expected to be recognizedover a weighted average pe
riod of 0.16 years for PG&E Corporation.The fair value of each s
tock option on the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation method.  The weighted average grant date fair value ofoptions granted using the Black-Scho
les valuation method in 2019 was $3.87 per share. No stock options were granted in 2020.  The significant assumptions usedfor shares granted in 2019 were:

1.51% to 1.52% Expected life (years)
4.5 Expected volatiliti
es are based on historical volatility of PG&E Corporation’s common stock.  The expected dividend payment is the dividend yield at the date ofgrant.  The risk-free in
terest rate for periods within the contractual term of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury rates in effect at the date of grant.  Theexpected life of stock o
ptions is derived from historical data that estimates stock option exercises and employee departure behavior.There was no tax benefit re
cognized from stock options for the year ended December 31, 2020.155

Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock units gran
ted after 2014 generally vest equally over three years. Vested restricted stock units are settled in shares of PG&E Corporation commonstock accompanied by cash pay
ments to settle any dividend equivalents associated with the vested restricted stock units.  Compensation expense is generallyrecognized ratably ove
r the vesting period based on grant-date fair value.  The weighted average grant-date fair value for restricted stock units granted during 2020,2019, and 2018 was $9.25, $18.57, and $40.92, respectively.  The to
tal fair value of restricted stock units that vested during 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $31 million,$42 million, and $41 million, r
espectively.  The tax detriment from restricted stock units that vested in 2020 was $19 million.  In general, forfeitures are recordedratably over the vesting p
eriod, using historical averages and adjusted to actuals when vesting occurs.  As of December 31, 2020, $6 million of total unrecognizedcompensation costs rela
ted to nonvested restricted stock units was expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 1.58 years.The following table summar

ion metric.  Dividend equivalents are paid in cash based on the amount of common stock to which the recipients are entitled. Compensation expen
se attributable to performance shares is generally recognized ratably over the applicable three -year period based on the gr ant-date fair valuedetermined using a Monte Car

NOTE 7: PREFERRED STOCK
PG&E Corporation has authorized 400 mi
llion shares of preferred stock, none of which is outstanding.The Utility has authorized 75 
million shares of first preferred stock, with a par value of $25 per share, and 10 million shares of $100 first preferred stock, with a parvalue of $100 per share.  At Decemb
er 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Utility’s preferred stock outstanding included $145 million of shares with interestrates between 5% and 6% design
ated as nonredeemable preferred stock and $113 million of shares with interest rates between 4.36% and 5% that are redeemablebetween $25.75 and $27.25 per share.  The Util
ity’s preferred stock outstanding are not subject to mandatory redemption. No shares of $100 first preferred stockare outstanding.
At December 31, 2020, annual dividends on th
e Utility’s nonredeemable preferred stock ranged from $1.25 to $1.50 per share.  The Utility’s redeemable preferredstock is subject to redemp
tion at the Utility’s option, in whole or in part, if the Utility pays the specified redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividendsthrough the redemption dat
e.  At December 31, 2020, annual dividends on redeemable preferred stock ranged from $1.09 to $1.25 per share.Dividends on all Utility pref
erred stock are cumulative.  All shares of preferred stock have voting rights and an equal preference in dividend and liquidation rights. Upon liquidation or dissolution of th
e Utility, holders of preferred stock would be entitled to the par value of such shares plus all accumulated and unpaiddividends, as specified for 
the class and series.  The Utility paid no dividends on preferred stock in 2020, 2019, or 2018.NOTE 8: EARNINGS PER SHARE
PG&E Corporation’s basic EPS is calcula
ted by dividing the income (loss) available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common sharesoutstanding.  PG&E Corporation applies th
e treasury stock method of reflecting the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based compensation in the calculation ofdiluted EPS.  The following is a reconc
iliation of PG&E Corporation’s income (loss) available for common shareholders and weighted average common sharesoutstanding for calcula
ting diluted EPS for 2020, 2019, and 2018.

NOTE 9: INCOME TAXESPG&E Corporation and the Utility use th
e asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  The income tax provision includes current and deferredincome taxes resulting 
from operations during the year. PG&E Corporation and the Utility estimate current period tax expense in addition to calculating deferredtax assets and liabilities.
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary tax and accounting timing differences, such as those arising from depreciationexpense.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return will besustained upon examination by t
axing authorities based on the merits of the position.  The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured based onthe largest amount of ben
efit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  As such, the difference between a tax position taken or expected tobe taken in a tax return 
in future periods and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to this guidance in the financial statements represents an unrecognizedtax benefit. 
Investment tax credits are deferre
d and amortized to income over time.  PG&E Corporation amortizes its investment tax credits over the projected investmentrecovery period.  The
 Utility amortizes its investment tax credits over the life of the related property in accordance with regulatory treatment.PG&E Corporation files a consolida
ted U.S. federal income tax return that includes the Utility and domestic subsidiaries in which its ownership is 80% or more. PG&E Corporation files a combined s
tate income tax return in California.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to a tax-sharing agreement under whichthe Utility determin
es its income tax provision (benefit) on a stand-alone basis. The significant components o
f income tax provision (benefit) by taxing jurisdiction were as follows:

 Includes the effect of federal flow-through ratemaking treatment for certain property-related costs.  For these temporary tax differences, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize the
deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities.  Therefore, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s effective tax rates are impac
ted as thesedifferences arise and reverse.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probable that 
these amounts will be recovered from orreturned to customers in future rates.  In 2020, 2019, and 2018, the amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess deferred tax benefits to be refunded to customers as a result of
the Tax Act passed in December 2017.
The Utility includes an adjustment for the measurement of the deferred tax asset associated wi
th the difference between the liability recorded related to the TCC RSA and the ultimate value ofPG&E Corporation stock contributed to the Fire Victim Trust. PG&E Corporation includes 
the same adjustment as the Utility and a permanent non-deductible equity backstop premiumexpense. This combined with a pre-tax loss and a pre-tax income for PG&E Corporation and the Utility, respectively, accounts for the remain
ing difference. These amounts primarily represent the impact of tax audit settle
ments and non-tax deductible costs in 2020 and 2019. (1) (2)

Other Tax MattersPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s un
recognized tax benefits are not likely to change significantly within the next 12 months. At December 31, 2020, it isreasonably possible that with
in the next 12 months, unrecognized tax benefits will decrease. The amount is not expected to be material.As of the date of this report, PG&E Corpor
ation does not believe that it had undergone an ownership change, and consequently, its net operating loss carryforwardsand other tax attribut
es are not limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.In March 2020, Congress passed, and the Presid
ent signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act. Under the CARES Act,PG&E Corporation and the Utility have d
eferred the payment of 2020 payroll taxes for the remainder of the year to 2021 and 2022.During June 2020, the State of Californ
ia enacted AB 85, which increases taxes on corporations over a three-year period beginning in 2020 by suspension of thenet operating loss deduction 
and a limit of $5 million per year on business tax credits. PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not anticipate any material impacts toPG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Financia
l Statements due to this legislation.In December 2020, Congress passed, and the Pr
esident signed into law the Consolidations and Appropriations Act of 2021. PG&E Corporation and the Utility donot expect this legisla
tion to have a material impact to PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Financial Statements.See “Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporat
ion’s Amended Articles” in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for informationon the possible election to 
treat the Fire Victim Trust as a “grantor trust” for federal income tax purposes.NOTE 10: DERIVATIVES
Use of Derivative Instruments
The Utility is expo
sed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities. Procurement costs are recovered throughcustomer rates. The Utilit
y uses both derivative and non-derivative contracts to manage volatility in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices.Derivatives include cont
racts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter.
Derivatives are presen
ted in the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded at fair value and on a net basis in accordance with master netting arrangementsfor each counterparty. Th
e fair value of derivative instruments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the intention tooffset exist.
Price risk management activities
 that meet the definition of derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments are notheld for speculative purpos
es and are subject to certain regulatory requirements. The Utility expects to fully recover in rates all costs related to derivatives underthe applicable ratemaking mechani
sm in place as long as the Utility’s price risk management activities are carried out in accordance with CPUC directives.Therefore, all unrea
lized gains and losses associated with the change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recorded within the Utility’s regulatoryassets and liabiliti
es on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives are recorded in the cost of electricity or the cost ofnatural gas with corresponding 
increases or decreases to regulatory balancing accounts for recovery from or refund to customers.The Utility elects the n
ormal purchase and sale exception for eligible derivatives. Eligible derivatives are those that require physical delivery in quantities that areexpected to be used by the Util
ity over a reasonable period in the normal course of business, and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the commoditydelivered.  These items 
are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. 161

atives instruments, including power purchase agreements, contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating fromeach of the major credit rating
 agencies, also known as a credit-risk-related contingent feature. Multiple credit agencies continue to rate the Utility belowinvestment grade, which resu
lts in the Utility posting additional collateral. As of December 31, 2020, the Utility satisfied or has otherwise addressed its obligationsrelated to the credit-risk related c
ontingency features.NOTE 11: FAIR VALUE 
MEASUREMENTSPG&E Corporation and the Utility me
asure their cash equivalents, trust assets and price risk management instruments at fair value.  A three-tier fair valuehierarchy is establish
ed that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:•
Level 1 – Observable inputs  that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.(1)(2) (3)
(1) 
(2)
(3)
162

•Level 2 – Other inputs that are  directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.•
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs which are support ed by little or no market activities.The fair value hiera
rchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.Assets and liabilities m
easured at fair value on a recurring basis for PG&E Corporation and the Utility are summarized below.  Assets held in rabbi trusts are heldby PG&E Corporation and not the Utility.

The following describes the va
luation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the tables above.  There are no restrictions onthe terms and conditions upon which 
the investments may be redeemed. There were no material transfers between any levels for the years ended December 31,2020 and 2019.
Trust Assets
Assets Measured at Fair Value
In general, investments h
eld in the trusts are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and market volatility risks. Nuclear decommissioning trust assetsand other trust assets ar
e composed primarily of equity and fixed-income securities and also include short-term investments that are money market funds valued atLevel 1.
Global equity securities p
rimarily include investments in common stock that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1. (1) 
(2)(1)
(2)
164

Fixed-income securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, includingcorporate debt securi
ties.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value isdetermined by observable
 market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of fixed-income securities classified asLevel 2 using evaluated pri
cing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation modelgenerally include bench
mark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuationmodel, as applicable.
Assets Measured at NAV Using Practical Exped
ientInvestments in the nucle
ar decommissioning trusts and the long-term disability trust that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedienthave not been classified 
in the fair value hierarchy tables above.  The fair value amounts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amountspresented in the Consolidated Ba
lance Sheets.  These investments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchangesas well as fixed-income s
ecurities that are composed primarily of U.S. government securities and asset-backed securities.Price Risk Management Instruments
Price risk management 
instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, andCRRs that are traded either on 
an exchange or over-the-counter. Power purchase agreements, fo
rwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded futures that are valued using observable marketforward prices for the unde
rlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-traded futures, or arevalued using forward prices f
rom broker quotes that are corroborated with market data are classified as Level 2.  Exchange-traded options are valued usingobservable market data and
 market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2. Long-dated power purchase agre
ements that are valued using significant unobservable data are classified as Level 3. These Level 3 contracts are valued usingeither estimated b
asis adjustments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends beyond aperiod for which market da
ta is available.  The Utility utilizes models to derive pricing inputs for the valuation of the Utility’s Level 3 instruments using pricinginputs from brokers and histor
ical data.The Utility holds CRRs to hedge the financ
ial risk of CAISO-imposed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is available in the CAISOauction and between auction d
ates; therefore, the Utility utilizes historical prices to forecast forward prices. CRRs are classified as Level 3.Level 3 Measurements and Uncertainty Analysis
Inputs used and the fair valu
e of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions to determine reasonableness.Significant increases o
r decreases in any of those inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reasonable costs related toLevel 3 instruments are e
xpected to be recoverable through customer rates; therefore, there is no impact to net income resulting from changes in the fair value ofthese instruments.  See Note 10 abov

ligible employees hired after this date or who made a one-time election to participate (“Pension Plan”).  Certain trusts underlying theseplans are qualified t
rusts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  If certain conditions are met, PG&E Corporation and the Utility can deductpayments made to the qual
ified trusts, subject to certain limitations.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funding policy is to contribute tax-deductible amounts,consistent with applicabl
e regulatory decisions and federal minimum funding requirements.  On an annual basis, the Utility funds the pension plans up to theamount it is authorized 
to recover in rates.PG&E Corporation and the Utility also sponso

cost trend rate as of December 31, 2020 was 6.3%, gradually decreasing to the ultimate trend rate of approximately 4.5% in 2028 andbeyond. 
Expected rates of retu
rn on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations ofthe employee benefit p
lan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Returns on fixed-income debt investments were projected based onreal maturity and c
redit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate.  Returns on equity investments were projected based on estimates of dividend yield and realearnings growth added to a long-t
erm inflation rate.  For the pension plan, the assumed return of 5.1% compares to a ten-year actual return of 9.6%.  The rate usedto discount pension benefits and o
ther benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of over approximately 835 Aa-grade non-callable bonds atDecember 31, 2020.  This yield curve h
as discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cash flows for the pension benefitsand other benefit obliga
tions were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.Investment Policies and Strategies
The financial position of PG&E Corpor
ation’s and the Utility’s funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefitobligations.  Volatility in 
funded status occurs when asset values change differently from liability values and can result in fluctuations in costs in financialreporting, as well as the a
mount of minimum contributions required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.  PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s investment policies and strategies are designed to increase the ratio of trust assets to plan liabilities at an acceptable level of fundedstatus volatility. 
The trusts’ asset alloc
ations are meant to manage volatility, reduce costs, and diversify its holdings.  Interest rate, credit, and equity risk are the key determinants ofPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
funded status volatility.  In addition to affecting the trusts’ fixed income portfolio market values, interest rate changes alsoinfluence liabili
ty valuations as discount rates move with current bond yields.  To manage volatility, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s trusts hold significantallocations in long matu
rity fixed-income investments. Although they contribute to funded status volatility, equity investments are held to reduce long-termfunding costs due to their highe
r expected return.  Real assets and absolute return investments are held to diversify the trust’s holdings in equity and fixed-incomeinvestments by exhibiting r
eturns with low correlation to the direction of these markets. Real assets include commodities futures, global real estate investmenttrusts (“REITS”), global list
ed infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  Absolute return investments include hedge fund portfolios. Derivative instruments su
ch as equity index futures are used to meet target equity exposure. Derivative instruments, such as equity index futures and U.S. treasuryfutures, are also used to r
ebalance the fixed income/equity allocation of the pension’s portfolio. Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge a portion ofthe non U.S. dollar exposure of global equ
ity investments.171

a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets.  The guidingprinciples of this risk
 management framework are the clear articulation of roles and responsibilities, appropriate delegation of authority, and proper accountabilityand documentation.  Trust inves
tment policies and investment manager guidelines include provisions designed to ensure prudent diversification, manage riskthrough appropriate use of physi
cal direct asset holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited investments.Fair Value Measurements

The following describes the va
luation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the table above.  All investments that arevalued using a net asset valu
e per share can be redeemed quarterly with a notice not to exceed 90 days.172

Short-Term InvestmentsShort-term investments 
consist primarily of commingled funds across government, credit, and asset-backed sectors. These securities are categorized as Level 1 andLevel 2 assets.
Global Equity securities
The global equity category 
includes investments in common stock and equity-index futures.  Equity investments in common stock are actively traded on publicexchanges and are there
fore considered Level 1 assets.  These equity investments are generally valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets for identicalsecurities.  Equity-index 
futures are valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets and are Level 1 assets.Real Assets
The real asset catego
ry includes portfolios of commodity futures, global REITS, global listed infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  The commodityfutures, global REITS, and global lis
ted infrastructure equities are actively traded on a public exchange and are therefore considered Level 1 assets. Fixed-Income securities
Fixed-income securiti
es are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, includingcorporate debt securi
ties.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value isdetermined by observable
 market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of debt securities classified as Level 2using evaluated pricing da
ta such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation modelgenerally include bench
mark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuationmodel, as applicable.
Assets Measured at NAV Using Practical Expedient
Investments in the trusts 
that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tablesabove. The fair value amoun
ts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Theseinvestments include com
mingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchanges as well as fixed-income securities that are composedprimarily of U.S. government se
curities, asset-backed securities, and private real estate funds. There are no restrictions on the terms and conditions upon which theinvestments may be redeemed.

e Utility’s funding policy, which is to contribute amounts that are tax-deductible and consistent with applicableregulatory decisions and f
ederal minimum funding requirements.  None of these pension or other benefits were subject to a minimum funding requirementrequiring a cash contribu

There were no material differences between the estimated benefits expected to be paid by PG&E Corporation and paid by the Utility for the years presented above. There were also no mater
ial differences between the estimated subsidies expected to be received by PG&E Corporation and received by the Utility for the yearspresented above.
Retirement Savings Plan
PG&E Corporation sponsors a retirem
ent savings plan, which qualifies as a 401(k) defined contribution benefit plan under the Internal Revenue Code 1986, asamended.  This plan permits 
eligible employees to make pre-tax and after-tax contributions into the plan, and provide for employer contributions to be made toeligible particip
ants.  Total expenses recognized for defined contribution benefit plans reflected in PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Income were$119 million, $109 million, and $105 m
illion in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Beginning January 1, 2019 PG&E Corporation changed its default matchingcontributions under its 401(k) p
lan from PG&E Corporation common stock to cash. Beginning in March 2019, at PG&E Corporation’s directive, the 401(k) plantrustee began purchasing new sha
res in the PG&E Corporation common stock fund on the open market rather than directly from PG&E Corporation.There were no materia
l differences between the employer contribution expense for PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the years presented above.NOTE 13: RELATED PARTY A
GREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONSThe Utility and other subsidia
ries provide and receive various services to and from their parent, PG&E Corporation, and among themselves.  The Utility andPG&E Corporation exchange administ
rative and professional services in support of operations.  Services provided directly to PG&E Corporation by the Utility arepriced at the higher of 
fully loaded cost (i.e., direct cost of good or service and allocation of overhead costs) or fair market value, depending on the nature of theservices.  Services provided d
irectly to the Utility by PG&E Corporation are generally priced at the lower of fully loaded cost or fair market value, depending onthe nature and value of th
e services.  PG&E Corporation also allocates various corporate administrative and general costs to the Utility and other subsidiaries usingagreed-upon allocation 
factors, including the number of employees, operating and maintenance expenses, total assets, and other cost allocation methodologies. Management believes that the
 methods used to allocate expenses are reasonable and meet the reporting and accounting requirements of its regulatory agencies.The Utility’s significan

NOTE 14: WILDFIRE-RELATED CONTINGENCIESPG&E Corporation and the Utility have s
ignificant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to wildfires. A provision for a losscontingency is recorded when i
t is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. PG&E Corporationand the Utility evaluate 
which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonably estimated losses and record a charge that reflects their bestestimate or the lower 
end of the range, if there is no better estimate. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or arange of losses is estimab
le, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly, and estimates areadjusted to reflect 
the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and otherinformation and events pe
rtaining to a particular matter. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs,which are expensed as incurr
ed. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materiallyaffected by the outcom
e of the following matters.2015 Butte Fire
In September 2015, a wildfire 
(the “2015 Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California. Cal Fire concluded that the2015 Butte fire was caused when a gray p
ine tree contacted the Utility’s electric line, which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by theUtility and/or its veget
ation management contractors, ACRT Inc. and Trees, Inc., to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management programultimately led to the failure of
 the tree.During the quarter ended Septe
mber 30, 2020, the remaining 2015 Butte fire claims were satisfied and discharged in accordance with the Plan. See “Pre-PetitionWildfire-Related Cl
aims and Discharge Upon Plan Effective Date” and “District Attorneys’ Office Investigations” below for more information on the 2015 Buttefire.
2018 Camp Fire and 2017 Northern California Wildfires Background
According to Cal Fire, on November 8, 2018 at 
approximately 6:33 a.m., a wildfire began near the city of Paradise, Butte County, California (the “2018 Campfire”), which is locat
ed in the Utility’s service territory. Cal Fire’s Camp Fire Incident Information Website as of November 15, 2019 (the “Cal Fire website”)indicated that the 2018 Camp 
fire consumed 153,336 acres. On the Cal Fire website, Cal Fire reported 85 fatalities and the destruction of 18,804 structuresresulting from the 2018 Camp f
ire.Beginning on October 8, 2017, multiple wild
fires spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Lake, Nevada, andYuba Counties, as well as in the are
a surrounding Yuba City (the “2017 Northern California wildfires”). According to the Cal Fire California Statewide FireSummary dated October 30, 2017, at th
e peak of the 2017 Northern California wildfires, there were 21 major fires that, in total, burned over 245,000 acres anddestroyed an estimated 8,900 s
tructures. The 2017 Northern California wildfires resulted in 44 fatalities.PG&E Corporation and the Utility were sub
ject to numerous claims in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. These includedclaims by various groups of wildf
ire victims, including individual plaintiffs, holders of insurance subrogation claims, and various federal, state and local entities.During the quarter ended Septe
mber 30, 2020, these claims were satisfied and discharged in accordance with the Plan, as described below.Pre-petition Wildfire-Re
lated Claims and Discharge Upon Plan Effective DatePre-petition wildfire
-related claims on the Consolidated Financial Statements include amounts associated with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern Californiawildfires, and the 2015 Butte fi
re.176

On July 1, 2020, pursuant to the Plan, PG&E Corporation and the Utility funded the Fire Victim Trust with $5.4 billion in cash (with an additional $1.35 billion tobe funded on a deferred basis
), 477 million shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation (representing 22.19% of the outstanding common stock of PG&ECorporation as of the Effec
tive Date (subject to potential adjustments)), plus the assignment of certain rights and causes of action. Additionally, as a result of theAdditional Units Issuance, on August 3, 2020, PG&E Corporation 
made an equity contribution of 748,415 shares to the Utility which delivered such additionalshares of common stock to the Fi
re Victim Trust pursuant to an anti-dilution provision in the Fire Victim Trust Assignment Agreement. In accordance with thePlan and the Confirmation Order, 
as a result of such funding, all Fire Victim Claims have been fully and finally satisfied, released and discharged and channeled tothe Fire Victim Trust with no r
ecourse to PG&E Corporation or the Utility. Accordingly, $12.15 billion of the $13.5 billion liability as of June 30, 2020 wasextinguished in the third qua
rter of 2020, and the remaining $1.35 billion will be paid out under the terms of the Tax Benefits Payment Agreement, as described inNote 2 under the heading “Signifi
cant Bankruptcy Court Actions.” On January 15, 2021, the Utility paid approximately $758 million of the $1.35 billion, pursuantto the Tax Benefits Payment Agre
ement.On July 1, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility funded 
the Subrogation Wildfire Trust for the benefit of holders of Subrogation Claims in the amount of$11.0 billion in cash and paid approx
imately $43 million in respect of professional fees of such claimants, for a total of approximately $52 million for subrogationwildfire claimants
’ professional fees. Such amount was initially funded into escrow and later paid to the Subrogation Wildfire Trust. In accordance with the Planand the Confirmation Order, as 
a result of such funding, all Subrogation Claims have been satisfied, released and discharged and channeled to the SubrogationWildfire Trust with no re
course to PG&E Corporation or the Utility. Accordingly, the $11.0 billion liability accrual for Subrogation Claims and $47.5 millionliability for profess
ional fees were extinguished in the third quarter of 2020.On July 1, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility paid $1.0 b
illion in cash to the Settling Public Entities and established a segregated fund in the amount of$10 million to be used to rei
mburse the Settling Public Entities for any and all legal fees and costs associated with the defense or resolution of any third partyclaims against the Set
tling Public Entities. In accordance with the Plan and the Confirmation Order, as a result of such payments, the $1.0 billion liability for thePublic Entity Wildfire Cl
aims (as defined below) was satisfied, released and discharged in the third quarter of 2020.Plan Support Agreements with Public Entities
On June 18, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility ent
ered into PSAs with certain local public entities (collectively, the “Supporting Public Entities”) providingfor an aggregate of $1.0 bil
lion to be paid by PG&E Corporation and the Utility to such public entities pursuant to the Plan in order to fully and finally settle anddischarge such public enti
ties’ claims against PG&E Corporation and the Utility relating to the 2018 Camp fire, 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2015 Buttefire (collectively, “Public E
ntity Wildfire Claims”).The PSAs also provide that, following the Ef
fective Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility would create and promptly fund $10 million to a segregated fund tobe used by the Supporting Public Entiti
es collectively in connection with the defense or resolution of claims against the Supporting Public Entities by third partiesrelating to the wildfi
res noted above (“Third Party Claims”).These elements were inco
rporated into the Plan which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court in the Confirmation Order. As described in Note 2 under the heading“Significant Bankruptcy Court Act
ions,” the actions required by each PSA were taken on or around the Effective Date.Restructuring Support Agreement with Holders of Subrogation Claims
On September 22, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity entered into the Subrogation RSA. The Subrogation RSA provides for an aggregate amount of$11.0 billion to be paid by PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility pursuant to the Plan in order to fully and finally settle the Subrogation Claims, upon the terms andconditions set forth in the Subrog
ation RSA. Under the Subrogation RSA, PG&E Corporation and the Utility also agreed to reimburse the holders of SubrogationClaims for professional f
ees of up to $55 million, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Subrogation RSA.As described above under the head
ing “Pre-petition Wildfire-Related Claims and Discharge Upon Plan Effective Date,” the payments described in the SubrogationRSA were made on the Effective Dat
e.177

Restructuring Support Agreement with the TCCOn December 6, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity entered into the TCC RSA. The TCC RSA (as incorporated into the Plan)  provides for, among otherthings, a combination of cash 
and common stock of the reorganized PG&E Corporation to be provided by PG&E Corporation and the Utility pursuant to the Plan(together with certa
in additional rights, the “Aggregate Fire Victim Consideration”) in order to settle and discharge the Fire Victim Claims, upon the terms andconditions set forth in the TCC RSA and the Plan. The Aggr
egate Fire Victim Consideration that has funded and will fund the Fire Victim Trust pursuant to thePlan for the benefit of hold
ers of the Fire Victim Claims consists of (a) $5.4 billion in cash that was contributed on the Effective Date of the Plan, (b) $1.35 billionin cash consisting of (i) $758 m
illion that was paid in cash on January 15, 2021 and (ii) the remaining balance of $592 million to be paid in cash on or beforeJanuary 15, 2022, in each case pursuan
t to the terms of the Tax Benefits Payment Agreement, and (c) an amount of common stock of the reorganized PG&ECorporation valued at 14.9 tim
es Normalized Estimated Net Income (as defined in the TCC RSA), except that the Fire Victim Trust’s share ownership of thereorganized PG&E Corporation would not be 
less than 20.9% based on the number of fully diluted shares of the reorganized PG&E Corporation outstanding as ofthe Effective Date of 
the Plan, assuming the Utility’s allowed ROE as of the date of the TCC RSA. Under certain circumstances, including certain change ofcontrol transactions and
 in connection with the monetization of certain tax benefits related to the payment of wildfire-related claims, the payments described inclause (b) will be acc
elerated and payable upon an earlier date. The Aggregate Fire Victim Consideration also included (1) the assignment by PG&E Corporationand the Utility to the Fire Vi
ctim Trust of certain rights and causes of action related to the 2015 Butte fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018Camp fire (together, th
e “Fires”) that PG&E Corporation and the Utility may have against certain third parties and (2) the assignment of rights under the 2015insurance policies to r
esolve any claims related to the Fires in those policy years, other than the rights of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to be reimbursed underthe 2015 insurance policies 
for claims submitted to and paid by PG&E Corporation and the Utility prior to the Petition Date to resolve any claims related to theFires in those policy years. Pursuan
t to a stipulation approved by the Bankruptcy Court on June 12, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility and the TCC, and thetrustee of the Fire Vict
im Trust agreed that the percentage ownership of the Fire Victim Trust would be 22.19% of the outstanding shares of the PG&E Corporationon the Effective Date, subj
ect to potential adjustments.As described above under the head
ing “Pre-petition Wildfire-Related Claims and Discharge Upon Plan Effective Date,” the funding to be made pursuant to theTCC RSA and the Plan was made on the Effective Dat
e.2019 Kincade Fire
According to Cal Fire, on October 23, 2019 at 
approximately 9:27 p.m., a wildfire began northeast of Geyserville in Sonoma County, California (the “2019Kincade fire”), loca
ted in the service territory of the Utility. The Cal Fire Kincade Fire Incident Update dated November 20, 2019, 11:02 a.m. Pacific Time (the“incident update”) ind
icated that the 2019 Kincade fire had consumed 77,758 acres. In the incident update, Cal Fire reported no fatalities and four first responderinjuries. The incident upda
te also indicates the following: structures destroyed, 374 (consisting of 174 residential structures, 11 commercial structures and 189other structures); and s
tructures damaged, 60 (consisting of 35 residential structures, one commercial structure and 24 other structures). In connection with the2019 Kincade fire, state and 
local officials issued numerous mandatory evacuation orders and evacuation warnings at various times for certain areas of the region.Based on County of Sonoma information, PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility understand that the geographic zones subject to either a mandatory evacuation orderor an evacuation warning betwe
en October 23, 2019 and November 4, 2019 included approximately 200,000 persons.On October 23, 2019, by 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 
the Utility had conducted a PSPS event and turned off the power to approximately 27,837 customers in SonomaCounty, including Geyserville and th
e surrounding area. As part of the PSPS, the Utility’s distribution lines in these areas were deenergized. Following theUtility’s established and CPUC-approved PSPS protocols 
and procedures, transmission lines in these areas remained energized.The Utility has submitted e
lectric incident reports to the CPUC indicating that:•
at approximately 9:19 p.m. Pacific Time on October 23, 2019, the Utility became aware of a transmission level outage on the Geysers #9 Lakeville 230kV line when the line relayed 
and did not reclose;•
various generating facilities on the Geysers #9 Lakeville 230 kV line detected the disturbance and separated at approximately the same time;•
at approximately 9:21 p.m. Pacific Time, the PG&E Grid Control Center received a report that a fire had started in an area near transmission tower001/006;
178

•at approximately 7:30 a.m. Pacific Time on October 24, 2019, a responding Utility troubleman patrolling the Geysers #9 Lakeville 230 kV line observedthat Cal Fire had taped off 
the area around the base of transmission tower 001/006 in the area of the 2019 Kincade fire; and•
on site Cal Fire personnel brought to the troubleman’s attention what appeared to be a broken jumper on the same tower.On July 16, 2020, Cal Fire issued a press rele
ase addressing the cause of the 2019 Kincade fire. The press release stated that Cal Fire has determined that “theKincade Fire was caused by elec
trical transmission lines owned and operated by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) located northeast of Geyserville. Tinder dryvegetation and strong winds combin
ed with low humidity and warm temperatures contributed to extreme rates of fire spread.”Cal Fire also indicated th
at its investigative report has been forwarded to the Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office, which is investigating the matter. OnSeptember 25, 2020, the Utility en
tered into a tolling agreement with the Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office in which the Utility agreed to waive anyapplicable statute o
f limitations for violations related to the Kincade fire that would otherwise have expired on or about October 23, 2020, for a period of sixmonths, until April 23, 2021. On February 24, 2021, the Sonoma County Dis
trict Attorney’s Office sent a search warrant to the Utility through its counsel inconnection with the investig
ation. The Utility expects to produce documents and respond to other requests for information in connection with the investigation andthe search warrant.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e also conducting their own investigation into the cause of the 2019 Kincade fire. This investigation is preliminary, and PG&ECorporation and the Utility do not h
ave access to all of the evidence in the possession of Cal Fire or other third parties.Potential liabilit
ies related to the 2019 Kincade fire depend on various factors, including but not limited to the cause of the fire, contributing causes of the fire(including alternat
ive potential origins, weather- and climate-related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed, the contents of suchstructures and other person
al property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants, the nature and extent of anypersonal injuries, the a
mount of fire suppression and clean-up costs, other damages the Utility may be responsible for if found negligent, and the amount of anypenalties, fines, or restit
ution that may be imposed by governmental entities.If the Utility’s fac
ilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are judicially determined to be the substantial cause of the 2019 Kincade fire, andthe doctrine of inverse 
condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees without havingbeen found negligent. Californ
ia courts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders againstutilities on the grounds tha
t losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community thatbenefited from such under
taking, and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers. Further, California courtshave determined that 
the doctrine of inverse condemnation is applicable regardless of whether the CPUC ultimately allows recovery by the utility for any suchcosts. The CPUC may decide not to authoriz
e cost recovery even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of thedoctrine of inverse conde
mnation. (See “Loss Recoveries – Regulatory Recovery” below for further information regarding potential cost recovery related to thewildfires.)
In light of the current s
tate of the law concerning inverse condemnation and the information currently available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including theinformation contained 
in the electric incident reports, Cal Fire’s determination of the cause, and other information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s investigation, PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire. Accordingly,PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
corded a charge for potential losses in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire in the amount of $625 million for the year endedDecember 31, 2020 (before ava
ilable insurance).The aggregate liabil
ity of $625 million for claims in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire (before available insurance) corresponds to the lower end of the rangeof PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility
’s reasonably estimable range of losses and is subject to change based on additional information. The $625 million estimatedoes not include, among other th
ings: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or theUtility, (ii) any punitiv
e damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by Federal or state agencies other than state fire suppression costs, (iv)evacuation costs or (v) any o
ther amounts that are not reasonably estimable.179

The Utility believes it will continue to receive additional information from potential claimants as litigation or resolution efforts progress. Any such additionalinformation may potent
ially allow PG&E Corporation and the Utility to refine such estimate and may result in changes to the accrual depending on the informationprovided.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility cur
rently believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of loss could be greater than $625 million (before availableinsurance) but are unabl
e to reasonably estimate the additional loss and the upper end of the range because, as described above, there are a number of unknownfacts and legal consideratio
ns that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted againstPG&E Corporation and the Utility. If 
the liability for the 2019 Kincade fire were to exceed $1.0 billion, it is possible the Utility would be eligible to make a claimto the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 for such 
excess amount, subject to the 40% limitation on claims arising before emergence from bankruptcy. PG&ECorporation and the Utility in
tend to continue to review the available information and other information as it becomes available, including evidence in Cal Fire’spossession, evidence from or he
ld by other parties, claims that have not yet been submitted, and additional information about the nature and extent of potentialdamages.
The process for estimat
ing losses associated with potential claims related to the 2019 Kincade fire requires management to exercise significant judgment based ona number of assumptions and subje
ctive factors, including the factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experiencewith wildfires. A
s more information becomes available, management estimates and assumptions regarding the potential financial impact of the 2019 Kincade firemay change.
The Utility has liabili
ty insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party liability attributable to the Kincade fire in an aggregate amount of$430 million. The Utility re
cords insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that recovery will occur, and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount orits range. As of December 31, 2020, the Ut
ility has recorded an insurance receivable for the full amount of the $430 million. While the Utility plans to seekrecovery of all insured 
losses, it is unable to predict the ultimate amount and timing of such insurance recoveries.PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
received data requests from the SED relating to the 2019 Kincade fire and have responded to all data requests received todate. The Sonoma County District Attorn
ey’s Office is currently investigating the fire and various other entities may also be investigating the fire. It is uncertainwhen the investigations will be 
complete.As of February 24, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty are aware of 22 complaints on behalf of approximately 504 plaintiffs related to the 2019 Kincade fireand expect that they may 
receive further such complaints. The complaints were filed in the California Superior Court for the County of Sonoma and the CaliforniaSuperior Court for the County of San Francis
co and include claims based on multiple theories of liability, including inverse condemnation, negligence, violationsof the Public Utilities Code, vio
lations of the Health & Safety Code, premises liability, trespass, public nuisance and private nuisance. The plaintiffs in each actionprincipally assert th
at PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s alleged failure to properly maintain, inspect and de-energize their transmission lines was the cause ofthe 2019 Kincade fire. The pla
intiffs seek damages that include property damage, economic loss, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and otherdamages. On December 3, 2020, PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility filed a petition with the California Judicial Council to coordinate the litigation. The petitionrequests that the cases b
e coordinated in Sonoma County Superior Court. On December 18, 2020, certain plaintiffs filed a brief in support of PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s petit
ion. On December 21, 2020, January 4, 2021 and January 27, 2021, certain plaintiffs filed briefs that supported coordination but requestedthat the cases be coordin
ated in San Francisco County Superior Court. On February 2, 2021, pursuant to authorization from the California Judicial Council, a judgeof the Sonoma County Superior Court was assigned to s
erve as the coordination motion judge to decide whether the aforementioned actions should be coordinatedand, if so, recommend where th
e coordinated proceeding should take place. A hearing is scheduled for April 2, 2021.In addition to claims fo
r property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be liable for fire suppressioncosts, evacuation costs, med
ical expenses, personal injury damages, punitive damages and other damages under other theories of liability, including if PG&ECorporation or the Utility wer
e found to have been negligent.180

2020 Zogg FireAccording to Cal Fire, on September 27, 2020, 
a wildfire began in the area of Zogg Mine Road and Jenny Bird Lane, north of Igo in Shasta County, California (the“2020 Zogg fire”), located 
in the service territory of the Utility. The Cal Fire Zogg fire Incident Update dated October 16, 2020, 3:08 p.m. Pacific Time (the“incident update”), ind
icated that the 2020 Zogg fire had consumed 56,338 acres. The incident update reported four fatalities and one injury. The incident updatealso indicated that 27 st
ructures were damaged and 204 structures were destroyed. Of the 204 structures destroyed, 63 were single family homes, according to adamage inspection repor
t available from the Shasta County Department of Resource Management.On October 9, 2020, the Utility submitt
ed an electric incident report to the CPUC indicating that:•
wildfire camera and satellite data on September 27, 2020 show smoke, heat or signs of fire in the area of Zogg Mine Road and Jenny Bird Lane betweenapproximately 2:43 p.m. and 2:46 p.
m. Pacific Time;•
according to Utility records, on September 27, 2020, a SmartMeter and a line recloser serving the area of Zogg Mine Road and Jenny Bird Lane reportedalarms and other act
ivity starting at approximately 2:40 p.m. until 3:06 p.m. Pacific Time when the line recloser de-energized a portion of the Girvan1101 12 kV circuit, a distribution 
line that serves that area;•
the data currently available to the Utility do not establish the causes of the activity on the Girvan 1101 circuit or the locations of these causes;•
on October 9, 2020, Cal Fire informed the Utility that they had taken possession of Utility equipment as part of Cal Fire’s ongoing investigation into thecause of the 2020 Zogg fire and a
llowed the Utility access to the area; and•
Cal Fire has not issued a determination as to the cause.The cause of the 2020 Zogg fire r
emains under investigation by Cal Fire, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility are cooperating with its investigation. PG&ECorporation and the Utility hav
e received and are responding to data requests from the SED relating to the 2020 Zogg fire. The Shasta County District Attorney’sOffice is investigating 
the fire, and various other entities, which may include other law enforcement agencies, may also be investigating the fire. It is uncertainwhen any such investigations will be 
complete. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are also conducting their own investigation into the cause of the 2020 Zogg fire.This investigation is prel
iminary, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not have access to the evidence in the possession of Cal Fire or other third parties.Potential liabilit
ies related to the 2020 Zogg fire depend on various factors, including but not limited to the cause of the fire, contributing causes of the fire(including alternat
ive potential origins, weather- and climate-related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed, the contents of suchstructures and other person
al property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants, the nature and extent of anypersonal injuries, includ
ing the loss of lives, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs, other damages the Utility may be responsible for if found negligent,and the amount of any penalt
ies, fines, or restitution that may be imposed by governmental entities.Based on the current state o
f the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utilityas of the date of this fi
ling, including the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utilitybelieve it is probable 
that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire and accordingly recorded a pre-tax charge in the amount of $275 million forthe quarter ending Decem
ber 31, 2020 (before available insurance). If the Utility’s facilities, such as its electric distribution lines, are judicially determined to bethe substantial cause of 
the Zogg fire, and the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, business interruption,interest and attorneys
’ fees without having been found negligent. For more information regarding the inverse condemnation doctrine, see “2019 Kincade Fire”above.
The aggregate liabil
ity of $275 million for claims in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire (before available insurance) corresponds to the lower end of the range ofPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
reasonably estimable range of losses, and is subject to change based on additional information. This $275 million estimatedoes not include, among other th
ings: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or theUtility, (ii) any punitiv
e damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal, state, county and local government entities or agencies other thanstate fire suppression cos
ts, or (iv) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable.181

PG&E Corporation and the Utility currently believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of the loss will be greater than $275 million and are unable toreasonably estimate 
the additional loss and the upper end of the range because, as described above, there are a number of unknown facts and legal considerationsthat may impact the 
amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted against PG&E Corporation and the Utility.If the liability fo
r the 2020 Zogg fire were to exceed $1.0 billion, it is possible the Utility would be eligible to make a claim to the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054for such excess amount. PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility intend to continue to review the available information and other information as it becomes available,including evidence in Cal Fir
e’s possession, evidence from or held by other parties, claims that have not yet been submitted, and additional information about thenature and extent of person
al and business property damages and losses, the nature, number and severity of personal injuries, and information made availablethrough the discovery process. In p
articular, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not had access to all of the evidence obtained by Cal Fire or other thirdparties.
The process for estimat
ing losses associated with potential claims related to the 2020 Zogg fire requires management to exercise significant judgment based on anumber of assumptions and subjec
tive factors, including the factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experiencewith wildfires. As more inform
ation becomes available, management estimates and assumptions regarding the potential financial impact of the 2020 Zogg fire maychange.
The Utility has liabili
ty insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party liability attributable to the 2020 Zogg fire in an aggregate amountof $867.5 million. The Utility r
ecords insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that recovery will occur, and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amountor its range. As of December 31, 2020, th
e Utility has recorded an insurance receivable for $219 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the2020 Zogg fire, which equals the $275 mi
llion probable loss estimate less an initial self-insured retention of $60 million, plus $4 million in legal fees incurred.PG&E Corporation and the Utility int
end to seek full recovery for all insured losses. If PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to recover the full amount oftheir insurance, PG&E Corporation
’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.As of February 24, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty are aware of six complaints on behalf of approximately 240 plaintiffs related to the 2020 Zogg fire andexpect that they may r
eceive further such complaints. The complaints were filed in the California Superior Court for the County of Shasta and the CaliforniaSuperior Court for the County of San Francis
co and include claims based on multiple theories of liability, including inverse condemnation, negligence, violationsof the Public Utilities Code, vio
lations of the Health & Safety Code, premises liability, trespass, public nuisance and private nuisance. The plaintiffs in each actionprincipally assert th
at PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s alleged failure to properly maintain, inspect and de-energize their distribution lines was the cause ofthe 2020 Zogg fire. The plainti
ffs seek damages that include wrongful death, property damage, economic loss, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’fees and other damages. On Februa
ry 5, 2021, certain plaintiffs filed a petition with the California Judicial Council to coordinate five civil cases filed against theUtility and PG&E Corporation in the Super
ior Courts of Shasta and San Francisco counties. The petition requests that the cases be coordinated in San FranciscoSuperior Court.
In addition to claims fo
r property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be liable for fire suppressioncosts, evacuation costs, med
ical expenses, wrongful death and personal injury damages, punitive damages and other damages under other theories of liability,including if PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility were found to have been negligent.Loss Recoveries
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
insurance coverage for liabilities, including wildfire. Additionally, there are several mechanisms that allow for recovery ofcosts from customers. Potent
ial for recovery is described below. Failure to obtain a substantial or full recovery of costs related to wildfires or any conclusion thatsuch recovery is no longer probab
le could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, andcash flows. In addition, the inab
ility to recover costs in a timely manner could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,results of operations, liqu
idity, and cash flows.182

InsuranceInsurance Coverage
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an amount of $430 million (subject to an initial self-insured retention of$10 million per occurren
ce) for the period from August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020, and approximately $1 billion in liability insurance coverage for non-wildfireevents (subject to an ini
tial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence), comprised of $520 million for the period from August 1, 2019 through July 31,2020 and $480 million for the per
iod from September 3, 2019 through September 2, 2020. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s cost of obtaining this wildfire andnon-wildfire insurance cov
erage in place for the period of August 1, 2019 through September 2, 2020 is approximately $212 million.In July 2020, and through additional pur
chases in August 2020, the Utility renewed its liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in the amount of$867.5 million (subject to an 
initial self-insured retention of $60 million), comprised of $825 million for the period of August 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021 and$42.5 million in reinsuranc
e for the period of July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021. In addition, the Utility renewed its liability insurance coverage for non-wildfireevents in the amount of $700 mi
llion (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million) for the period from August 1, 2020 through July 31, 2021. PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s cost of obtaining this wildfire and non-wildfire coverage is approximately $859 million. At December 31, 2020, PG&E Corporationand the Utility had prepaid 
insurance of $536 million, reflected in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Various coverage limit
ations applicable to different insurance layers could result in material uninsured costs in the future depending on the amount and type ofdamages resulting from 
covered events.In the Utility’s 2020 GRC proceeding, the CPUC also approv
ed a settlement agreement provision that allows the Utility to recover annual insurance costs for up to$1.4 billion in general li
ability insurance coverage. An advice letter will be required for additional coverage purchased by the Utility in excess of $1.4 billion incoverage.
The Utility will not be able 
to obtain any recovery from the Wildfire Fund for wildfire-related losses in any year that do not exceed the greater of $1.0 billion in theaggregate and the amount o
f insurance coverage required under AB 1054. (See “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” below.)Insurance Receivable
PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord a receivable for insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that recovery of a recorded loss will occur. ThroughDecember 31, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity recorded $430 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, and$219 million for probable insu
rance recoveries in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recovered all of the insurance for the2015 Butte fire and the 2018 Camp fi
re. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recovered all of the insurance except for $25 million for the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires. Thes
e amounts reflect an assumption that the cause of each fire is deemed to be a separate occurrence under the insurance policies. PG&ECorporation and the Utility in
tend to seek full recovery for all insured losses.If PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
are unable to recover the full amount of their insurance, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results ofoperations, liquidity, and c
ash flows could be materially affected.The balances for insuranc
e receivables with respect to wildfires are included in Other accounts receivable in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ConsolidatedBalance Sheets:

Regulatory RecoveryOn June 21, 2018, the CPUC issued a decision granting the Uti
lity’s request to establish a WEMA to track specific incremental wildfire liability costs effective asof July 26, 2017. The decision does not grant 
the Utility rate recovery of any wildfire-related costs. Any such rate recovery would require CPUC authorization in aseparate proceeding. The Ut
ility may be unable to fully recover costs in excess of insurance, if at all. Rate recovery is uncertain; therefore, the Utility has notrecorded a regulatory 
asset related to any wildfire claims costs. Even if such recovery is possible, it could take a number of years to resolve and a number of yearsto collect.
In addition, SB 901, signed into law on Septembe
r 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a CHT, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in theaggregate, so that they do not 
exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming ratepayers or materially impacting its ability to provideadequate and safe servi
ce. SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referredto as “securitizat
ion”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts inexcess of the CHT.
On January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a pro
cess to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the CHT in futureapplications under Section 451.2
(a) of the Public Utilities Code for recovery of costs related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires.On July 8, 2019, the CPUC issued a decision in the CHT proceeding. The d
ecision adopts a methodology to determine the CHT based on (1) the maximumadditional debt that a utilit
y can take on and maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating; (2) excess cash available to the utility; (3) a potential regulatoryadjustment of 20% of the CHT or fiv
e percent of the total disallowed wildfire liabilities; and (4) an adjustment to preserve for ratepayers any tax benefitsassociated with the CHT. The decision 
also requires a utility to include proposed ratepayer protection measures to mitigate harm to ratepayers as part of anapplication under Section 451.2
(b).Pursuant to SB 901 and the CPUC’s methodology adopted in the CHT OIR, on April 30, 2020, the Ut
ility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorizationfor a post-emergence 
transaction to securitize $7.5 billion of 2017 wildfire claims costs that is designed to not impact amounts billed to customers, with theproceeds used to pay or reimbu
rse the Utility for the payment of wildfire claims costs associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. As a result of theproposed transaction, the Uti
lity would retire $6.0 billion of Utility debt and accelerate a $592 million payment due to the Fire Victim Trust.Failure to obtain a substant
ial or full recovery of costs related to wildfires could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition, results of opera
tions, liquidity and cash flows.Wildfire-Related Derivativ
e LitigationTwo purported derivative lawsui
ts alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment were filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court onNovember 16, 2017 and November 20, 2017, respect
ively, naming as defendants certain current and former members of the Board of Directors and certain currentand former officers o
f PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are named as nominal defendants. These lawsuits were consolidatedby the court on February 14, 2018 and are d
enominated In Re California North Bay Fire Derivative Litigation. On April 13, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a consolidatedcomplaint. After the pa
rties reached an agreement regarding a stay of the derivative proceeding pending resolution of the tort actions described above and anyregulatory proceeding r
elating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, on April 24, 2018, the court entered a stipulation and order to stay. The stay was subjectto certain conditions r
egarding the plaintiffs’ access to discovery in other actions. On January 28, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a request to lift the stay for the purposesof amending their compl
aint to add allegations regarding the 2018 Camp fire. Prior to resolution of the plaintiffs’ request to lift the stay, this matter wasautomatically stay
ed by PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, as discussed below. On November 12, 2020, the Trusteefor the Fire Victim Trust 
filed a motion to intervene to substitute as the plaintiff in the matter. A case management conference is currently scheduled for March 18,2021, at which time the court wi
ll also hear the motion to intervene.184

On August 3, 2018, a third purported derivative lawsuit, entitled Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retiremen t System v. Chew, et al. (now captioned  Trotter v. PG&E Corp., et al.
), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, naming as defendants certain current and former members of theBoard of Directors and cert
ain current and former officers of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation is named as a nominal defendant. The lawsuitalleges claims for b
reach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment as well as a claim under Section 14(a) of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934 allegingthat PG&E Corporation’s and the Util
ity’s 2017 proxy statement contained misrepresentations regarding the companies’ risk management and safety programs. OnOctober 15, 2018, PG&E Corporation filed a mo
tion to stay the litigation. Prior to the scheduled hearing on this motion, this matter was automatically stayed byPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, as discussed below. On December 14, 2020, the court entered a stipulation andorder to substitute the Fir
e Victim Trust as the plaintiff. A case management conference is currently set for April 15, 2021.On October 23, 2018, a fourth purported der
ivative lawsuit, entitled City of Warren Police and Fire Re tirement System v. Chew, et al., was filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, alleging cla
ims for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and unjust enrichment. It named as defendants certain current and formermembers of the Board of Dire
ctors and certain current and former officers of PG&E Corporation, and named PG&E Corporation as a nominal defendant. Theplaintiff filed a 
request with the court seeking the voluntary dismissal of this matter without prejudice on January 18, 2019.On November 21, 2018, a fifth purported de
rivative lawsuit, entitled Williams v. Earley, Jr., et al. (now captioned Trotter v. Earley, et al. ), was filed in federal court in San Francisco, alleg
ing claims identical to those alleged in the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retiremen t System v. Chew, et al. lawsuit listed above against certain cur
rent and former officers and directors, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants. This lawsuit includes allegationsrelated to the 2017 Northern Ca
lifornia wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire. This action was stayed by stipulation of the parties and order of the court on December21, 2018, subject to resolution of th
e pending securities class action. On January 7, 2021, the court entered a stipulation and order to substitute the Fire VictimTrust as the plaintiff. A c
ase management conference is currently set for April 15, 2021.On December 24, 2018, a sixth purported de
rivative lawsuit, entitled Bowlinger v. Chew, et al. (now captioned Trotter v. Chew, et al .), was filed in San Francisco Superior Court, alleging cla
ims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment in connection with the 2018 Camp fireagainst certain cur
rent and former officers and directors, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants. On February 5, 2019, the plaintifffiled a response to the not
ice asserting that the automatic stay did not apply to his claims. PG&E Corporation and the Utility accordingly filed a Motion to Enforcethe Automatic Stay with the Bankrup
tcy Court as to the Bowlinger action, which was granted. On November 5, 2020, the court entered a stipulation and order tosubstitute the Fire Victi
m Trust as the plaintiff. On February 24, 2021, the Fire Victim Trust filed an amended complaint, alleging two causes of action for breachof fiduciary duty against 
certain former officers and directors. The first cause of action alleges breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the 2017 NorthernCalifornia wildfires, and 
the second cause of action alleges breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the 2018 Camp fire. PG&E Corporation and the Utilityare no longer named as nomin
al defendants. A case management conference is currently set for March 18, 2021.On January 25, 2019, a seventh purported der
ivative lawsuit, entitled Hagberg v. Chew, et al. , was filed in San Francisco Superior Cour t, alleging claims forbreach of fiduciary duty, 
abuse of control, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment in connection with the 2018 Camp fire against certain current and formerofficers and directo
rs, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants. A case management conference is currently set for July 7, 2021.On January 28, 2019, an eighth purported der
ivative lawsuit, entitled Blackburn v. Meserve, et al. (now captioned Trotter v. Meserve, et al.) , was filed in federal court alleging clai
ms for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires andthe 2018 Camp fire against c
ertain current and former officers and directors, and naming PG&E Corporation as a nominal defendant. On January 8, 2021, the courtentered a stipulation 
and order to substitute the Fire Victim Trust as the plaintiff. A case management conference is currently set for April 15, 2021.Due to the commencement o
f the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed notices in each of these proceedings on February 1, 2019, reflectingthat the proceedings were 
automatically stayed through the Effective Date pursuant to section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s rights with respe
ct to the derivative claims asserted against former officers and directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility were assigned to the FireVictim Trust under the TCC RSA. The assignment be
came effective as of the Effective Date of the Plan.185

The above purported derivative lawsuits were brought against the named defendants on behalf of PG&E Corporation and/or the Utility. As a result of theassignment of these cla
ims to the Fire Victim Trust, any recovery based on these claims would be paid to the Fire Victim Trust. Any such recovery is limited to theextent of any director 
and officer insurance policy proceeds paid by any insurance carrier to reimburse PG&E Corporation and/or the Utility for amounts paidpursuant to their indemni
fication obligations in connection with such causes of action.Securities Class Action Litigation
Wildfire-Related Class Action
In June 2018, two purported securiti
es class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, naming PG&ECorporation and certain of 
its current and former officers as defendants, entitled David C. Weston v. PG&E Corporation, et al.  and Jon Paul Moretti v. PG&E Corporation, et al.
, respectively.  The compl aints alleged material misrepresentations and omissions related to, among other things, vegetation management andtransmission line safe
ty in various PG&E Corporation public disclosures. The complaints asserted claims under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the federalSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rul
e 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and sought unspecified monetary relief, interest, attorneys’ fees and other costs. Bothcomplaints identifi
ed a proposed class period of April 29, 2015 to June 8, 2018. On September 10, 2018, the court consolidated both cases and the litigation is nowdenominated 
In re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigat ion. The court also appointed the Publ ic Employees Retirement Association of New Mexico (“PERA”) aslead plaintiff. The pl
aintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint on November 9, 2018. After the plaintiff requested leave to amend its complaint to addallegations regarding 
the 2018 Camp fire, the plaintiff filed a second amended consolidated complaint on December 14, 2018.Due to the commencement o
f the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a notice on February 1, 2019, reflecting that the proceedings wereautomatically stay
ed as to PG&E Corporation and the Utility pursuant to section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. On February 15, 2019, PG&E Corporation andthe Utility filed a complaint
 in Bankruptcy Court against the plaintiff seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to extend the stay to the claims allegedagainst the individual of
ficer defendants.On February 22, 2019, a third purported secu
rities class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled York County on behalf of the York County Retiremen
t Fund, et al. v. Rambo, et al. (the “York County Action”). The compl aint names as defendants certain current andformer officers and d
irectors, as well as the underwriters of four public offerings of notes from 2016 to 2018. Neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility is namedas a defendant. The compla
int alleges material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the note offerings related to, among other things, PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s vegetation management and wildfire safety measures. The complaint asserts claims under Section 11 and Section 15 of theSecurities Act of 1933, and seeks unspe
cified monetary relief, attorneys’ fees and other costs, and injunctive relief. On May 7, 2019, the York County Action wasconsolidated with 
In re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigat ion.On May 28, 2019, the plaintiffs in the 
consolidated securities actions filed a third amended consolidated class action complaint, which includes the claims assertedin the previously filed a
ctions and names as defendants PG&E Corporation, the Utility, certain current and former officers and directors, and the underwriters. OnAugust 28, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court denied PG&E Corporation
’s and the Utility’s request to extend the stay to the claims against the officer, director, andunderwriter defendants. On Octobe
r 4, 2019, the officer, director, and underwriter defendants filed motions to dismiss the third amended complaint, which motionsare currently under subm
ission with the District Court.186

Satisfaction of HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordinated Debt ClaimsClaims against PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility relating to, among others, the three purported securities class actions (described above) that have beenconsolidated and denominat
ed In re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigat ion, U.S. District Court for the Northern Dist rict of California, Case No. 18-03509, willbe resolved pursuant to the Plan. As des
cribed above, these claims consist of pre-petition claims under the federal securities laws related to, among other things,allegedly misleading statements
 or omissions with respect to vegetation management and wildfire safety disclosures, and are classified into separate categoriesunder the Plan, each of which is subj
ect to subordination under the Bankruptcy Code. The first category of claims consists of pre-petition claims arising from orrelated to the common s
tock of PG&E Corporation (such claims, with certain other similar claims against PG&E Corporation, the “HoldCo Rescission or DamageClaims”). The second catego
ry of pre-petition claims, which comprises two separate classes under the Plan, consists of claims arising from debt securities issuedby PG&E Corporation and the Utility (such 
claims, with certain other similar claims against PG&E Corporation and the Utility, the “Subordinated Debt Claims,”and together with the HoldCo Rescission or Da
mage Claims, the “Subordinated Claims”).While PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity believe they have defenses to the Subordinated Claims, as well as insurance coverage that may be available in respect ofthe Subordinated Claims, these d
efenses may not prevail and any such insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the full amount of the allowed claims. Inthat case, PG&E Corporation and the Ut
ility will be required, pursuant to the Plan, to satisfy such claims as follows:•
each holder of an allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claim will receive a number of shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation equal to suchholder’s HoldCo Rescission or Damage Clai
m Share (as such term is defined in the Plan); and•
each holder of an allowed Subordinated Debt Claim will receive payment in full in cash.PG&E Corporation and the Utility have b
een engaged in settlement efforts with respect to the Subordinated Claims. If the Subordinated Claims are not settled(with any such resolution being subj
ect to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court), PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect that the Subordinated Claims will beresolved by the Bankruptcy Court in th
e claims reconciliation process and treated as described above under the Plan. Under the Plan, after the Effective Date,PG&E Corporation and the Utility have 
the authority to compromise, settle, object to, or otherwise resolve proofs of claim, and the Bankruptcy Court retainsjurisdiction to hear dispu
tes arising in connection with disputed claims. With respect to the Subordinated Claims, the claims reconciliation process may includelitigation of the me
rits of such claims, including the filing of motions, fact discovery, and expert discovery. The total number and amount of allowed SubordinatedClaims, if any, was not determ
ined at the Effective Date. To the extent any such claims are allowed, the total amount of such claims could be material, andtherefore could resul
t in (a) the issuance of a material number of shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation with respect to allowed HoldCo Rescission orDamage Claims, and/or (b) th
e payment of a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims. There can be no assurance that suchclaims will not have a m
aterial adverse impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Further, if shares are issu
ed in respect of allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, it may be determined that under the Plan, the Fire Victim Trust shouldreceive additional sh
ares of common stock of PG&E Corporation (assuming, for this purpose, that shares issued in respect of the HoldCo Rescission or DamageClaims were issued on the Effe
ctive Date).The named plaintiffs in 
the consolidated securities actions filed proofs of claim with the Bankruptcy Court on or before the bar date that reflect their securitieslitigation claims 
against PG&E Corporation and the Utility. On December 9, 2019, the lead plaintiff in the consolidated securities actions filed a motion seekingapproval from the Bankruptcy Cour
t to treat its proof of claim as a class proof of claim. On February 27, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying themotion, but extending the bar d
ate for putative class members to file proofs of claim until April 16, 2020. On March 6, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a notice ofappeal regarding the den
ial of its motion. On May 15, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed the opening brief for its appeal. On June 15, 2020, PG&E Corporation and theUtility filed its bri
ef in response. On June 29, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed its reply. No hearing date has been set.On July 2, 2020, PERA filed a notice of appeal of 
the Confirmation Order to the District Court, solely to the extent of seeking review of that part of theConfirmation Order approving th
e Insurance Deduction (as defined in the Plan) with respect to the formula for the determination of the HoldCo Rescission orDamage Claims Share. On September 3, 2020, PERA fil
ed its principal brief in support of the appeal. On October 5, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filedtheir response brief. PERA filed 
its reply brief on October 26, 2020. No hearing date has been set.187

On September 1, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a motion (the “Securities Claims Procedures Motion”) with the Bankruptcy Court to approveprocedures to allow for the 
resolution of the outstanding and unresolved Subordinated Claims, which motion, among other things, requests approval of certaininformation request pro
cedures, standard and abbreviated mediation processes, and procedures with respect to the potential filing of omnibus claim objections withrespect to the Subordinated Cl
aims. PERA and a number of other parties filed objections to the Securities Claims Procedures Motion.On September 28, 2020, PERA filed a second motion r
equesting the Bankruptcy Court exercise its discretion pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 7023 to allow PERA tofile a class proof of c
laim on behalf of the holders of Subordinated Claims (the “Renewed 7023 Motion”). The Bankruptcy Court set a briefing schedule that,among other things, (i) adjou
rned the hearing on the Securities Claims Procedures Motion to November 17, 2020, and (ii) established a briefing scheduled withrespect to the Renewed 7023 Motion with 
a hearing on the motion also scheduled for November 17, 2020. PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed their objectionto the Renewed 7023 Motion on October 29, 2020. On Decembe
r 4, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court issued an oral decision approving PG&E Corporation’s and theUtility’s Securities Cla
ims Procedures Motion and denying PERA’s Renewed 7023 Motion. On January 25, 2021, following a timeline set by the BankruptcyCourt as part of the oral de
cision to resolve any outstanding non-substantive objections to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s proposed order granting theSecurities Claims Procedur
es Motion, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a revised proposed order, which the Bankruptcy Court entered the same day. OnJanuary 26, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court ente
red a written order denying the Renewed 7023 Motion.De-energization Class Action
On October 25, 2019, a purported securit
ies class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled Vataj v. Johnson et al
. The complaint named as de fendants a current director and certain current and former officers of PG&E Corporation. Neither PG&E Corporation northe Utility was named as a de
fendant. The complaint alleged materially false and misleading statements regarding PG&E Corporation’s wildfire prevention andsafety protocols and polic
ies, including regarding the Utility’s public safety power shutoffs, that allegedly resulted in losses and damages to holders of PG&ECorporation’s securities. Th
e complaint asserted claims under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5promulgated thereunder, 
and sought unspecified monetary relief, attorneys’ fees and other costs. On February 3, 2020, the District Court granted a stipulationappointing Iron Workers Loca
l 580 Joint Funds, Ironworkers Locals 40, 361 & 417 Union Security Funds and Robert Allustiarti co-lead plaintiffs and approvingthe selection of the pl
aintiffs’ counsel, and further ordered the parties to submit a proposed schedule by February 13, 2020. On February 20, 2020, the DistrictCourt issued a scheduling order th
at required the amended complaint to be filed by April 17, 2020.On April 17, 2020, the plaintiffs fi
led an amended complaint asserting the same claims. The amended complaint added PG&E Corporation and a former officer ofPG&E Corporation as defendants, and no longe
r asserts claims against the other two officers of PG&E Corporation previously named in the action.On May 15, 2020 the officer defendan
ts filed their motion to dismiss in Vataj . On June 19, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed its opposition to the motion to dismiss. OnJuly 10, 2020 the officer defend
ants filed their reply. In October 2020, the parties reached a settlement agreement in principle, and on October 29, 2020, filed ajoint notice of settlement, i
nforming the District Court that they have agreed in principle to settle the matter.On February 16, 2021, plaintiffs fil
ed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement with the District Court, and the District Court issued an order terminatingas moot the pending motion to dis
miss, without prejudice. Pursuant to the settlement stipulation, subject to certain conditions: (1) PG&E Corporation will pay$10 million into an inter
est-bearing escrow account within 14 days after the District Court’s preliminary approval of the settlement; and (2) plaintiffs and theSettlement Class (as def
ined in the stipulation of settlement) will release the Released Persons (as defined the stipulation of settlement, including PG&ECorporation and the Utility, and 
each of their officers, directors, as well as the current and former officers named in both the original and amended complaints)from all claims th
at have been or could have been asserted by or on behalf of PG&E Corporation shareholders that relate to (a) allegations that were asserted orcould have been asserted in 
either of the complaints in Vataj , and (b) investments in PG&E Corporat ion’s stock during the relevant period specified in thestipulated settlement.
The settlement is subject t
o the District Court’s approval and its terms may change as a result of the settlement approval process. The preliminary settlementapproval hearing is curr
ently scheduled for March 11, 2021. The final approval hearing is not yet scheduled. If the District Court approves the settlement and entersa judgment substantially
 in the form requested by the parties, the settlement will become effective when certain conditions specified in the settlement stipulationare satisfied, includ
ing the expiration of any right to appeal the judgment.188

Indemnification ObligationsTo the extent permitt
ed by law, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have obligations to indemnify directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while adirector or office
r is or was serving in such capacity, which indemnification obligations extend to the claims asserted against the directors and officers in thesecurities class ac
tion. PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage to reduce their exposure to such indemnificationobligations. PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity have provided notice to their insurance carriers of the claims asserted in the wildfire-related securities class actionsand derivative litigation, a
nd are in communication with the carriers regarding the applicability of the directors and officers insurance policies to those matters.PG&E Corporation and the Utility addi
tionally have potential indemnification obligations to the underwriters for the Utility’s note offerings, pursuant to theunderwriting agreements 
associated with those offerings. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s indemnification obligations to the officers, directors andunderwriters may be lim
ited or affected by the Chapter 11 Cases.District Attorneys’ Offi
ces InvestigationsFollowing the 2018 Camp fire, the Butte County Dis
trict Attorney’s Office and the California Attorney General’s Office opened a criminal investigation of the2018 Camp fire. PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity were informed by the Butte County District Attorney’s Office and the California Attorney General’s Office thata grand jury had been empane
led in Butte County.On March 17, 2020, the Utility enter
ed into the Plea Agreement and Settlement (the “Plea Agreement”) with the People of the State of California, by and throughthe Butte County District Attorney
’s office (the “People” and the “Butte DA,” respectively) to resolve the criminal prosecution of the Utility in connection with the2018 Camp fire. Subject to the t
erms and conditions of the Plea Agreement, the Utility agreed to plead guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in violationof Penal Code section 192(b) and one coun
t of unlawfully causing a fire in violation of Penal Code section 452, and to admit special allegations pursuant to PenalCode sections 452.1(a)(2), 452.1(a)
(3) and 452.1(a)(4).Per the Plea Agreement, the Ut
ility was sentenced to pay the maximum total fine and penalty of approximately $3.5 million. The Utility also agreed to pay$500,000 to the Butte County District Attorn
ey Environmental and Consumer Protection Fund to reimburse costs spent on the investigation of the 2018 Camp fire.Simultaneous with entry into th
e Plea Agreement, the Utility has committed to spend up to $15 million over five years to provide water to Butte County residentsimpacted by damage to th
e Utility’s Miocene Canal caused by the 2018 Camp fire. In addition, the Utility has consented to the Butte District Attorney’s consulting,sharing information with and 
receiving information from the Monitor overseeing the Utility’s probation related to the San Bruno explosion through the expirationof the Utility’s term o
f probation and in no event until later than January 31, 2022.On June 16, 2020 through June 18, 2020, the Butte County Superior Court he
ld proceedings at which the Utility pled guilty and was sentenced according to theterms of the Plea Agreem
ent. On July 21, 2020, the Utility paid the $3.5 million fine and penalty to the Butte County Superior Court and $500,000 to the ButteCounty District Attorney Environmen
tal and Consumer Protection Fund.On January 15, 2021, the Butte County Superior Court held 
a brief hearing on the status of restitution, which involves distribution of funds from the Fire VictimTrust, which was established under th
e Company’s Plan of Reorganization in Bankruptcy Court and is managed by a Trustee and a Claims Administrator. TheCourt continued the hearing to August 20, 2021 
for a further update.Cal Fire announced that it had d
etermined that “the Kincade Fire was caused by electrical transmission lines owned and operated by Pacific Gas and Electric(PG&E) located northeast of Geys
erville. Tinder dry vegetation and strong winds combined with low humidity and warm temperatures contributed to extreme ratesof fire spread.” Cal Fire 
also indicated that its investigative report has been forwarded to the Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office, which is currentlyconducting an investigation o
f the fire. On February 24, 2021, the Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office sent a search warrant to the Utility through its counselin connection with the invest
igation. The Utility expects to produce documents and respond to other requests for information in connection with the investigationand the search warrant. For mo
re information see “2019 Kincade Fire” above.The Shasta County District Attorney’s Of
fice is investigating the 2020 Zogg fire. See “2020 Zogg Fire” above for further information.189

Additional investigations and other actions may arise out of the 2019 Kincade fire or the 2020 Zogg fire. The timing and outcome for resolution of any suchinvestigations are uncertain.
SEC Investigation
On March 20, 2019, PG&E Corporation learned tha
t the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office was conducting an investigation related to PG&E Corporation’s andthe Utility’s public disc
losures and accounting for losses associated with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire.PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e unable to predict the timing and outcome of the investigation.Wildfire Fund under AB 1054
On July 12, 2019, the California governor sign
ed into law AB 1054, a bill which provides for the establishment of a statewide fund that will be available foreligible electric utility companies t
o pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12, 2019 that are caused by the applicable electricutility company’s equipm
ent, subject to the terms and conditions of AB 1054. Eligible claims are claims for third party damages resulting from any such wildfires,limited to the portion o
f such claims that exceeds the greater of (i) $1.0 billion in the aggregate in any year and (ii) the amount of insurance coverage required to bein place for the ele
ctric utility company pursuant to Section 3293 of the Public Utilities Code, added by AB 1054.Electric utility 
companies that draw from the Wildfire Fund will only be required to repay amounts that are determined by the CPUC in an application for costrecovery not to be just and r
easonable, subject to a rolling three-year disallowance cap equal to 20% of the electric utility company’s transmission and distributionequity rate base. For the Uti
lity, this disallowance cap is expected to be approximately $2.7 billion for the three-year period starting in 2019, subject to adjustmentbased on changes in the Utility
’s total transmission and distribution equity rate base. The disallowance cap is inapplicable in certain circumstances, including if theWildfire Fund administrator
 determines that the electric utility company’s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted “conscious orwillful disregard for th
e rights and safety of others,” or the electric utility company fails to maintain a valid safety certification. Costs that the CPUC determines tobe just and reasonable will no
t need to be repaid to the Wildfire Fund, resulting in a draw-down of the Wildfire Fund.On August 23, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s Initia
l Safety Certification, which under AB 1054 entitles the Utility to certain benefits, including eligibilityfor a cap on Wildfire F
und reimbursement and for a reformed prudent manager standard. The Utility satisfied the required elements for its Initial Safety Certificate,as follows: (i) the ele
ctrical corporation has an approved WMP, (ii) the electrical corporation is in good standing, which can be satisfied by the electricalcorporation having agree
d to implement the findings of its most recent safety culture assessment, if applicable, (iii) the electrical corporation has established asafety committee of its board
 of directors composed of members with relevant safety experience, and (iv) the electrical corporation has established board-of-director-level r
eporting to the CPUC on safety issues. Before the expiration of any current safety certification, the Utility must request a new safety certification forthe following 12 months, which shall be 
issued within 90 days if the Utility has provided documentation that it has satisfied the requirements for the safetycertification pursu
ant to Section 8389(e) of the Public Utilities Code, added by AB 1054. On July 29, 2020, the Utility submitted its application for a new safetycertification. On Janua
ry 14, 2021, the WSD approved the Utility’s 2020 application and issued the Utility’s 2020 Safety Certification pursuant to the requirementsof AB 1054. The safety certific
ation is separate from the CPUC’s enforcement authority and does not preclude the CPUC from pursuing remedies for safety orother applicable viol
ations. The 2020 Safety Certification is valid for 12 months or until a timely request for a new safety certification is acted upon, whicheveroccurs later. On January 26, 2021, TURN filed with 
the CPUC a request for review of WSD’s issuance of the safety certification.The Wildfire Fund and disallowan
ce cap will be terminated when the amounts therein are exhausted. The Wildfire Fund is expected to be capitalized with (i)$10.5 billion of proceeds of bonds support
ed by a 15-year extension of the Department of Water Resources charge to ratepayers, (ii) $7.5 billion in initialcontributions from Califo
rnia’s three IOU companies and (iii) $300 million in annual contributions paid by California’s three IOU companies for at least a 10 yearperiod. The contributions fro
m the IOU companies will be effectively borne by their respective shareholders, as they will not be permitted to recover these costsfrom ratepayers. The cos
ts of the initial and annual contributions are allocated among the three IOU companies pursuant to a “Wildfire Fund allocation metric” setforth in AB 1054 based on land area in th
e applicable utility’s service territory classified as high fire threat districts and adjusted to account for risk mitigationefforts. The Utility’s W
ildfire Fund allocation metric is 64.2% (representing an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and annual contributions ofapproximately $193 mill
ion). The Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in theWildfire Fund. Such funds could be depl
eted more quickly than expected, including as a result of claims made by California’s other participating electric utilitycompanies.
190

AB 1054 also provides that the first $5.0 billion expended in the aggregate by California’s three IOU companies on fire risk mitigation capital expendituresincluded in their respe
ctive approved WMPs will be excluded from their respective equity rate bases. The $5.0 billion of capital expenditures will be allocatedamong the IOU companies in acco
rdance with their Wildfire Fund allocation metrics (described above). The Utility’s allocation is $3.21 billion. AB 1054contemplates that such 
capital expenditures may be securitized through a customer charge.On the Effective Date, having s
atisfied the conditions for the Utility’s initial participation in the Wildfire Fund, PG&E Corporation and the Utility contributed, inaccordance with AB 1054, an initia
l contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and first annual contribution of approximately $193 million to the Wildfire Fund tosecure participat
ion of the Utility therein. SDG&E and Edison made their initial contributions to the Wildfire Fund in September 2019. On December 30, 2020, theUtility made its second annu
al contribution of $193 million to the Wildfire Fund.As of the Effective Date, th
e Wildfire Fund became available to the Utility to pay for eligible claims arising on or after the effective date of AB 1054, July 12,2019, subject to a limit of 40
% of the amount of allowed claims arising between the effective date of AB 1054 and the Effective Date of the Plan.For additional informat
ion on the Wildfire Fund, see Note 3 above.NOTE 15: OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND 
COMMITMENTSPG&E Corporation and the Utility have s
ignificant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to enforcement and litigationmatters and environmen
tal remediation.  A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of theloss can be reasonably esti
mated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lowerend of the range, unless an amoun
t within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonablypossible, and whether the loss or a 
range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies are reviewedquarterly and estima
tes are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, penaltiesrelated to regulato
ry compliance, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’spolicy is to exclude anti
cipated legal costs from the provision for loss and expense these costs as incurred. The Utility also has substantial financial commitmentsin connection with agreem
ents entered into to support its operating activities.  See “Purchase Commitments” below.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility havefinancial commit
ments described in “Other Commitments” below.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, andcash flows may be materiall
y affected by the outcome of the following matters.Enforcement Matters
U.S. District Court Matters and Probation
In connection with the Utili
ty’s probation proceeding, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California has the ability to impose additionalprobation conditions on the Util
ity. Additional conditions, if implemented, could be wide-ranging and would impact the Utility’s operations, number of employees,costs and financial per
formance. Depending on the terms of these additional requirements, costs in connections with such requirements could have a material effecton PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.CPUC and FERC Matters
Order Instituting Investigation into the 2017 Northern California Wildf
ires and the 2018 Camp FireOn June 27, 2019, the CPUC issued the Wildfires OII to de
termine whether the Utility “violated any provision(s) of the California Public Utilities Code (PUCode), Commission General Orders (GO) or de
cisions, or other applicable rules or requirements pertaining to the maintenance and operation of its electric facilitiesthat were involved in ignit
ing fires in its service territory in 2017.” On December 5, 2019, the assigned commissioner issued a second amended scoping memo andruling that amended the s
cope of issues to be considered in this proceeding to include the 2018 Camp fire.As previously disclosed, on December 17, 2019, 
the Utility, the SED of the CPUC, the CPUC’s OSA, and CUE jointly submitted to the CPUC a proposedsettlement agree
ment in connection with this proceeding and jointly moved for its approval.191

Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Utility agreed to (i) not seek rate recovery of wildfire-related expenses and capital expenditures in future applications inthe amount of $1.625 billion, as spe
cified below, and (ii) incur costs of $50 million in shareholder-funded system enhancement initiatives as described further inthe settlement agreement. The 
settlement agreement stipulates that no violations have been identified in the Tubbs fire. While, as a result of this finding, thesettlement agree
ment does not prevent the Utility from seeking recovery of costs associated with the Tubbs fire through rates, the Utility has committed not to seekrate recovery for th
e Tubbs fire except through securitization. The amounts set forth in the table below include actual recorded costs and forecasted cost estimatesas of the date of the set
tlement agreement for expenses and capital expenditures which the Utility has incurred or planned to incur to comply with its legalobligations to provi
de safe and reliable service. While actual costs incurred for certain cost categories are different than what was assumed in the settlementagreement, the Utili
ty has recorded $1.625 billion of the disallowed costs through December 31, 2020.(in millions)

the system enhancement spending pursuant to the settlement agreement will occur through 2025.On April 20, 2020, the assigned commissione
r issued a Decision Different adopting, with changes, the proposed modifications set forth in the request for review.The Decision Different (i
) increases the amount of disallowed wildfire expenditures by $198 million (as set forth in the POD); (ii) increases the amount ofshareholder funding for System Enh
ancement Initiatives by $64 million (as set forth in the POD); (iii) imposes a $200 million fine but permanently suspendspayment of the fine; and 
(iii) limits the tax savings that must be returned to ratepayers to those savings generated by disallowed operating expenditures. TheDecision Different also den
ies all pending appeals of the POD and denies, in part, the Utility’s motion requesting other relief. On April 30, 2020, the Utilitysubmitted its comments on 
the Decision Different to the CPUC, accepting the modifications. The CPUC approved the Decision Different on May 7, 2020.The settlement agre
ement, as modified by the Decision Different, became effective upon: (i) approval by the CPUC in the Decision Different, (ii) following suchapproval by the CPUC, the June 20, 2020 approval of the Bank
ruptcy Court, and (iii) the July 1, 2020 effectiveness of the Plan.As it relates to the addi
tional $198 million in disallowed costs as adopted in the Decision Different, the Utility has recorded charges of $152 million primarily inWMPMA
 as of December 31, 2020 and intends to record the remaining charges of $46 million in 2021.On June 8, 2020, two parties filed separ
ate applications for rehearing, the purpose of which was to challenge the CPUC’s approval of the settlement agreement, asmodified. On June 23, 2020, the Utility and CUE fi
led a joint response opposing the Applications for Rehearing. On December 3, 2020, the CPUC issued adecision denying the applic
ation for rehearing. On January 4, 2021, one party filed a petition for review of the CPUC decision with the California court of appeals.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing and outcome of the petition.(1)(2)

Transmission Owner Rate Case Revenue Subject to RefundThe FERC determines the amount of au
thorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect inrates in the TO rate cas
e. The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on the requested revenue requirement, subject to refund, before theFERC has issued a final decision. The Util
ity bills and records revenue based on the amounts requested in its rate case filing and records a reserve for its estimateof the amounts that are p
robable of refund. Rates subject to refund went into effect on March 1, 2017, March 1, 2018, and May 1, 2019 for TO18, TO19, andTO20, respectively.
On October 1, 2018, the ALJ issued an initial d
ecision in the TO18 rate case and the Utility filed initial briefs on October 31, 2018, in response to the ALJ’srecommendations. On October 15, 2020, th
e FERC issued an order that affirmed in part and reversed in part the initial decision. The order reopens the record forthe limited purpose of a
llowing the participants to this proceeding an opportunity to present written evidence concerning the FERC’s revised ROE methodologyadopted in the FERC Opinion No. 569-A, issued on May 21, 2020, that ref
ined the methodology it established in Opinion No. 569 for setting the ROE that electricutilities are autho
rized to earn on electric transmission investments. Initial briefs were filed December 14, 2020 and reply briefs were filed February 12, 2021. Inaddition, the order approves d
epreciation rates that yield an estimated composite depreciation rate of 2.94% compared to the Utility’s request of 3.25%. Further, thedecision reduces forec
asted capital, operations and maintenance, and cost of debt expense to actual costs incurred for the rate case period. Finally, the order upheldthe initial decision
’s rejection of the Utility’s direct assignment of common plant to FERC and required the allocation of all common plant between CPUC andFERC jurisdiction be based on operating 
and maintenance labor ratios. Application of the operating and maintenance labor rates would result in an allocation of6.15% of common plant to FERC in comparison 
to 8.84% under the Utility’s direct assignment method. The Utility filed a request for rehearing of certain aspectsof the order, which was denied by the FERC on Decemb
er 17, 2020. The Utility filed a petition for review of the order on February 11, 2021, and a separatepetition for review was join
tly filed the same day by two other parties. The ultimate outcome of the items for which the Utility requested rehearing could alsoimpact the revenues r
ecorded for the TO19 and TO20 periods.On September 21, 2018, the Utility fi
led an all-party settlement with the FERC, which was approved by the FERC on December 20, 2018, in connection withTO19. As part of the settlement, 
the TO19 revenue requirement will be set at 98.85% of the revenue requirement for TO18 that will be determined upon issuanceof a final unappealabl
e decision in TO18.The Utility is unable to pred
ict the timing or outcome of the FERC’s decisions in the TO18 proceeding.Other Matters
PG&E Corporation and the Utility ar
e subject to various claims and lawsuits that separately are not considered material.  Accruals for contingencies related to suchmatters (excluding a
mounts related to the contingencies discussed above under “Enforcement and Litigation Matters”) totaled $144 million and $116 million atDecember 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, r
espectively. These amounts were included in LSTC at December 31, 2019 and were included in Other currentliabilities at Dec
ember 31, 2020. PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe it is reasonably possible that the resolution of these matters will have a materialimpact on their finan
cial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.PSPS Class Action
On December 19, 2019, a complaint was f
iled in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California naming PG&E Corporation and theUtility. The plaintiff s
eeks certification of a class consisting of all California residents and business owners who had their power shut off by the Utility during theOctober 9, October 23, October 26, October 28, o
r November 20, 2019 power outages and any subsequent voluntary outages occurring during the course oflitigation. The plaint
iff alleges that the necessity for the October and November 2019 power shutoff events was caused by the Utility’s negligence in failing toproperly maintain its 
electrical lines and surrounding vegetation. The complaint seeks up to $2.5 billion in special and general damages, punitive and exemplarydamages and injunctive r
elief to require the Utility to properly maintain and inspect its power grid. PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe the allegations arewithout merit and intend to d
efend this lawsuit vigorously.On January 21, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
filed a motion to dismiss the complaint or in the alternative strike the class action allegations. The motionto dismiss and strike was heard by 
the Bankruptcy Court on March 10, 2020, and on April 3, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order dismissing the actionwithout leave to amend, find
ing that the action was preempted under the California Public Utilities Code.193

On March 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court issued an opinion granting the Utility's motion to dismiss this class action. The court held that the plaintiff’s class actionclaims are preemp
ted as a matter of law by section 1759 of the California Public Utilities Code and thus the plaintiffs could not pursue civil damages. The courtstated that “any cla
im for damages caused by PSPS events approved by the CPUC, even if based on pre-existing events that may or may not have contributed to thenecessity of the PSPS events, would interf
ere with the CPUC’s policy-making decisions.”On April 6, 2020, the plaintiff fi
led a notice of appeal of the Bankruptcy Court decision dismissing the complaint. The plaintiff has elected to have the appeal heardby the District Court, rathe
r than the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel. The plaintiff filed a designation of the record and statement of the issues on April 20, 2020.On June 8, 2020, the plaintiff fil
ed its opening brief with the District Court. The Utility filed its opposition brief on July 6, 2020. The plaintiff’s reply brief wasfiled on August 4, 2020 with a request for o
ral argument. On October 20, 2020, the District Court denied the plaintiff’s request for oral argument and stated that ifit wants to hear oral argu
ment, it will inform the parties and schedule a hearing.The Utility is unable to det
ermine the timing and outcome of this proceeding.GT&S Capital Expenditures 2011-2014
On June 23, 2016, the CPUC approved a final phase one decis
ion in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case.  The phase one decision excluded from rate base$696 million of capital sp
ending in 2011 through 2014 in excess of the amount adopted in the prior GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed$120 million of that amount 
and ordered that the remaining $576 million be subject to a review of reasonableness to be conducted, or overseen, by the CPUC staff.The review was completed on June 1, 2020 and d
id not result in any additional disallowances. The report certified $512 million for future recovery. The differencebetween the certifi
ed amount and the $576 million previously disallowed is primarily a result of differences between capital expenditures forecasted in the 2015GT&S rate case and recorded 
capital expenditures.On July 31, 2020, the Utility filed an app
lication seeking recovery of revenue requirements on the $512 million of capital expenditures retroactive to January 1,2015. On October 16, 2020, the assigned commission
er issued a scoping memo establishing the scope and schedule for the proceeding. On January 20, 2021, theUtility provided supplement
al testimony and supporting working papers addressing the reasonableness of the capital expenditures. The scoping memo calls for theissuance of a proposed decision 
in the fourth quarter of 2021.The Utility is unable to det
ermine the timing and outcome of this proceeding.CZU Lightning Complex Fire Notices of Violation
Several governmental en
tities have raised concerns regarding the Utility’s emergency response to the 2020 CZU Lightning Complex fire, including Cal Firealleging violations of Publi
c Resource Code sections related to timber harvest regulations and Forest Practice Rules, the California Coastal Commission allegingviolations of the Coastal Act 
related to unpermitted development in the coastal zone, the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board alleging unpermitteddischarge to waters, and the San
ta Cruz County Board of Supervisors adopting a resolution to file a complaint with the CPUC. The concerns include potentialenvironmental impac
ts related to erosion and sedimentation from hazard tree removal and access road use, work in sensitive habitats, and the management of wooddebris. The Coastal Commission issued 
a Notice of Violation letter to the Utility on November 20, 2020, the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Boardissued a Notice of Violation l
etter on December 15, 2020, Cal Fire has issued five Notices of Violation through February 8, 2021, and Santa Cruz County filed acomplaint with the CPUC on January 25, 2021. The Utili
ty continues to work with all agencies, as well as Santa Cruz County, to resolve any outstanding issues.Based on the information cur
rently available, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that a liability has been incurred. The Utility is unable toreasonably estimate 
the amount or range of potential penalties that could be incurred given the number of factors that can be considered in determining penalties.PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not be
lieve that the resolution of these matters will have a material impact on their financial condition, results of operations,or cash flows. Violations can resu
lt in penalties, remediation and other relief.194

Environmental Remediation ContingenciesGiven the complexities of 
the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process forestimating remediation liabilities req
uires significant judgment. The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when the site assessments indicate thatremediation is probabl
e, and the Utility can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of probable amounts. The Utility records an environmental remediation liabilitybased on the lower end of the rang
e of estimated probable costs, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Key factors thatinform the development of
 estimated costs include site feasibility studies and investigations, applicable remediation actions, operations and maintenance activities,post-remediation moni
toring, and the cost of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site. Amounts recorded are not discounted to theirpresent value. The Utility
’s environmental remediation liability is primarily included in non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is comprisedof the following:

 Primarily driven by the San Francisco Potrero Power Plant.
The Utility’s gas compressor s
tations, former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, and sites used by the Utility for the storage,recycling, and disposal of pot
entially hazardous substances are subject to requirements issued by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal ResourceConservation and Recovery Act in addi
tion to other state hazardous waste laws.  The Utility has a comprehensive program in place designed to comply withfederal, state, and local la
ws and regulations related to hazardous materials, waste, remediation activities, and other environmental requirements.  The Utilityassesses and monitors the envi
ronmental requirements on an ongoing basis and implements changes to its program as deemed appropriate. The Utility’sremediation activ
ities are overseen by the DTSC, several California regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.The Utility’s environme
ntal remediation liability at December 31, 2020, reflects its best estimate of probable future costs for remediation based on the currentassessment data and regul
atory obligations. Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work necessary to implement final remediation plans,the Utility’s time frame for remediati
on, and unanticipated claims filed against the Utility.  The Utility may incur actual costs in the future that are materiallydifferent than this es
timate and such costs could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows during the period in which theyare recorded. At Decembe
r 31, 2020, the Utility expected to recover $986 million of its environmental remediation liability for certain sites through variousratemaking mechanis
ms authorized by the CPUC. Natural Gas Compressor Station Sites
The Utility is legally r
esponsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gascompressor stations. The Util
ity is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment.(1)(2)

Topock SiteThe Utility’s remedia
tion and abatement efforts at the Topock site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California DTSC and the U.S. Department of theInterior. On April 24, 2018, the DTSC authorized 
the Utility to build an in-situ groundwater treatment system to convert hexavalent chromium into a non-toxic andnon-soluble form of chromiu
m. Construction activities began in October 2018 and will continue for several years. The Utility’s undiscounted future costsassociated with the Topock sit
e may increase by as much as $216 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. Thecosts associated with environ
mental remediation at the Topock site are expected to be recovered primarily through the HSM, where 90% of the costs are recoveredin rates.
Hinkley Site
The Utility has been imple
menting remediation measures at the Hinkley site to reduce the mass of the chromium plume in groundwater and to monitor and controlmovement of the plume. The Ut
ility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California Regional WaterQuality Control Board, Lahontan Region. In Novemb
er 2015, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region adopted a clean-up andabatement order directing the 
Utility to contain and remediate the underground plume of hexavalent chromium and the potential environmental impacts. The finalorder states that the Ut
ility must continue and improve its remediation efforts, define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take other action. Additionally,the final order sets plu
me capture requirements, requires a monitoring and reporting program, and includes deadlines for the Utility to meet interim cleanup targets.The United States Geological Survey 
team is currently conducting a background study on the site to better define the chromium plume boundaries. A draftbackground report was receiv
ed in January 2020 and is expected to be finalized in 2021. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Hinkley sitemay increase by as much as $138 
million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs associated withenvironmental remed
iation at the Hinkley site will not be recovered through rates.Former Manufactured Gas Plants
Former MGPs used coal and oil to produce g
as for use by the Utility’s customers before natural gas became available. The by-products and residues of this processwere often disposed of at the MGPs the
mselves. The Utility has a program to manage the residues left behind as a result of the manufacturing process; many of thesites in the program have b
een addressed. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with MGP sites may increase by as much as $460 million if the extentof contamination or neces
sary remediation at currently identified MGP sites is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation at theMGP sites are recovered through 
the HSM, where 90% of the costs are recovered in rates.Utility-Owned Generation Facilities and Third-Part
y Disposal SitesUtility-owned generation f
acilities and third-party disposal sites often involve long-term remediation. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated withUtility-owned generation f
acilities and third-party disposal sites may increase by as much as $67 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation isgreater than anticipated. The
 environmental remediation costs associated with the Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites are recoveredthrough the HSM, where 90% of the costs ar
e recovered in rates.Fossil Fuel-Fired Generation Sites
In 1998, the Utility divested i
ts generation power plant business as part of generation deregulation. Although the Utility sold its fossil-fueled power plants, theUtility retained the 
environmental remediation liability associated with each site. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with fossil fuel-fired generationsites may increase by as
 much as $43 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The environmental remediationcosts associated with the foss
il fuel-fired sites will not be recovered through rates.Nuclear Insurance
The Utility maintains mu
ltiple insurance policies through NEIL, a mutual insurer owned by utilities with nuclear facilities, and EMANI, covering nuclear or non-nuclear events at the Ut
ility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired Humboldt Bay Unit 3.  196

NEIL provides insurance coverage for property damages and business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur atthe Utility’s two nuclear g
enerating units at Diablo Canyon. NEIL provides property damage and business interruption coverage of up to $3.2 billion per nuclearincident and $2.7 billion per non
-nuclear incident for Diablo Canyon. For Humboldt Bay Unit 3, NEIL provides up to $50 million of coverage for nuclear and non-nuclear property damages.
NEIL also provides coverage for d
amages caused by acts of terrorism at nuclear power plants. Through NEIL, there is up to $3.2 billion available to themembership to cover this 
exposure. This coverage amount is shared by all NEIL members and applies to all terrorist acts occurring within a 12-month periodagainst one or more comm
ercial nuclear power plants insured by NEIL.In addition to the nuclea
r insurance the Utility maintains through NEIL, the Utility also is a member of EMANI, which provides excess insurance coverage forproperty damages and business in
terruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur at Diablo Canyon. EMANI provides anadditional $200 million fo
r any one accident and in the annual aggregate excess of the combined amount recoverable under the Utility’s NEIL policies.If NEIL losses in any policy year 
exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment.  If NEIL were to exercise this assessment,the maximum aggregat
e annual retrospective premium obligation for the Utility would be approximately $43 million.  If EMANI losses in any policy year exceedaccumulated funds, the Uti
lity could be subject to a retrospective assessment of approximately $4 million. Under the Price-Anderson Act, public 
liability claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur at Diablo Canyon, and that occur during the transportation ofmaterial to and fro
m Diablo Canyon are limited to approximately $13.8 billion. The Utility purchases the maximum available public liability insurance of$450 million for Diablo Canyon. The bal
ance of the $13.8 billion of liability protection is provided under a loss-sharing program among utilities owning nuclearreactors. The Utility m
ay be assessed up to $275 million per nuclear incident under this loss sharing program, with payments in each year limited to a maximum of$41 million per incident. Both 
the maximum assessment and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years.The Price-Anderson Act does not apply to 
claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur during shipping of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel enricher to afuel fabricator or that occur at
 the fuel fabricator’s facility. The Utility has a separate policy that provides coverage for claims arising from some of these incidentsup to a maximum of $450 mill
ion per incident. In addition, the Utility has approximately $53 million of liability insurance for Humboldt Bay Unit 3 and has a$500 million indemnific
ation from the NRC for public liability arising from nuclear incidents for Humboldt Bay Unit 3, covering liabilities in excess of the$53 million in liabili
ty insurance.Diablo Canyon Outages
Diablo Canyon Unit 2 has experienced fou
r outages between July 2020 and February 24, 2021, each due or related to malfunctions within the main generatorassociated with excessive v
ibrations. Additional inspections and replacement of a redesigned component of the generator are expected to occur during Unit 2’splanned spring 2021 refueling out
age. The affected component is part of the secondary system and does not involve a risk of release of radioactive material into theenvironment. The Utility is work
ing with the vendor that supplied the affected component to understand the root cause and to develop appropriate correctiveactions.
If additional shutdowns occur in 
the future, or if the planned refueling outage is extended due to the inspections and replacement of the affected component, theUtility may incur incr
emental costs or forgo additional power market revenues. The Utility will also be subject to a review of the reasonableness of its actionsbefore the CPUC.
Diablo Canyon carries property d
amage and outage insurance issued by NEIL. The Utility has notified NEIL of its potential claims for loss recovery.The Utility is unable to re
asonably estimate the occurrence or length of future outages, the cost to repair the generator, the loss of power market revenues, or theresults of a reasonablen
ess review by the CPUC.197

In the ordinary course of busin
ess, the Utility enters into various agreements, including renewable energy agreements, QF agreements, and other power purchaseagreements to purchase powe
r and electric capacity.  The price of purchased power may be fixed or variable.  Variable pricing is generally based on the currentmarket price of either natural ga
s or electricity at the date of delivery.Renewable Energy
 Power Purchase Agreements.  In order to comply with Califo rnia’s RPS requirements, the Utility is required to deliver renewable energy to itscustomers at a gradual
ly increasing rate.  The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase renewable energy to help meet California’s requirement. TheUtility’s obligations under 
a significant portion of these agreements are contingent on the third party’s construction of new generation facilities, which are expectedto grow.  As of December 31, 2020, renewable en
ergy contracts expire at various dates between 2021 and 2043.Conventional Energy Power Purchase Agreements. 
 The Utility has entered in to many power purchase agreements for conventional generation resources, whichinclude tolling agree
ments and resource adequacy agreements.  The Utility’s obligation under a portion of these agreements is contingent on the third parties’development of new generat
ion facilities to provide capacity and energy products to the Utility. As of December 31, 2020, these power purchase agreements expireat various dates between 2021 and 2033.
Other Power Purchase Agreements. 
 The Utility has entered in to agreements to purchase energy and capacity with independent power producers that owngeneration facili
ties that meet the definition of a QF under federal law. As of December 31, 2020, QF contracts in operation expire at various dates between 2021and 2049.  In addition, the Utility h
as agreements with various irrigation districts and water agencies to purchase hydroelectric power.The net costs incurred for 
all power purchases and electric capacity amounted to $2.9 billion in 2020, $3.0 billion in 2019, and $3.1 billion in 2018.Natural Gas Supply, Transportation, and Storage Commitments 
The Utility purchases natur
al gas directly from producers and marketers in both Canada and the United States to serve its core customers and to fuel its owned-generation facili
ties.  The Utility also contracts for natural gas transportation from the points at which the Utility takes delivery (typically in Canada, the US RockyMountain supply area, and the southwes
tern United States) to the points at which the Utility’s natural gas transportation system begins.  These agreements expire atvarious dates between 2021 and 2026.  In add
ition, the Utility has contracted for natural gas storage services in northern California to more reliably meetcustomers’ loads.
Costs incurred for natural g
as purchases, natural gas transportation services, and natural gas storage, which include contracts with terms of less than 1 year,amounted to $0.8 billion in 2020, $0.9 bil
lion in 2019, and $0.6 billion in 2018.198

Nuclear Fuel AgreementsThe Utility has entered in
to several purchase agreements for nuclear fuel.  These agreements expire at various dates between 2021 and 2024 and are intended toensure long-term nucle
ar fuel supply.  The Utility relies on a number of international producers of nuclear fuel in order to diversify its sources and provide securityof supply.  Pricing terms are 
also diversified, ranging from market-based prices to base prices that are escalated using published indices. Payments for nuclear fue
l amounted to $111 million in 2020, $74 million in 2019, and $73 million in 2018.Other Commitments
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have o
ther commitments primarily related to office facilities and land leases, which expire at various dates between 2021 and2052.  At December 31, 2020, the future m

increases in rent.  The rents may increase by a fixed amount each year, a percentage of the base rent, or the consumer price index.  Thereare options to extend these 
leases for one  to five years.One of these commitments 
is treated as a financing lease. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, net financing leases reflected in property, plant, and equipment on theConsolidated Balance Sheets were $7 
million and $9 million including accumulated amortization of $11 million and $9 million, respectively.  The present value ofthe future minimum l
ease payments due under these agreements included $2 million and $2 million in Current Liabilities and $5 million and $7 million inNoncurrent Liabilities on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Oakland Headquarters Lease
On June 5, 2020, the Utility entered in
to an Agreement to Enter Into Lease and Purchase Option (the “Agreement”) with TMG Bay Area Investments II, LLC(“TMG”). The Agreement provides 
that, contingent on (i) entry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court authorizing the Utility to enter into the Agreement and theLease Agreement (as def
ined below), subject to certain conditions, and (ii) acquisition of the Lakeside Building by BA2 300 Lakeside LLC (“Landlord”), a whollyowned subsidiary of TMG, the Utility and Land
lord will enter into an office lease agreement (the “Lease Agreement”) for approximately 910,000 rentable squarefeet of space within the bu
ilding located at the Lakeside Building to serve as the Utility’s principal administrative headquarters (the “Lease”). On June 9, 2020,PG&E Corporation and the Utility fi
led a motion with the Bankruptcy Court authorizing them to enter into the Agreement and grant related relief. The BankruptcyCourt entered an order approv
ing the motion on June 24, 2020.Pursuant to the terms of the Agr
eement, concurrent with the Landlord’s acquisition of the Lakeside Building, on October 23, 2020, the Utility and the Landlordentered into the Lease, 
and the Utility issued to Landlord (i) an option payment letter of credit in the amount of $75 million, and (ii) and a lease security letter ofcredit in the amount of $75 
million.The term of the Lease wil
l begin on or about March 1, 2022. The Lease term will expire 34 years and 11 months after the commencement date, unless earlierterminated in acco
rdance with the terms of the Lease. In addition to base rent, the Utility will be responsible for certain costs and charges specified in the Lease,including insurance costs, m
aintenance costs and taxes.199

The Lease requires the Landlord to pursue approvals to subdivide the real estate it owns surrounding the Lakeside Building to create a separate legal parcel thatcontains the Lakeside Building 
(the “Property”) that can be sold to the Utility. The Lease grants to the Utility an option to purchase the Property, following suchsubdivision, at a price of $892 m
illion, subject to certain adjustments (the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price would not be paid until 2023.In connection with entry into 
the Agreement, the Utility intends to sell its current office space generally located at 77 Beale Street, 215 Market Street, 245 MarketStreet and 50 Main Street, San Fran
cisco, California 94105, and associated properties owned by the Utility (“SFGO”). Any sale of the SFGO would be subject toapproval by the CPUC. On September 30, 2020, the Utility 
filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization to sell the SFGO.At December 31, 2020, the Lease Agree
ment had no impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements.NOTE 16: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Sale of Transmission Tower Wireless Licenses
On February 16, 2021, the Utility granted 
to a subsidiary of SBA Communications Corporation (such subsidiary, “SBA”) an exclusive license enabling SBA tosublicense and market 
wireless communications equipment attachment locations (“Cell Sites”) on more than 700 of the Utility’s electric transmission towers,telecommunications towers,
 monopoles, buildings or other structures (collectively, the “Effective Date Towers”) to wireless telecommunication carriers(“Carriers”) for attachment of 
wireless communications equipment, as contemplated by a Master Transaction Agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) datedFebruary 2, 2021, between the Utility 
and SBA. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, the Utility also assigned to SBA license agreements between the Utilityand Carriers for substanti
ally all of the existing Cell Sites on the Effective Date Towers.The exclusive license was gr
anted pursuant to a Master Multi-Site License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) between the Utility and SBA. The term of theLicense Agreement is for 100 y
ears. The Utility has the right to terminate the license for individual Cell Sites for certain regulatory or utility operational reasons,with a corresponding payment to SBA. Pursuant to 
the License Agreement, SBA is entitled to the sublicensing revenue generated by new sublicenses of Cell Siteson the Effective Date Towers, sub
ject to the Utility’s right to a percentage of such sublicensing revenue.In exchange for the exclus
ive license and entry into the License Agreement, SBA agreed to pay the Utility a purchase price of $973 million, subject to customaryadjustments. SBA paid the Utility $954 m
illion of such purchase price at the closing pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, which also contemplates the post-closing assignment of addit
ional specified Cell Sites to SBA upon the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions, for which SBA will make additional purchaseprice payments to the Uti
lity. The closing settlement also reflected an adjustment for an estimated amount of payments received by the Utility from Carriers in thepre-closing period that 
are allocable to licenses in the post-closing period, resulting in initial cash proceeds of $945 million. The purchase price is subject to furtheradjustment pursuant to the 
terms of the Transaction Agreement.The Utility and SBA also entered into 
a Master Transmission Tower Site License Agreement (the “Tower Site Agreement”), pursuant to which SBA received theexclusive rights to sublic
ense and market potential additional attachment locations on approximately 28,000 of the Utility’s other electric transmission towers toCarriers for attach
ment of wireless communications equipment. The Tower Site Agreement provides for a split of license fees from Carriers between the Utilityand SBA. The Tower Site Agreement has a lic
ensing period of up to 15 years, depending on SBA’s achievement of certain performance metrics, and any siteslicensed during such licens
ing period will continue to be subject to the Tower Site Agreement for the same term as the License Agreement.MANAGEMENT’S REPORT
 ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGManagement of PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financialreporting and the prepar
ation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Internal controlover financial reporting incl
udes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflectthe transactions and disposi
tions of the assets of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary topermit preparation o
f financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations ofmanagement and direc
tors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use, or
 disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.200

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.Management assessed the e
ffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the criteria established in Internal Control— Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on its assessment and those criteria,management has concluded 
that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independen
t registered public accounting firm, has audited PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s internal control over financialreporting as of December 31, 2020, b
ased on criteria established in Internal Control  — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Com
mission.201

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the shareholders and the Board o
f Directors of PG&E CorporationOpinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of PG&E Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, therelated consolidated s
tatements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, andthe related notes and the
 schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statementspresent fairly, in al
l material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flowsfor each of the three y
ears in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have also audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organiza
tions of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company'sinternal control over 
financial reporting.Emergence from Chapter 11
As discussed in Note 2 to the financi
al statements, the Company emerged from Chapter 11 on July 1, 2020. Under the plan of reorganization, the Company isrequired to comply with ce
rtain terms and conditions as described in Note 2 to the financial statements.Basis for Opinion
These financial stat
ements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statementsbased on our audits. We are a pub
lic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securit
ies laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater
ial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included exam
ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles u
sed and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicate
d below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required tobe communicated to the au
dit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especiallychallenging, subjective, o
r complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, takenas a whole, and we are not, by communi
cating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts ordisclosures to which they rel
ate.202

Regulation and Regulated Operations—Refer to Notes 3, 4 and 14 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter Descrip
tionThe Company’s subsidiary, Pacific Gas 
& Electric Company, follows accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover“revenue requiremen
ts” that have been authorized by the California Public Utility Commission (the “CPUC”) or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission basedon its cost of providing servic
e. Pacific Gas & Electric Company records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not berecorded under accounting p
rinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for nonregulated entities. Pacific Gas & Electric Companycapitalizes and re
cords, as regulatory assets, costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in futurerates.
We identified the impact of rate re
gulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impactedaccount balances and disc
losures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the likelihood of recovery of incurred costs in current or future rates duein part to the uncerta
inty related to future decisions by the rate regulators. This required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate settingprocess due its inherent co
mplexities and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’sconclusions that the costs app
roved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset under GAAP and are recorded at theappropriate amount.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Address
ed in the AuditOur audit procedures
 related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation related to the uncertainty of futuredecisions by the rate regu
lators, and that the costs approved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset and are recorded atthe appropriate amount 
included the following, among others:•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over (1) the evaluation of the likelihood of (a) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets;and (b) regulatory devel
opments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates; (2) management’sdetermination that 
costs approved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset and are recorded at the appropriateamount; and (3) the revi
ew of disclosures related to these matters.•
We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the CPUC for the Company and other public utilities in California, procedural filings, filings made byintervenors, and other publi
cly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the CPUC’s treatment ofsimilar costs under similar circ
umstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset balances forcompleteness.
•
For regulatory matters in process (e.g., applications for cost recovery), we inspected the Company’s filings with the CPUC and the filings with the CPUCby intervenors that may i
mpact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.•
For regulatory assets approved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes, we selected samples of costs and evaluated whether they met the definition of aregulatory asset by compa
ring the costs to the description of the costs approved by a CPUC decision and were recorded at the appropriate amount.•
We evaluated whether the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments,were appropriate and consis
tent with the information obtained in our procedures.203

Common Stock Ownership Restrictions – Deferred Tax Asset Valuation—Refer to Note 6 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter Descrip
tionUnder Section 382 of the Interna

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the shareholders and the Board o
f Directors of Pacific Gas and Electric CompanyOpinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and subsidiaries (the "Utility") as of December 31, 2020 and2019, the related consolida
ted statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period endedDecember 31, 2020, and the rela
ted notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, thefinancial statem
ents present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Utility as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operationsand its cash flows for each of 
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the UnitedStates of America.
We have also audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Utility's internal controlover financial repor
ting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Utility's internal controlover financial reporting.
Emergence from Chapter 11
As discussed in Note 2 to the financi
al statements, the Utility emerged from Chapter 11 on July 1, 2020. Under the plan of reorganization, the Utility is required tocomply with certain te
rms and conditions as described in Note 2 to the financial statements.Basis for Opinion
These financial stat
ements are the responsibility of the Utility's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Utility's financial statements basedon our audits. We are a publi
c accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Utility in accordance with theU.S. federal securities l
aws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater
ial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included exam
ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles u
sed and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicate
d below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required tobe communicated to the au
dit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especiallychallenging, subjective, o
r complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, takenas a whole, and we are not, by communi
cating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts ordisclosures to which they rel
ate.207

Regulation and Regulated Operations—Refer to Notes 3, 4 and 14 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter Descrip
tionThe Utility follows
 accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorizedby the California Public Util
ity Commission (the “CPUC”) or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission based on its cost of providing service. The Utilityrecords assets and liabilitie
s that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited States of America (
“GAAP”) for nonregulated entities. The Utility capitalizes and records, as regulatory assets, costs that would otherwise be charged toexpense if it is probable 
that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.We identified the impact of rate re
gulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impactedaccount balances and disc
losures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the likelihood of recovery of incurred costs in current or future rates duein part to the uncerta
inty related to future decisions by the rate regulators. This required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate settingprocess due its inherent co
mplexities and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’sconclusions that the costs app
roved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset under GAAP and are recorded at theappropriate amount.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Address
ed in the AuditOur audit procedures
 related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation related to the uncertainty of futuredecisions by the rate regu
lators, and that the costs approved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset and are recorded atthe appropriate amount 
included the following, among others:•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over (1) the evaluation of the likelihood of (a) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets;and (b) regulatory devel
opments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates; (2) management’sdetermination that 
costs approved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset and are recorded at the appropriateamount; and (3) the revi
ew of disclosures related to these matters.•
We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the CPUC for the Utility and other public utilities in California, procedural filings, filings made byintervenors, and other publi
cly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the CPUC’s treatment ofsimilar costs under similar circ
umstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset balances forcompleteness.
•
For regulatory matters in process (e.g., applications for cost recovery), we inspected the Utility’s filings with the CPUC and the filings with the CPUC byintervenors that may impact t
he Utility’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.•
For regulatory assets approved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes, we selected samples of costs and evaluated whether they met the definition of aregulatory asset by compa
ring the costs to the description of the costs approved by a CPUC decision and were recorded at the appropriate amount.•
We evaluated whether the Utility’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments,were appropriate and consis
tent with the information obtained in our procedures.208

Common Stock Ownership Restrictions – Deferred Tax Asset Valuation—Refer to Note 6 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter Descrip
tionUnder Section 382 of the Interna
l Revenue Code, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” net operating loss carryforwardsand other tax attribut
es may be subject to certain limitations (which could limit the Utility’s ability to use deferred tax assets to offset taxable income). In general,an ownership change occurs if th
e aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentageownership during the testing per
iod (generally three years). It is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change and theUtility’s net operating 
loss carryforwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.We identified the con
clusion and disclosure that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change as a critical audit matter due to the significantjudgments made by managem
ent to interpret Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. This required the application of a high degree of auditor judgment and theneed to involve our tax speci
alists when performing audit procedures to evaluate the Utility’s disclosure.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Address
ed in the AuditOur audit procedures rela
ted to the conclusion and disclosure that an ownership change did not occur included the following procedures, among others:•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of the analysis and conclusion related to the determination of whether a change in ownershipoccurred and the review of d
isclosure related to this matter.•
With the assistance of our tax specialists, we evaluated the analysis of whether a change in ownership occurred, including management’s process forinterpreting Section 382 of 
the Internal Revenue Code, the opinion from the external tax advisor, and determining the aggregate stock ownership changethat occurred in conjunc
tion with PG&E Corporation’s equity financing transactions.•
We tested the key facts in the opinion from the external tax advisor by comparing them to underlying source information and testing the mathematicalaccuracy of the calculations.

Description of the Common Stock
General
Our Articles of Incorporat
ion authorize the issuance of 3,600,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 400,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As ofDecember 31, 2020, there were app
roximately 1,984,678,673 shares of our Common Stock, no par value, outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding.All outstanding shares of our Common Stock 
are fully paid and nonassessable.We may issue our Common Stock from 
time to time upon such terms and for such consideration as may be determined by our Board of Directors. Suchfurther issuances, up to the 
aggregate amounts authorized by our Articles of Incorporation, will not require approval by our shareholders. We may also issueCommon Stock from time to ti
me under dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans.Voting Rights
Except as otherwise provided by l
aw, holders of our Common Stock have voting rights on the basis of one vote per share on each matter submitted to avote at a meeting of sha
reholders, subject to any class or series voting rights of holders of our preferred stock. Our shareholders may not cumulate votes inelections of directo
rs. As a result, the holders of our Common Stock and (if issued) preferred stock entitled to exercise more than 50% of the voting rights in anelection of directo
rs can elect all of the directors to be elected if they choose to do so. In such event, the holders of the remaining Common Stock and preferredstock voting for the elec
tion of directors will not be able to elect any persons to the Board of Directors.Dividend Rights
Holders of our Common Stock, subject to any p
rior rights or preferences of preferred stock outstanding, have equal rights to receive dividends if andwhen declared by our Board of Direc
tors out of funds legally available therefor.Liquidation Rights

In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up and after payment of all prior claims, holders of our Common Stock would be entitled to receiveany of our remaining assets, sub
ject to any preferential rights of holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock.Conversion, Redemption and Preemptive Rights
Holders of our Common Stock have no preemp
tive rights to subscribe for additional shares of Common Stock or any of our other securities, nor doholders of our Common Stock have any red
emption or conversion rights.Listing
Our Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange und
er the symbol “PCG.”Transfer Agent and Registrar
The transfer agent and r
egistrar for our Common Stock is EQ Shareowner Services.Limitations on Rights of Holders of Common Stock - Pref
erred StockThe rights of holders of Common Stock m
ay be materially limited or qualified by the rights of holders of preferred stock that we may issue in the future.Set forth below is a descript
ion of PG&E Corporation’s authority to issue preferred stock and the possible terms of that stock.Our Board of Directors is authori
zed, pursuant to our Articles of Incorporation, to issue up to 400,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more seriesand to fix and determine 
the number of shares of preferred stock of any series, to determine the designation of any such series, to increase or decrease the numberof shares of any such series subsequ
ent to the issue of shares of that series, and to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to orimposed upon any such series.
Prior to the issuance of shar
es of each series of our preferred stock, our Board of Directors is required to adopt resolutions and file a certificate ofdetermination with the Se
cretary of State of the State of California. The certificate of determination will fix for each series the designation and number of sharesand the rights, preferen
ces, privileges and restrictions of the shares including, but not limited to, the following:•
the title and stated value of the preferred stock;•
voting rights, if any, of the preferred stock;•
any rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions);•
the dividend rate(s), period(s) and/or payment date(s) or method(s) of calculation applicable to the preferred stock;•
whether dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative and, if cumulative, the date from which dividends on the preferred stock will accumulate;•
the relative ranking and preferences of the preferred stock as to dividend rights and rights upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs;•
the terms and conditions, if applicable, upon which the preferred stock will be convertible into our Common Stock, including the conversion price (ormanner of calculat
ion) and conversion period;•
the provision for redemption, if applicable, of the preferred stock;
•the provisions for a sinking fund, if any, for the preferred stock;•
liquidation preferences;•
any limitations on issuance of any class or series of preferred stock ranking senior to or on a parity with the class or series of preferred stock as todividend rights and rights upon liqu
idation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs; and•
any other specific terms, preferences, rights, limitations or restrictions of the preferred stock.All shares of preferred s
tock will, when issued, be fully paid and nonassessable and will not have any preemptive or similar rights.In addition to the terms 
listed above, we will set forth in a prospectus supplement the following terms relating to the class or series of preferred stockbeing offered:
•
the number of shares of preferred stock offered, the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of the preferred stock;•
the procedures for any auction and remarketing, if any, for the preferred stock;•
any listing of the preferred stock on any securities exchange; and•
a discussion of any material and/or special United States federal income tax considerations applicable to the preferred stock.Until our Board of Directors det
ermines the rights of the holders of a series of preferred stock, we cannot predict the effect of the issuance of any shares ofsuch series of preferr
ed stock upon the rights of holders of our Common Stock. However, the effect could include one or more of the following:•
restricting dividends on our Common Stock;•
diluting the voting power of our Common Stock;•
impairing the liquidation rights of our Common Stock; or•
delaying or preventing a change in control of us without further action by our shareholders.Our preferred stock, if issu
ed, would rank, with respect to dividends and upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up:•
senior to all classes or series of our Common Stock and to all of our equity securities ranking junior to the preferred stock;•
on a parity with all of our equity securities the terms of which specifically provide that the equity securities rank on a parity with the preferred stock; and•
junior to all of our equity securities the terms of which specifically provide that the equity securities rank senior to the preferred stock.Holding Company Structure
PG&E Corporation conducts its operat
ions primarily through its subsidiaries and substantially all of its consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries,including Pacific Gas and Ele
ctric Company (the “Utility”).
Accordingly, PG&E Corporation’s cash flow and its ability to meet its obligations are largely dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distribution orother payment of these e
arnings to PG&E Corporation in the form of dividends or loans or advances and repayment of loans and advances. PG&E Corporation’ssubsidiaries are separ
ate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts or make any funds available for payment pursuant to PG&ECorporation’s obligations.
Because PG&E Corporation is a holding comp
any, its obligations will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries,including all debt secur
ities and issued and outstanding preferred stock of the Utility (see Exhibit 4.46(b) for a description of such preferred stock). Furthermore,the rights of PG&E Corporation to par
ticipate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the liquidation or reorganization of the subsidiary will be subject to the priorclaims of such subsidiary’s 
creditors, including any holders of preferred stock of such subsidiary. To the extent that PG&E Corporation is itself a creditor withrecognized claims ag
ainst any of its subsidiaries, its claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interest in, or mortgages or other liens on, theassets of the subsidiary and would be subo
rdinated to any indebtedness or other liabilities of the subsidiary that are senior to the claims held by PG&E Corporation.Description of the Equity Units
In July and August 2020, we issued 16,000,000 Equity Units, each with 
a stated amount of $100. Each Equity Unit is comprised of (i) a prepaid forward stockpurchase contract (a 
“purchase contract”) of PG&E Corporation and (ii) a 1/48,000th undivided beneficial ownership interest in specified U.S. treasury strips thatmature on a quarterly b
asis from, and including, August 15, 2020 through, and including, August 15, 2023 and are held by the custodian as agent for the holders ofthe Equity Units (a “U.S. treasury st
rips component”). The following summary of the terms of the Equity Units, the summary of the terms of the purchase contractsset forth under the capt
ion “Description of the Purchase Contracts” and the summary of the terms of the U.S. treasury strips components set forth under the caption“Description of the U.S. Treasury Str
ips Components” below contain a description of all of the material terms of the Equity Units and their components but are notcomplete and are subject to
, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, the related contracts. We refer you to the purchase contract agreement and the custodialagreement, which are in
corporated by reference to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Components of the Equity Units
Each Equity Unit is comprised of:
•
a prepaid forward stock purch ase contract of PG&E Corporation entitling the holder to receive a number of shares of our Common Stock onAugust 16, 2023 (subject to postponement in 
certain limited circumstances, the “purchase contract settlement date”), or earlier if a “fundamentalchange” occurs prior to
 the settlement date or if the holder has elected “early settlement” (in each case, as defined herein and described below),determined by refer
ence to the settlement rate described below; and•
a U.S. treasury strips component. Unless previously settled at 
the holder’s option as described in “Description of the Purchase Contracts—Early Settlement” or “Description of the PurchaseContracts—Early Settlem
ent Upon a Fundamental Change,” we will deliver to the holder, on the purchase contract settlement date, in respect of each purchasecontract not more than 10.5263 sh
ares of our Common Stock and not less than 8.5929 shares of our Common Stock, based upon the applicable “settlement rate”(as defined below), which is subje
ct to adjustment as described herein, and the “applicable market value” (as defined below) of our Common Stock, as describedbelow under “Description of the Pur
chase Contracts—Delivery of Common Stock.”Each holder of Equity Units will be p
aid the amount received by the custodian from the U.S. government in respect of each U.S. treasury strip underlying theEquity Units owned by such holder on the business day 
immediately following the date such U.S. treasury strip matures on February 15, May 15, August 15 andNovember 15 of each

year, with such payments commencing on, and including, August 17, 2020, and ending on, and including, August 16, 2023, as described below under “Descriptionof the U.S. Treasury Strips Components.”
The stated amount of each Equ
ity Unit must be allocated between the U.S. treasury strips component and the purchase contract based upon their relative fairmarket values. We have d
etermined that the fair market value of each U.S. treasury strips component is $17.1402 and the fair market value of each purchasecontract is $82.8574. Each holder 
agrees to such allocation and this position is binding upon each holder (but not on the Internal Revenue Service).Separating and Recreating Equity Units
Upon the conditions and under the ci
rcumstances described below, a holder of 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof) has the right to separate itsEquity Units into its component pa
rts, and a holder of 48,000 separate purchase contracts (or any integral multiple thereof) and the underlying U.S. treasury stripshas the right to combine th
ese components to recreate 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof).Separating Equity Units
At initial issuance, the pu
rchase contracts and U.S. treasury strips components may be purchased and transferred only as Equity Units and will trade under theCUSIP number for the Equity Units.
On any business day during the period beginn
ing on, and including, the business day immediately following the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to, butexcluding, the second scheduled 
trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023, a holder of 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof) will havethe right to separate su
ch Equity Units and withdraw the U.S. treasury strips underlying those Equity Units. Because each Equity Unit evidences a 1/48,000thbeneficial ownership int
erest in specified U.S. treasury strips, any separation of Equity Units may be made only in integral multiples of 48,000 Equity Units. Towithdraw the U.S. treasury strips evid
enced by the Equity Units, the holder must:•
deliver the relevan t Equity Units to the purchase contract agent; and•
deliver a notice to th e purchase contract agent requesting that the purchase contract agent instruct the custodian to release to the holder the U.S.treasury strips underlying 
those Equity Units.The purchase contract ag
ent will then (i) cancel the Equity Units and deliver to the holder the purchase contracts underlying those Equity Units, which we refer toas “separate purchase 
contracts” and (ii) instruct the custodian to deliver to the holder the underlying U.S. treasury strips. If the holder has withdrawn the U.S.treasury strips previously und
erlying an Equity Unit, it may either continue to hold the separate purchase contract in global form through the purchase contractagent or receive a certificate for its
 separate purchase contract and hold it directly as the owner registered on the purchase contract register maintained on ourbehalf by the purchase cont
ract registrar. Any administrative fees and expenses related to withdrawing the U.S. treasury strips evidenced by the Equity Units thatare payable to the purch
ase contract agent or the custodian will be at the expense of the holder of Equity Units requesting withdrawal.“Business day”
 means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any day on which banking institutions in New York, New York are authorized or obligated byapplicable law or execu
tive order to close or be closed.There is no current or expe
cted trading market for the separate purchase contracts and we do not intend to apply to have the separate purchase contracts listed onany securities exchange o
r quoted on any automated quotation system. Accordingly, we do not expect there to be a liquid market in the separate purchase contractsat any time. Separate pu
rchase contracts and the withdrawn U.S. treasury strips will be transferable independently from each other.Recreating Equity Units

On any business day during the period beginning on, and including, the business day immediately following the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to, butexcluding, the second scheduled 
trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023, a holder of 48,000 separate purchase contracts (or any integral multiplethereof) will have the 
right to recreate Equity Units by delivering, for every 48,000 Equity Units being recreated, (i) to the purchase contract agent, 48,000 separatepurchase contracts, and (
ii) to the custodian, $66,000 face amount (or $33,000 face amount in the case of the U.S. treasury strips maturing on August 15, 2020) ofeach of the U.S. treasury strips 
that would be then remaining as a portion of the U.S. treasury strips component of an Equity Unit. Any recreation of Equity Unitsmay be made only in integr
al multiples of 48,000 Equity Units. R'The newly deposited U.S. treasury strips used to recreate the Equity Units must have the sameCUSIP numbers as the ones originally comp
rising the U.S. treasury strips component.Global Securities
Each Equity Unit and purchase cont
ract are represented by global securities registered in the name of a nominee of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).Holders are not entitled
 to receive definitive physical certificates for the Equity Units and purchase contracts, except under the limited circumstances describedunder “Book-Entry Procedures and Sett
lement.” Beneficial interests in an Equity Unit and, after separation, the separate purchase contract, will be representedthrough book-entry accounts of, and 
transfers will be effected through, direct or indirect participants in DTC.Deemed Actions by Holders by Acceptance
Each holder of Equity Units or sepa
rate purchase contracts, by acceptance of such securities, is deemed to have:•
irrevocably authorized and  directed the purchase contract agent to execute, deliver and perform on its behalf the purchase contract agreement,and appointed the purchase con
tract agent as its attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes;•
in the case of a purchase contract that is a component of an Equity Unit, or that is evidenced by a separate purchase contract, irrevocablyauthorized and direct
ed the purchase contract agent to execute, deliver and hold on its behalf the separate purchase contract or the componentpurchase contract evid
encing such purchase contract, and appointed the purchase contract agent as its attorney-in-fact for any and all suchpurposes;
•
consented to, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and provisions of the purchase contract agreement;•
in the case of a holder of an Equity Unit, agreed, for all purposes, including U.S. federal income tax purposes, to treat:•
an Equity Unit as an investment un it composed of two separate instruments, in accordance with its form;•
the allocation of the s tated amount per Equity Unit between the purchase contract and the U.S. treasury strips component so that suchholder’s initial tax b
asis in each purchase contract will be $82.8574 and such holder’s initial tax basis in each U.S. treasury stripscomponent will be $17.1402;
•
represented and warrant ed that neither the beneficial holder of the purchase contracts (including for these purposes a purchase contract that is acomponent of any Equity Unit) nor, to 
the knowledge of such beneficial holder, any other person, would become a “Substantial Shareholder” (asdefined in the Amended Artic
les) as a result of such beneficial holder’s acquisition of purchase contracts (treating the beneficial holder and anysuch other person as actual
ly holding, solely for purposes of this representation, the number of shares of our Common Stock that would bereceived upon settlement at t
he maximum settlement rate of all purchase contracts acquired or beneficially owned by such beneficial holder orany such other person, as applic
able, but treating all other purchase contracts as still unsettled), and, for the avoidance of doubt, taking intoaccount such beneficia
l holder’s and any such other person’s (i) current ownership of our Common Stock and any of the Utility’s preferred stockand (ii) other acquisi
tions of our Common Stock and any of the Utility’s preferred stock (if any) concurrent with or in connection with suchbeneficial holder’s 
acquisition of purchase contracts; and
•appointed the custodian to hold on its behalf and to receive payments related to the U.S. treasury strips components and agreed to indemnify thecustodian from and against 
any liability it may incur in connection with such appointment in the absence of gross negligence or willfulmisconduct on its part.
Listing of Securities
Our Equity Units are listed on the NYSE under th
e symbol “PCGU.” However, listing on the NYSE does not guarantee that a trading market will develop, and theunderwriters may discontinu
e market making at any time in their sole discretion without prior notice to Equity Unit holders. Accordingly, there can be noassurance that a liquid 
trading market will develop for the Equity Units (or, if developed, that a liquid trading market will be maintained), that the holder will beable to sell Equity Units at 
a particular time or that the prices the holder receives when the holder sells will be favorable.Title
The purchase contract ag
ent may treat the registered owner of any Equity Unit, which at initial issuance was a nominee of DTC, or, upon withdrawal of the U.S.treasury strips, the reg
istered owner of any separate purchase contract, as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of making payment and settling the purchasecontracts and for all o
ther purposes. Similarly, the custodian may treat the registered owner of any Equity Unit as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose ofmaking payments of the U.S. treasu
ry strips components and deliveries of the underlying U.S. treasury strips, if applicable, and for all other purposes.Accounting for the Equity Units
We record the issuance o
f the purchase contract portion of the Equity Units as Common Stock, net of issuance costs of the purchase contracts, in our financialstatements. All of the pro
ceeds from the issuance of the U.S. treasury strips components were paid to the custodian, and we did not receive any proceeds from suchissuance.
Based on U.S. GAAP, we do not expect the purchase contract 
component of the Equity Units to be revalued under fair value accounting principles.Our earnings per share cal
culations will reflect the shares issuable upon settlement of the purchase contracts portion of the Equity Units. Our basic earnings pershare will include the m
inimum shares issuable under the purchase contract for each period and our diluted earnings per share will include any incremental sharesthat would be issuable assuming a s
ettlement of the purchase contract at the end of each accounting period, if dilutive.Replacement of Equity Unit Certificates
In the event that physica
l certificates evidencing the Equity Units have been issued, any mutilated equity unit certificate will be replaced by us at the expense of theholder upon surrender of the c
ertificate to the purchase contract agent. Equity Unit certificates that have been destroyed, lost or stolen will be replaced by us at theexpense of the holder upon deliv
ery to us and the purchase contract agent of evidence of their destruction, loss or theft satisfactory to us and the purchase contractagent. In the case of a des
troyed, lost or stolen Equity Unit certificate, an indemnity satisfactory to us and the purchase contract agent may be required at theexpense of the holder of the Equ
ity Units before a replacement will be issued.Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will no
t be obligated to replace any Equity Unit certificates on or after the second scheduled trading day immediately precedingAugust 16, 2023 or any early settlem
ent date. In those circumstances, the purchase contract agreement will provide that, in lieu of the delivery of a replacementEquity Unit certifica
te, the purchase contract agent, upon delivery of the evidence and indemnity described above, will deliver or arrange for delivery of the sharesof Common Stock issuable pursuant to th
e purchase contracts included in the Equity Units evidenced by the Equity Unit certificate.
MiscellaneousThe purchase contract ag
reement provides that we will pay all fees and expenses related to the offering of the Equity Units and the enforcement by the purchasecontract agent of the 
rights of the holders of the Equity Units or the separate purchase contracts, other than expenses (including legal fees) of the underwriters.Should the holder elect to sep
arate or recreate Equity Units, the holder will be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection with that separation orrecreation, and we will
 have no liability therefor.Description of the Purchase Contracts
The purchase contracts a
re issued pursuant to the terms and provisions of the purchase contract agreement. The following summary contains a description of all ofthe material te
rms of the purchase contracts but is not complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the purchasecontract agreement, including
 the definitions in the purchase contract agreement of certain terms. We refer you to the purchase contract agreement which isincorporated by refer
ence to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Each purchase contract wi
ll initially form a part of an Equity Unit. On any business day during the period beginning on, and including, the business dayimmediately following 
the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to, but excluding, the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023,the holder will have the r
ight to separate 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof) and withdraw the U.S. treasury strips underlying those Equity Units.Following such separation, purchase 
contracts may be transferred separately from the U.S. treasury strips components.Delivery of Common Stock
Unless settled early at 
the holder’s option, for each purchase contract we will deliver to the holder on August 16, 2023 (subject to postponement in certain limitedcircumstances descr
ibed below, the “purchase contract settlement date”), a number of shares of our Common Stock. The number of shares of our Common Stockissuable upon settlement o
f each purchase contract (the “settlement rate”) will be determined by us as follows:•
if the applicable m arket value of our Common Stock is greater than the threshold appreciation price, then the holder will receive 8.5929 shares ofCommon Stock for
 each purchase contract (the “minimum settlement rate”);•
if the applicable m arket value of our Common Stock is greater than or equal to the reference price but less than or equal to the thresholdappreciation price, 
then the holder will receive a number of shares of Common Stock for each purchase contract equal to the Equity Unit statedamount of $100, 
divided by the applicable market value; and •
if the applicable m arket value of our Common Stock is less than the reference price, then the holder will receive 10.5263 shares of CommonStock for each purcha
se contract (the “maximum settlement rate”).The maximum settlem
ent rate and minimum settlement rate are each subject to adjustment as described under “—Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the FixedSettlement Rates” below
. Each of the minimum settlement rate and the maximum settlement rate is referred to as a “fixed settlement rate.”The reference pric
e is equal to $100 divided by  the maximum settle ment rate and is approximately equal to $9.5000.The threshold appreciat
ion price is equal to $100 divided by  the minimum settlement rate. T he threshold appreciation price, which is initially approximately$11.6375, represents an appreci
ation of approximately 22.50% over the reference price.For illustrative purposes only, 
the following table shows the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of a purchase contract at assumedapplicable market v
alues, based on a reference price of $9.5000 and a
threshold appreciation price of $11.6375. The table assumes that there will be no adjustments to the fixed settlement rates described below under “—Anti-DilutionAdjustments to the Fixed Settle
ment Rates” below or settled early at the option of holders as described under “—Early Settlement” or “—Early Settlement Upon aFundamental Change” below. There c
an be no assurance that the actual applicable market value will be within the assumed range set forth below.A holder of an Equity Unit or a separ
ate purchase contract, as applicable, would receive on the purchase contract settlement date the following numbers of sharesof Common Stock for each Equity Unit or s
eparate purchase contract at the following assumed applicable market values:Assumed Applicable Market Value
Number of Shares of Common Stock
$2.00
10.5263 $4.00
10.5263 $6.00
10.5263 $8.00
10.5263 $9.50
10.5263 $10.50
9.5238 $11.64
8.5929 $13.00
8.5929 $15.00
8.5929 $18.00
8.5929 $21.00
8.5929 $25.00
8.5929 $30.00
8.5929 $35.00
8.5929 As the above table illustr
ates, if, on the purchase contract settlement date, the applicable market value is greater than the threshold appreciation price, we would beobligated to deliver 8.5929 sha
res of Common Stock for each purchase contract.If, on the purchase contra
ct settlement date, the applicable market value is less than or equal to the threshold appreciation price but greater than or equal to thereference price o
f approximately $9.5000, we would be obligated to deliver a number of shares of our Common Stock on the purchase contract settlement dateequal to $100, 
divided by  the applicable mark et value. As a result, we would retain all appreciation in the market value of our Common Stock underlying eachpurchase contract between
 the reference price and the threshold appreciation price.If, on the purchase contra
ct settlement date, the applicable market value is less than the reference price of approximately $9.5000, we would be obligated to deliverupon settlement of the pur
chase contract 10.5263 shares of Common Stock for each purchase contract, regardless of the market price of our Common Stock. As aresult, the holder would suffe
r the full decline in market value of the Common Stock below the reference price.Because the applicable 
market value of the Common Stock is determined over the “valuation period” (as defined below), the number of shares of Common Stockdelivered for each pur
chase contract may be greater than or less than the number that would have been delivered based on the closing price (or daily VWAP) of theCommon Stock on the last trading day o
f such valuation period. In addition, the holder will bear the risk of fluctuations in the market price of the shares ofCommon Stock deliverable upon set
tlement of the purchase contracts between the end of such valuation period and the date such shares are delivered.The term “applicabl
e market value” means the arithmetic average of the daily VWAPs of our Common Stock on each trading day of the valuation period.
The term “valuation period” means each of the 20 consecutive trading days beginning on, and including, the 21st scheduled trading day immediately precedingAugust 16, 2023.
The “daily VWAP” of our Common Stock on any trad
ing day means the per share volume-weighted average price as displayed under the heading “BloombergVWAP” on Bloomberg page “PCG <equity> AQR” (or its equiva
lent successor if such page is not available) in respect of the period from the scheduled open oftrading until the schedul
ed close of trading of the primary trading session on such trading day (or if such volume-weighted average price is unavailable, the marketvalue of one share of our Common Stock on su
ch trading day determined, using a volume-weighted average method, by a nationally recognized independentinvestment banking firm 
retained for this purpose by us). The “daily VWAP” will be determined without regard to after-hours trading or any other trading outsideof the regular trading s
ession trading hours. The “average VWAP” per share over a certain period means the arithmetic average of the daily VWAP per share foreach trading day in such per
iod.“Trading day” means a day on which 
(i) there is no “market disruption event” (as defined below) and (ii) trading in our Common Stock (or other security for whicha daily VWAP must be determined
) generally occurs on the NYSE or, if our Common Stock (or such other security) is not then listed on the NYSE, on theprincipal other U.S. national o
r regional securities exchange on which our Common Stock (or such other security) is then listed or, if our Common Stock (or suchother security) is not th
en listed on a U.S. national or regional securities exchange, on the principal other market on which our Common Stock (or such othersecurity) is then trad
ed. If our Common Stock (or such other security) is not so listed or traded, “trading day” means a “business day.”“Scheduled trading day” me
ans a day that is scheduled to be a trading day on the NYSE or, if our Common Stock is not then listed on the NYSE, on the principalother U.S. national or regional s
ecurities exchange on which our Common Stock is then listed or, if our Common Stock is not then listed on a U.S. national orregional securities 
exchange, on the principal other market on which our Common Stock is then traded. If our Common Stock is not so listed or admitted fortrading, “scheduled trad
ing day” means a “business day.”“Market disruption event
” means (i) a failure by the primary U.S. national or regional securities exchange or market on which our Common Stock is listed oradmitted for trading 
to open for trading during its regular trading session or (ii) the occurrence or existence prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on anyscheduled trading day for our Com
mon Stock for more than one half-hour period in the aggregate during regular trading hours of any suspension or limitationimposed on trading (by reason of 
movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the relevant stock exchange, relevant market or otherwise) in our CommonStock or in any options contracts o
r futures contracts relating to our Common Stock.On the purchase contract se
ttlement date, our Common Stock will be issued and delivered to the holder or the holder’s designee, upon (i) surrender of certificatesrepresenting the purchas
e contracts, if such purchase contracts are held in certificated form, and (ii) payment by the holder of any transfer or similar taxes payablein connection with the issuanc
e of our Common Stock to any person other than the holder. As long as the purchase contracts are evidenced by one or more globalpurchase contract ce
rtificates deposited with DTC, procedures for settlement will be governed by DTC’s applicable procedures.If one or more of the 20 conse
cutive scheduled trading days in the valuation period is not a trading day, the purchase contract settlement date will be postponeduntil the second business day im
mediately following the last trading day of the valuation period.Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the l
ast trading day of the valuation period, the shares of Common Stock underlying each purchase contract will not beoutstanding, and the holder of such pu
rchase contract will not have any voting rights, rights to dividends or other distributions or other rights of a holder of ourCommon Stock by virtue of holding such purch
ase contract. The person in whose name any shares of our Common Stock shall be issuable upon settlement of thepurchase contract on the pu
rchase contract settlement date will be treated as the holder of record of such shares as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the lasttrading day of the 20 consecut
ive trading day period during which the applicable market value is determined.
We will pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of any shares of our Common Stock upon settlement of the purchasecontracts, unless the tax 
is due because the holder requests any shares to be issued in a name other than the holder’s name, in which case the holder will pay thattax.
Early Settlement
Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the se
cond scheduled trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023, any holder of 48,000 Equity Units (or anyintegral multiple thereof) or a 
holder of one or more separate purchase contracts, may elect to settle such Equity Units or separate purchase contracts early andreceive a number of shares
 of Common Stock per purchase contract equal to the “early settlement rate.” The early settlement rate is equal to the minimumsettlement rate on 
the early settlement date, subject to adjustment as described below under “—Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates,” unlessthe holder elects to se
ttle the holder’s purchase contracts early in connection with a fundamental change, in which case the holder will receive upon settlement ofthe holder’s purchase cont
racts a number of shares of our Common Stock based on the “fundamental change early settlement rate” as described under “—EarlySettlement Upon a Fundamental Chang
e.” We refer to this right as the “early settlement right.”The holder’s right to rec
eive Common Stock upon early settlement of a purchase contract is subject to (i) delivery of a written and signed notice of election (an“early settlement notice”) to the 
purchase contract agent electing early settlement of such purchase contract, (ii) if such purchase contract or the Equity Unit thatincludes such purcha
se contract is held in certificated form, surrendering the certificates representing the purchase contract and (iii) payment by the holder of anytransfer or simila
r taxes payable in connection with the issuance of our Common Stock to any person other than the holder. As long as the purchase contracts or theEquity Units are evidenced by one o
r more global certificates deposited with DTC, procedures for early settlement will be governed by DTC’s applicableprocedures.
Upon surrender of the Equity Unit or th
e separate purchase contract, as applicable, and payment of any applicable transfer or similar taxes due because of any issueof such shares in a name of a p
erson other than the holder, the holder will receive the applicable number of shares of Common Stock (and any cash payable forfractional shares) du
e upon early settlement on the second business day following the “early settlement date” (as defined below).If the holder complies wi
th the requirements for effecting the early settlement right prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any business day, then that day willbe considered the “ear
ly settlement date.” If the holder complies with such requirements at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any business day or at anytime on a day that is not a bus
iness day, then the next succeeding business day will be considered the “early settlement date.” Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York Citytime, on the early set
tlement date, the shares of Common Stock underlying each purchase contract will not be outstanding, and the holder of such purchase contractwill not have any voting rights, r
ights to dividends or other distributions or other rights of a holder of our Common Stock by virtue of holding such purchasecontract. The person in whose nam
e any shares of our Common Stock shall be issuable upon such early settlement of the purchase contract will be treated as theholder of record of such shar
es as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant early settlement date.Because each Equity Unit eviden
ces a 1/48,000th beneficial ownership interest in specified U.S. treasury strips, any early settlement of Equity Units may be madeonly in integral multip
les of 48,000 Equity Units.Upon early settlement a
t the holder’s election of purchase contracts held as components of Equity Units, the custodian will deliver the U.S. treasury stripsevidenced by those Equity Units to such ho
lder free and clear of any liens or other encumbrances on the second business day following the early settlement date.Early Settlement Upon a Fundamental Change
If a “fundamental ch
ange” occurs and the holder elects to settle the holder’s purchase contracts early in connection with such fundamental change in accordancewith the procedures describ
ed under “—Early Settlement” above, the holder will receive per purchase contract a number of shares of our Common Stock or cash,securities or other

property, as applicable, equal to the “fundamental change early settlement rate,” as described below. An early settlement will be deemed for these purposes to be“in connection with” such funda
mental change if the holder delivers the holder’s early settlement notice to the purchase contract agent, and otherwise satisfies therequirements for ef
fecting early settlement of the holder’s purchase contracts, during the period beginning on, and including, the effective date of the fundamentalchange and ending at 5:00 p.m., New York City ti
me, on the 35th business day thereafter (or, if earlier, the second scheduled trading day immediately precedingAugust 16, 2023) (the “fundamental 
change early settlement period”). We refer to this right as the “fundamental change early settlement right.”If the holder complies wi
th the requirements for effecting the fundamental change early settlement right prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any businessday during the fun
damental change early settlement period, then that day will be considered the “fundamental change early settlement date.” If the holder complieswith such requirements at o
r after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any business day during the fundamental change early settlement period or at any time on aday during the fundamental 
change early settlement period that is not a business day, then the next succeeding business day will be considered the “fundamentalchange early settlement date.”
Any early settlement of Equ
ity Units in connection with a fundamental change may be made only in integral multiples of 48,000 Equity Units.We will provide the purchas
e contract agent, custodian and the holders of Equity Units and separate purchase contracts with a notice of a fundamental changewithin five business days afte
r its effective date and issue a press release announcing such effective date. The notice will also set forth, among other things, (i) theapplicable fundament
al change early settlement rate, (ii) if not Common Stock, the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property receivable by the holderupon settlement and (ii
i) the deadline by which each holder’s fundamental change early settlement right must be exercised.A “fundamental change” wil
l be deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of any of the following:•
any “person” or “group” within th e meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), other than us, anyof our wholly owned subsidiaries and any of ou
r and their employee benefit plans, files a Schedule TO or any other schedule, form or reportunder the Exchange Act disclosing 
that such person or group has become the direct or indirect “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3under the Exchange Act) of mor
e than 50% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock;•
the consummation of (A) any r ecapitalization, reclassification or change of our Common Stock (other than changes resulting from a subdivisionor combination) as a resu
lt of which our Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities, other property orassets; (B) any share exchang
e, consolidation or merger of us pursuant to which our Common Stock will be converted into cash, securities orother property or assets; o
r (C) any sale, lease or other transfer in one transaction or a series of transactions of all or substantially all of theconsolidated assets of us and our subs
idiaries, taken as a whole, to any person other than one of our wholly owned subsidiaries; or•
our Common Stock (or other Common Stock re ceivable upon settlement of the holder’s purchase contracts, if applicable) ceases to be listed orquoted on any of the NYSE, the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the NASDAQ Global Market 
(or any of their respective successors).A transaction or transac
tions described in either of the first two bullets above will not constitute a fundamental change, however, if (i) at least 90% of theconsideration receiv
ed or to be received by stockholders of our Common Stock (excluding cash payments for fractional shares) in connection with such transactionor transactions consists of sh
ares of Common Stock that are listed on any of the NYSE, the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the NASDAQ Global Market (orany of their respectiv
e successors), or will be so listed when issued or exchanged in connection with such transaction or transactions and (ii) as a result of suchtransaction or transactions
 such consideration becomes the consideration receivable upon settlement of the holder’s purchase contracts, if applicable, excludingcash payments for frac
tional shares.If any transaction in which ou
r Common Stock is replaced by the securities of another entity occurs, following completion of any related fundamental change earlysettlement period (o
r, in the case of a transaction that would
have been a fundamental change but for the immediately preceding paragraph, following the effective date of such transaction), references to us in the definition of“fundamental change” above
 shall instead be references to such other entity.The “fundamental change 
early settlement rate” will be determined by us by reference to the table below, based on the date on which the fundamental changeoccurs or becomes effective (t
he “fundamental change effective date”) and the “stock price” in the fundamental change, which will be:•
in the case of a fundamen tal change described in the second bullet of the definition of “fundamental change” in which all holders of shares of ourCommon Stock receive only cash in 
the fundamental change, the stock price will be the cash amount paid per share of our Common Stock; and•
in all other cases, the s tock price will be the arithmetic average of the daily VWAPs of our Common Stock over the five consecutive trading dayperiod ending on the trading day 
immediately preceding such fundamental change effective date.The stock prices set forth 
in the column headings of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the fixed settlement rates are adjusted. The adjustedstock prices will equal th
e stock prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the maximumsettlement rate immediately prior to t
he adjustment giving rise to the stock price adjustment and the denominator of which is the maximum settlement rate as soadjusted. The fundame
ntal change early settlement rates per purchase contract in the table below will be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as thefixed settlement r
ates as set forth under “—Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates.”The following table 
sets forth the fundamental change early settlement rate per purchase contract for each stock price and fundamental change effective date setforth below:

if the applicable sto ck price is between two stock prices in the table or the applicable fundamental change effective date is between twofundamental change effective date
s in the table, the fundamental change early settlement rate will be determined by straight line interpolationbetween the fundamental c
hange early settlement rates set forth for the higher and lower stock prices and the earlier and later fundamentalchange effective da
tes, as applicable, based on a 365- or 366-day year, as applicable;•
if the applicable sto ck price is greater than $35.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the same time as the stock pricesset forth in the column he
adings of the table above), then the fundamental change early settlement rate will be the minimum settlement rate; or•
if the applicable sto ck price is less than $2.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the same time as the stock prices setforth in the column headings o
f the table above, the “minimum stock price”), the fundamental change early settlement rate will be determined asif the stock price equa
led the minimum stock price, and using straight line interpolation, as described in the first bullet of this paragraph, if thefundamental change effective date
 is between two fundamental change effective dates in the table.The maximum number of shar
es of our Common Stock deliverable under a purchase contract is 10.5263, subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the sametime as the fixed set
tlement rates as set forth under “—Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates.”Our obligation to 
settle the purchase contracts at the fundamental change early settlement rate could be considered a penalty, in which case the enforceabilitythereof would be subject to gen
eral principles of reasonableness of economic remedies.We will deliver the sha
res of our Common Stock, securities, cash or other property payable as a result of the holder’s exercise of the fundamental change earlysettlement right on th
e second business day following the fundamental change early settlement date. Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fundamentalchange early

settlement date, the shares of Common Stock underlying each purchase contract will not be outstanding, and the holder of such purchase contract will not have anyvoting rights, rights to dividends o
r other distributions or other rights of a holder of our Common Stock by virtue of holding such purchase contract. The person inwhose name any shares of our Common Stock or o
ther securities, if applicable, shall be issuable following exercise of a holder’s fundamental change earlysettlement right wil
l be treated as the holder of record of such shares or other securities, if applicable, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fundamentalchange early settlement date.
Upon early settlement of pu
rchase contracts held as components of Equity Units at the holder’s election upon a fundamental change, the custodian will deliver theU.S. treasury strips evidenced by thos
e Equity Units to such holder free and clear of any liens or other encumbrances on the second business day following thefundamental change ea
rly settlement date.If the holder does not ele
ct to exercise the holder’s fundamental change early settlement right, the holder’s purchase contracts will remain outstanding and will besubject to normal sett
lement on any subsequent early settlement date or any subsequent fundamental change early settlement date, as the case may be.Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rat
esEach fixed settlemen
t rate will be adjusted as described below, except that we will not make any adjustments to the fixed settlement rates if holders of the purchasecontracts particip
ate (other than in the case of a share split or share combination or a tender or exchange offer described in clause (5) below), at the same time andupon the same terms as holde
rs of our Common Stock and solely as a result of holding the purchase contracts, in any of the transactions described below withouthaving to settle their pu
rchase contracts as if they held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the maximum settlement rate as of the record date for suchtransaction, 
multiplied by  (ii) the number of purch ase contracts held by such holder.(1)
If we exclusively issue shar es of our Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of our Common Stock, or if we effect a share split orshare combination, each 
fixed settlement rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:CR1 = CR0 x
OS1 OS0
where,
CR0
= such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date (as defined below) of such dividend ordistribution, or immedi
ately prior to the open of business on the effective date of such share split or share combination, as applicable;CR1
= such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately after the close of business on such record date or immediately after the open of business onsuch effective date, 
as applicable;OS0
= the number of shares of our Common Sto ck outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on such record date or immediatelyprior to the open of business on such e
ffective date, as applicable, before giving effect to such dividend, distribution, share split or sharecombination; and
OS1
= the number of shares of our Common Sto ck outstanding immediately after giving effect to such dividend, distribution, share split or sharecombination.
Any adjustment made under this 
clause (1) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution, orimmediately aft
er the open of business on the effective date for such share split or share combination, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution of the typedescribed in this clause 
(1) is declared but not so paid or made, each fixed settlement rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date our board ofdirectors or a commi
ttee thereof determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such dividend ordistribution had not been dec
lared. For the purposes of this clause (1), the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the close ofbusiness on the relevant re
cord date or immediately prior to the open of business on the relevant effective date, as the case
may be, and the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such dividend, distribution, share split or share combinationshall, in each case, not in
clude shares that we hold in treasury. We will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of our Common Stock that we holdin treasury.
“Effective date” 
as used in this clause (1) means the first date on which the shares of our Common Stock trade on the relevant stock exchange, regular way,reflecting the relevant share s
plit or share combination, as applicable.“Record date” means, with r
espect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of our Common Stock (or other applicablesecurity) have the righ
t to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which our Common Stock (or such other security) is exchanged for or converted intoany combination of cash, secu
rities or other property, the date fixed for determination of holders of our Common Stock (or such other security) entitled to receivesuch cash, securities or oth
er property (whether such date is fixed by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, statute, contract or otherwise).(2)
If we issue to all or substant ially all holders of our Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling them, for a period of not more than 45calendar days after 
the announcement date of such issuance, to subscribe for or purchase shares of our Common Stock at a price per share that isless than the average VWAP per sha
re of our Common Stock for the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading dayimmediately prec
eding the date of announcement of such issuance, each fixed settlement rate will be increased based on the following formula:CR1 = CR0 x
OS0 + X OS0 + Y
where,
CR0
= such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such issuance;CR1
= such fixed settlement rate in  effect immediately after the close of business on such record date;OS0
= the number of shares of our Common Sto ck outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on such record date;X
= the total number of shar es of our Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants; andY
= the number of shares of our Common Sto ck equal to (i) the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants, divided by (ii) the average VWAP per sha
re of our Common Stock over the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the tradingday immediately pre
ceding the date of announcement of the issuance of such rights, options or warrants.Any increase made under this 
clause (2) will be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effectiveimmediately aft
er the close of business on the record date for such issuance. To the extent that such rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to theirexpiration or shares of Common Sto
ck are not delivered after the exercise of such rights, options or warrants, each fixed settlement rate shall be decreased to suchfixed settlement r
ate that would then be in effect had the increase with respect to the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of deliveryof only the number of shares of Com
mon Stock actually delivered, if any. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, each fixed settlement rate shall beimmediately read
justed, effective as of the date our board of directors or a committee thereof determines not to issue such rights, options or warrants to such fixedsettlement rate 
that would then be in effect if such record date for such issuance had not occurred.For the purpose of this clause (2
), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders of our Common Stock to subscribe for or purchaseshares of our Common Stock at less th
an such average VWAP per share for the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading dayimmediately prec
eding the date of announcement of such issuance, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of our Common Stock, thereshall be taken into accoun
t any consideration received by us for such rights, options or warrants and any
amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by our board of directors in good faith.(3)
If we distribute shares of ou r capital stock, evidences of our indebtedness, other assets or property of ours or rights, options or warrants toacquire our capital s
tock or other securities, to all or substantially all holders of our Common Stock, excluding:•
dividends, distributions or issuan ces as to which the provisions set forth in clause (1) or (2) shall apply;•
dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which the provisions set forth in clause (4) below shall apply;•
any distributions upon conversion of, o r in exchange for, our Common Stock in connection with a recapitalization, reclassification, change,consolidation, merger or o
ther combination, share exchange, or sale, lease or other transfer or disposition resulting in the change in theconsideration due upon settl
ement of the purchase contracts as described below under “—Recapitalizations, Reclassifications and Changesof Our Common Stock”;
•
except as otherwise descr ibed below, rights issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan adopted by us; and•
spin-offs as to which the provisions s et forth below in this clause (3) shall apply;then each fixed settlement rate 
will be increased based on the following formula:CR1 = CR0 x
SP0 SP0 - FMV
where,
CR0
= such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such distribution;CR1
= such fixed settlement rate in  effect immediately after the close of business on such record date;SP0
= the average VWAP per share of our Com mon Stock over the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading dayimmediately preceding the ex-date
 (as defined below) for such distribution; andFMV
= the fair market va lue (as determined by our board of directors in good faith) of the shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness,assets, property, rights, options o
r warrants so distributed, expressed as an amount per share of our Common Stock on the ex-date for suchdistribution.
“Ex-date” means the f
irst date on which the shares of our Common Stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without theright to receive the 
issuance, dividend or distribution in question, from us or, if applicable, from the seller of our Common Stock on such exchange or market (inthe form of due bills or oth
erwise) as determined by such exchange or market.Any increase made under the po
rtion of this clause (3) above will become effective immediately after the close of business on the record date for such distribution.If such distribution is not so pa
id or made, each fixed settlement rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date our board of directors or a committeethereof determines no
t to pay such dividend or distribution, to be such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.Notwithstanding the foregoing, if 
“FMV” (as defined above) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each holdershall receive, in resp
ect of each purchase contract, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of our Common Stock, without having to settle suchpurchase contract, the 
amount and kind of our capital stock, evidences of our indebtedness, other assets or property of ours or rights, options or warrants to acquireour capital stock or othe
r securities that such holder would have received if such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the maximumsettlement rate 
in effect on the record date for the distribution.If we issue rights, options or warr
ants that are only exercisable upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, then:
•we will not adjust the fixed se ttlement rates pursuant to the foregoing in this clause (3) until the earliest of these triggering events occurs; and•
we will readjust the fixed s ettlement rates to the extent any of these rights, options or warrants are not exercised before they expire; provided that the rights, options or warrants 
trade together with our Common Stock and will be issued in respect of future issuances of the shares of ourCommon Stock.
With respect to an adjus
tment pursuant to this clause (3) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on our Common Stock of shares ofcapital stock of any cl
ass or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit, that are, or, when issued, will be, listed or admittedfor trading on a U.S. national secu
rities exchange, which we refer to as a “spin-off,” each fixed settlement rate will be increased based on the following formula:CR1 = CR0 x
FMV0 + MP0 MP0
where,
CR0
= such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the ex-date for the spin-off;CR1
= such fixed settlement rate in  effect immediately after the open of business on the ex-date for the spin-off;FMV0
= the average VWAP per share of th e capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of our Common Stock applicable to oneshare of our Common Stock over the t
en consecutive trading day period commencing on, and including, the ex-date for the spin-off, orthe “valuation period”; and
MP0
= the average VWAP per share of our Com mon Stock over the valuation period.The increase to each f
ixed settlement rate under the preceding paragraph will be calculated as of the close of business on the last trading day of the valuation periodbut will be given retroac
tive effect as of immediately after the open of business on the ex-date of the spin-off. Because we will make the adjustment to each fixedsettlement rate with retroactive effect,
 we will delay the settlement of any purchase contract where any date for determining the number of shares of our CommonStock issuable to a holder occu
rs during the valuation period until the second business day after the last trading day of such valuation period. If such dividend ordistribution is not 
so paid, each fixed settlement rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date our board of directors or a committee thereof determines not tomake or pay such dividend or dist
ribution, to be such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.(4)
If any cash dividend or distr ibution is made to all or substantially all holders of our Common Stock, each fixed settlement rate will be adjustedbased on the following formula:
CR1 = CR0 x
SP0 SP0 - C
where,

CR0= such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution;CR1
= such fixed settlement rate in  effect immediately after the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution;SP0
= the average VWAP per share of our Com mon Stock over the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the Trading Dayimmediately prec
eding the ex-date for such distribution; andC
= the amount in cash per shar e we distribute to all or substantially all holders of our Common Stock.Any increase made under this 
clause (4) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution. If suchdividend or distributi
on is not so paid, each fixed settlement rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date our board of directors or a committee thereofdetermines not to make o
r pay such dividend or distribution, to be such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had notbeen declared.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if 
“C” (as defined above) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each holder shallreceive, in respect o
f each purchase contract, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of our Common Stock, without having to settle suchpurchase contract, the 
amount of cash that such holder would have received if such holder owned a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to the maximumsettlement rate on 
the record date for such cash dividend or distribution.(5)
If we or any of our subsidiaries make a payment in respect of a tender or exchange offer for our Common Stock, to the extent that the cash andvalue of any other consider
ation included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the average VWAP per share of our CommonStock over the ten consecutiv
e trading day period commencing on, and including, the trading day next succeeding the last date on which tendersor exchanges may be made pursu
ant to such tender or exchange offer, or the “expiration date”, each fixed settlement rate will be increased basedon the following formula:
CR1 = CR0 x
AC + (SP1x OS1) OS0 x SP1
where,
CR0
= such fixed settlement rate in  effect immediately prior to the close of business on the expiration date;CR1
= such fixed settlement rate in  effect immediately after the close of business on the expiration date;AC
= the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by our board of directors in good faith) paid or payable forshares purchased in such tende
r or exchange offer;OS0
= the number of shares of our Common Sto ck outstanding immediately prior to the expiration date (prior to giving effect to the purchase ofall shares accepted 
for purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer);OS1
= the number of shares of our Common Sto ck outstanding immediately after the expiration date (after giving effect to the purchase of allshares accepted for pur
chase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer); andSP1
= the average VWAP of our Common Stock over th e ten consecutive trading day period commencing on, and including, the trading day nextsucceeding the expiration
 date (the “averaging period”).The increase to each f
ixed settlement rate under the preceding paragraph will be calculated at the close of business on the last trading day of the averaging periodbut will be given retr
oactive effect as of immediately after the close of business on the expiration date. Because we will make the adjustment to each fixedsettlement rate wi
th retroactive effect, we will delay the settlement of any purchase contracts where any date for determining the number of shares of our CommonStock issuable to a holder occu
rs during the averaging period until the second business day after the
last trading day of such averaging period. For the avoidance of doubt, no adjustment under this clause (5) will be made if such adjustment would result in adecrease in any fixed se
ttlement rate.In the event that we or one of ou
r subsidiaries is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but we or suchsubsidiary is permanently p
revented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then each fixed settlement rate shallagain be adjusted to be such f
ixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made (or had been made only inrespect of the purchases 
that have been made and not rescinded).We may, to the extent pe
rmitted by law and the rules of NYSE or any other securities exchange on which our Common Stock or the purchase contracts is thenlisted, increase ea
ch fixed settlement rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 business days if such increase is irrevocable during such 20 business days andour board of directors (or 
a committee thereof) determines that such increase would be in our best interest. In addition, we may make such increases in each fixedsettlement rate 
as we deem advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of our Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution ofshares of our Common Stock (or issuanc
e of rights or warrants to acquire shares of our Common Stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposesor for any other reason. We 
may only make such a discretionary adjustment if we make the same proportionate adjustment to each fixed settlement rate.Beneficial owners of the pur
chase contracts may, in certain circumstances, including upon a distribution of cash dividends to holders of our shares of CommonStock, be deemed to have rec
eived a distribution subject to U.S. federal income tax as a dividend as a result of an adjustment or the nonoccurrence of anadjustment to the fixed s
ettlement rates. See “Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences.”If we have a rights plan in e
ffect upon settlement of the purchase contracts into Common Stock, the holder will receive, in addition to any shares of Common Stockreceived in connection wi
th such settlement, the rights under the rights plan. However, if, prior to any settlement, the rights have separated from the shares ofCommon Stock in accordance with th
e provisions of the applicable rights plan, each fixed settlement rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if wedistributed to all or subst
antially all holders of our Common Stock, shares of our capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, property, rights, options orwarrants as described in c
lause (3) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. We do not currently havea stockholder rights plan in 
effect.Adjustments to the fixed set
tlement rates will be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of our Common Stock, and corresponding adjustments to thereference price 
and the threshold appreciation period will be calculated to the nearest $0.0001.The fixed settlement 
rate will not be adjusted:•
upon the issuance of any shares of ou r Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends orinterest payable on our se
curities and the investment of additional optional amounts in Common Stock under any plan;•
upon the issuance of any shares of ou r Common Stock or options, rights or warrants to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or futurebenefit or other incen
tive plan or program of or assumed by us or any of our subsidiaries;•
subject to the second imm ediately preceding paragraph, upon the issuance of any shares of our Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant,right or exercisable, 
exchangeable or convertible security not described in the preceding bullet and outstanding as of the date the purchasecontracts were first 
issued;•
for a change in the par va lue of our Common Stock;•
for stock repurchases tha t are not tender or exchange offers referred to in clause (5) of the adjustments above, including structured or derivativetransactions or pursuant to 
a stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors that is not a tender or exchange offer referred to inclause (5).
Except as otherwise provided abov
e, we will be responsible for making all calculations called for under the purchase contracts. These calculations include, but arenot limited to, deter
minations of the fundamental change early settlement rate, the stock price in connection with a fundamental change, the daily VWAP, theaverage VWAPs and the fixed sett
lement rates of the purchase contracts.
We will be required, within ten business days after the fixed settlement rates are adjusted, to provide or cause to be provided written notice of the adjustment to theholders of the purcha
se contracts. We will also deliver to the purchase contract agent a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which theadjustment to each fixed 
settlement rate was determined and setting forth each adjusted fixed settlement rate.For the avoidance of doubt, if an 
adjustment is made to the fixed settlement rates, no separate inversely proportionate adjustment will be made to the referenceprice or the threshold app
reciation price because the reference price is equal to $100 divided by  the maximum settle ment rate (as adjusted in the manner describedherein) and the threshold 
appreciation price is equal to $100 divided by  the minimum settlement rate (as a djusted in the manner described herein).Whenever the terms of 
the purchase contracts require us to calculate the daily VWAP per share of our Common Stock over a span of multiple days, our board ofdirectors will make appro
priate adjustments in good faith (including, without limitation, to the applicable market value, the early settlement rate or the fundamentalchange early settlement rate (as t
he case may be)) to account for any adjustments to the fixed settlement rates (as the case may be) that become effective, or anyevent that would require such 
an adjustment if the record date, ex-date, effective date or expiration date (as the case may be) of such event occurs, during therelevant period used to
 calculate such prices or values (as the case may be).If:
•
the record date for a d ividend or distribution on shares of our Common Stock occurs after the end of the 20 consecutive trading day period usedfor calculating the applicable mar
ket value and before the purchase contract settlement date; and•
that dividend or distribut ion would have resulted in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable to the holders of the purchase contracts hadsuch record date occurr
ed on or before the last trading day of such 20-trading day period,then we will deem the holders o
f the purchase contracts to be holders of record of our Common Stock for purposes of that dividend or distribution. In this case, theholders of the purchase cont
racts would receive the dividend or distribution on our Common Stock together with the number of shares of our Common Stockissuable upon settlement o
f the purchase contracts.Recapitalizations, Reclassifica
tions and Changes of Our Common StockIn the event of:
•
any consolidation or merge r of us with or into another person;•
any sale, transfer, le ase or conveyance to another person of all or substantially all of our property and assets;•
any reclassificat ion of our Common Stock into securities (other than a share split or share combination), including securities other than ourCommon Stock; or
•
any statutory exchange of our s ecurities with another person (other than in connection with a consolidation or merger),in each case, as a resul
t of which our Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cashor any combination thereo
f) (each, a “reorganization event”), each purchase contract outstanding immediately prior to such reorganization event shall, without theconsent of the holders of the pu
rchase contracts, become a contract to purchase the kind of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or anycombination thereof) 
that a holder of our Common Stock would have been entitled to receive in connection with such reorganization event (such stock, othersecurities or other prop
erty or assets (including cash or any combination thereof), the “exchange property”, with each “unit of exchange property” meaning thekind and amount of exchange prope
rty that a holder of one share of our Common Stock would have received in such reorganization event) and, prior to or at theeffective time o
f such reorganization event, we or the successor or purchasing person, as the case may be, shall execute with the purchase contract agent asupplemental agreem
ent pursuant to the purchase contract agreement and the purchase contracts to provide for such change in the right to settle the purchasecontracts.

If the transaction causes our Common Stock to be converted into, or exchanged for, the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined basedin part upon any form of stockhold
er election), the exchange property underlying the purchase contracts will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types andamounts of consideration a
ctually received by the holders of our Common Stock in such reorganization event.The number of units of exchange p
roperty we will deliver upon the settlement of each purchase contract following the effective date of such reorganization eventwill be determined as if refere
nces to our Common Stock deliverable upon settlement of the purchase contracts on the purchase contract settlement date, earlysettlement date or 
fundamental change early settlement date, as the case may be, were to units of exchange property (without interest thereon and without any rightto dividends or distributions th
ereon which have a record date prior to the date on which holders of the purchase contracts become holders of record of theunderlying shares of our Common Stock). For 
the purpose of determining which bullet of the definition of settlement rate in the second paragraph under “—Delivery of Common Stock” will apply upon s
ettlement of each purchase contract, and for the purpose of calculating the settlement rate if the second bullet isapplicable, the value o
f a unit of exchange property will be determined in good faith by our board of directors (which determination will be final), except that if aunit of exchange property in
cludes Common Stock or American Depositary Receipts, or “ADRs”, that are traded on a U.S. national securities exchange, the valueof such Common Stock or ADRs will be the average ov
er the 20 consecutive trading day period used for calculating the applicable market value of the volume-weighted average prices 
for such Common Stock or ADRs, as displayed on the applicable Bloomberg screen (as determined in good faith by our board of directors(which determination wil
l be final)); or, if such price is not available, the average market value per share of such Common Stock or ADRs over such period asdetermined, using a volume
-weighted average method, by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by us for this purpose. Theprovisions of this paragraph wil
l apply to successive reorganization events, and the provisions summarized under “—Anti-dilution Adjustments to the FixedSettlement Rates” will 
apply to any shares of common equity or ADRs of us or any successor received by the holders of shares of our Common Stock in any suchreorganization event. 
We (or any successor to us) will, as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within five calendar days) after the occurrence of anyreorganization event p
rovide written notice to the holders of the purchase contracts of such occurrence and of the kind and amount of cash, securities or otherproperty that constitut
e the exchange property. Failure to deliver such notice will not affect the operation of the provisions described in this section.It is possible that cer
tain consolidations, mergers, combinations or other transactions could result in tax gains or losses to the holders either as a result of thetransaction or the conve
rsion thereafter. Holders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the ownership,disposition and settlemen
t of the purchase contracts.Fractional Shares
No fractional shares of our Com
mon Stock will be issued to holders upon settlement of the purchase contracts. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable,holders will be entitled 
to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of our Common Stock, calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of thepurchase contracts being s
ettled (provided  that, so long as the Equity Units ar e in global form, we may elect to aggregate Equity Units for purposes of thesecalculations on any basis pe
rmitted by the applicable procedures of DTC), multiplied by the daily VWAP of our Common Stock on the trad ing day immediatelypreceding the purchase c
ontract settlement date, early settlement date or fundamental change early settlement date, as the case may be.Legal Holidays
In any case where the
 purchase contract settlement date, early settlement date or fundamental change early settlement date, as the case may be, shall not be abusiness day, notwithstanding any ter
m to the contrary in the purchase contract agreement or purchase contract, the settlement of the purchase contracts shall notbe effected on such date, bu
t instead shall be effected on the next succeeding business day with the same force and effect as if made on such settlement date, and nointerest or other amoun
ts shall accrue or be payable by us or to any holder in respect of such delay.
Consequences of BankruptcyPursuant to the terms
 of the purchase contract agreement, the purchase contract settlement date for each purchase contract, whether held separately or as part of anEquity Unit, will automatic
ally accelerate upon the occurrence of specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us. Pursuant to theterms of the purchase con
tract agreement, upon acceleration, holders will be entitled under the terms of the purchase contracts to receive a number of shares of ourCommon Stock per
 purchase contract equal to the maximum settlement rate in effect immediately prior to such acceleration (regardless of the market value of ourCommon Stock at that time). Howeve
r, a bankruptcy court may prevent us from delivering our Common Stock in settlement of the accelerated purchase contracts.In such event, a holder would have a d
amage claim against us for the value of the Common Stock that we would have otherwise been required to deliver uponsettlement of the pur
chase contracts. Any such damage claim that holders have against us following such acceleration will rank pari passu with the claims of holders of our Common Stock in the re
levant bankruptcy proceeding. As such, to the extent we fail to deliver Common Stock to the holder upon such anacceleration, the ho
lder will only be able to recover damages to the extent holders of our Common Stock receive any recovery.Modification
The purchase contract ag
reement contains provisions permitting us and the purchase contract agent to modify the purchase contract agreement or the purchasecontracts without the consen
t of the holders of purchase contracts (whether held separately or as a component of Equity Units) for any of the following purposes:•
to evidence the succession o f another person to us, and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants and obligations of ours in thepurchase contract agr
eement and the units and separate purchase contracts, if any;•
to add to the covenants for th e benefit of holders of purchase contracts or to surrender any of our rights or powers under the agreement;•
to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment of a successor purchase contract agent;•
upon the occurrence of a r eorganization event, solely (i) to provide that each purchase contract will become a contract to purchase exchangeproperty and (ii) to ef
fect the related changes to the terms of the purchase contracts, in each case, as required by the applicable provisions of thepurchase contract agreement;
•
to conform the provisions of th e purchase contract agreement to the “Description of the Purchase Contracts” and “Description of the EquityUnits” sections in the prel
iminary prospectus supplement which forms a part of the registration statement on which the Equity Units areregistered, as supplemen
ted by the related pricing term sheet;•
to cure any ambiguity or m anifest error, to correct or supplement any provisions that may be inconsistent or defective; and•
to make any other provisions with respect to such matters or questions, so long as such action does not adversely affect the interest of the holdersin any material respect.
The purchase contract ag
reement contains provisions permitting us and the purchase contract agent, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority ofthe purchase contracts

Description of the U.S. Treasury Strips Components
The U.S. treasury strips underlying th
e Equity Units are held by the custodian as agent for the holders of the Equity Units and are subject to the terms of a custodialagreement between the 
custodian and purchase contract agent. The following summary contains a description of all of the material terms of the custodial agreementbut is not complete and is subj
ect to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the custodial agreement, including the definitions in thecustodial agreement o
f certain terms. We refer you to the custodial agreement which is incorporated by reference to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Each U.S. treasury strips component wi
ll initially form a part of an Equity Unit. On any business day during the period beginning on, and including, the businessday immediately fol
lowing the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to, but excluding, the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding August 16,2023, the holder will have the r
ight to separate 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiples thereof), and withdraw the U.S. treasury strips underlying thoseEquity Units. Following such separation, U.S. tre
asury strips may be transferred separately from purchase contracts.
Payments of U.S. Treasury StripsThe U.S. treasury strips are held by 
the custodian as agent for the holders of the Equity Units. The custodian will, upon instructions from the purchase contractagent, forward to each holde
r of Equity Units the amount it receives from the U.S. government in respect of each U.S. treasury strip underlying the Equity Unitsowned by such holder on the business day imm
ediately following the date such U.S. treasury strip matures on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15of each year, with such paymen
ts commencing on, and including, August 17, 2020, and ending on, and including, August 16, 2023. We expect that the amountpayable per Equity Unit per fu
ll quarter as described in the immediately preceding sentence will be equal to $1.3750, which represents an annual rate of return onthe stated amount per Equi
ty Unit of 5.50%. The amount payable per Equity Unit on August 17, 2020 was equal to $0.6875. These payments will consist of the prorata amount of all a
mounts received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. treasury strips. So long as the Equity Units remain in the form of one or more book-entry, global Equity Unit cer
tificates as described in “—Book-Entry Procedures and Settlement” below, the record date will be the business day prior to therelevant payment dat
e. If the Equity Units do not remain in the form of one or more book-entry, global Equity Unit certificates, the relevant record date will be thefifteenth day (whether o
r not a business day) prior to the relevant payment date.We have no obligation, responsib
ility or liability with respect to the purchase of the U.S. treasury strips and their delivery into the custody of the custodian, theperformance or non-per
formance of the duties of the custodian or any payment of the U.S. treasury strips components. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC has purchasedthe U.S. treasury strips to be sold to 
the purchasers of the Equity Units and delivered to the custodian, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.Each Equity Unit will initia
lly evidence its holder’s 1/48,000th beneficial ownership interest in the following U.S. treasury strips, which will constitute one U.S.treasury strips component:

The custodian is the agent of 
the holders of the Equity Units evidencing the U.S. treasury strips and is not a trustee, and no trust was intended to be created or wascreated by the terms o
f the custodial agreement. The custodian has no managerial role nor any discretion with respect to the U.S. treasury strips and has no right todeal with the U.S. treasury strips 
except as specifically provided in the custodial agreement. The custodian agrees to hold the U.S. treasury strips and exercise thedue care of a professiona
l custodian for hire. Under the custodial agreement, the custodian is required to remit all payments received from the U.S. government inrespect of the U.S. treasury st
rips to the holders of the Equity Units without making any deduction as instructed by the purchase contract agent.Ownership of U.S. Treasury Strips
The U.S. treasury strips will at a
ll times be the sole and exclusive property of the holders of the Equity Units. The custodian may not transfer, assign, pledge, setoff or otherwise dispose of any of 
the U.S. treasury strips or any interests therein, except as expressly permitted by the provisions of the custodial agreement.
Withdrawal of U.S. Treasury StripsOn any business day during the period beginn
ing on, and including, the business day immediately following the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to, butexcluding, the second scheduled 
trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023, a holder of 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof) will havethe right to separate su
ch Equity Units and withdraw the U.S. treasury strips underlying those Equity Units. To withdraw the U.S. treasury strips underlying EquityUnits, holders must follow the proc
edures outlined under the above caption “Description of the Equity Units—Separating and Recreating Equity Units—SeparatingEquity Units.” The purchase contr
act agent will then (i) cancel the Equity Units and deliver to the holder the purchase contracts evidenced by the Equity Units and(ii) instruct the cus
todian to deliver to the holder such holder’s U.S. treasury strips. Any administrative fees and expenses related to withdrawing the U.S. treasurystrips evidenced by the Equity Uni
ts that are payable to the purchase contract agent or the custodian will be at the expense of the holder of Equity Units requestingwithdrawal. To recreate 
the Equity Units, holders must follow the procedures outlined under the above caption “Description of the Equity Units—Separating andRecreating Equity Units—Recre
ation of Equity Units.” Because each Equity Unit evidences a 1/48,000th beneficial ownership interest in specified U.S. treasurystrips, any separation or r
ecreation of Equity Units may be made only in integral multiples of 48,000 Equity Units.Certain Other Provisions of the Custodial Agreem
entDelivery of U.S. Treasury Strips
Payments of the U.S. treasury strips 
components will be made by the custodian to the depositary as long as the Equity Units remain in book-entry form. Inaddition, if the Equity Units do not 
remain in book-entry form, payments may be made, at the option of the custodian, by check mailed to the address of the personentitled to the paymen
ts as shown on the Equity Unit register.If the purchase contra
ct settlement date is accelerated, U.S. treasury strips will be delivered by the custodian upon presentation and surrender of the Equity Unitcertificates ev
idencing the related Equity Units at the office of the purchase contract agent or, in the case of book-entry Equity Units, upon presentation andsurrender of the Equity Units in 
accordance with the procedures of the depositary. Following such acceleration and delivery, the custodian will sell (or, at theexpense of holders, retain 
the services of a broker dealer that will sell) such U.S. treasury strips, and the custodian will distribute the net cash proceeds of such sale(less any expenses incurred by 
the custodian in connection with such sale) on a pro rata basis to holders of Equity Units (or in accordance with the procedures ofthe depositary in the cas
e of global Equity Units). Until the Equity Unit certificate is presented and surrendered or the holder provides satisfactory evidence that theEquity Unit certifica
te has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the purchase contract agent, the U.S. treasury stripswill be held by the custodian fo
r the account of the holder. The custodian will have no obligation to invest or to pay interest on any amounts held by the custodianpending delivery.
Modification
The custodial agreemen
t contains provisions prohibiting the custodian and the purchase contract agent, except under limited circumstances, from modifying oramending the terms of th
e custodial agreement without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Equity Unit affected by the modification or amendment.Governing Law
The custodial agreemen
t is governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.Information Concerning the Custodian
The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., whose designated off
ice is located at 400 South Hope Street, Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90071, acts as thecustodian of the U.S. treasury str
ips on behalf of the holders of Equity Units from time to time.
The custodial agreement does not obligate the custodian to perform any discretionary actions in connection with the terms of the Equity Units or the custodialagreement. The custodia
l agreement also contains provisions limiting the liability of the custodian and the circumstances under which the custodian may resign orbe replaced. No such resignat
ion or replacement will be effective until a successor custodian is appointed.We maintain banking re
lationships in the ordinary course of business with the custodian and its affiliates.Book Entry Procedures and Settlement
Except in the limited 
circumstances described herein, the Equity Units and the purchase contracts are issued in the form of one or more global Equity Unitcertificates and global purcha
se contract certificates, respectively, held by the purchase contract agent, as custodian for, and registered in the name of, TheDepository Trust Company (“DTC”), as deposit
ary, or its nominee.The depositary has advised us as fo
llows: The depositary is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the Banking Law of the State of New York, amember of the Federal Res
erve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency”registered pursuant to Sec
tion 17A of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The depositary was created to hold securities of itsparticipants (defined belo
w) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entrychanges in accounts 
of the participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. The depositary’s participants include securities brokersand dealers, banks, trust comp
anies, clearing corporations and some other organizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own the depositary. Accessto the depositary’s book-ent
ry system is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodialrelationship with a part
icipant, either directly or indirectly.No Equity Unit represented by global Equ
ity Unit certificates and no purchase contract represented by global purchase contract certificates may be exchanged inwhole or in part for defini
tive Equity Units or purchase contracts, as the case may be, and no transfer of global Equity Unit certificates and global purchase contractcertificates in whol
e or in part may be registered, in the name of any person other than the depositary or any nominee of the depositary unless:•
the depositary has notifi ed the purchase contract agent that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for such global Equity Unitcertificates or g
lobal purchase contract certificates, as the case may be, or has ceased to be qualified to act as such as required by the purchasecontract agreement;
•
there shall have occur red and be continuing a default by us in respect of our obligations under the purchase contract agreement; or•
the beneficial holde r of Equity Units elects to withdraw the U.S. treasury strips evidenced by one or more of its Equity Units and elects to holdthe purchase contracts 
in definitive form.All Equity Units and purchase contr
acts represented by one or more global Equity Unit certificates and global purchase contract certificates, respectively, or anyportion thereof are r
egistered in such names as the depositary may have directed.The laws of some jurisdictions 
require that some purchasers of Equity Units take physical delivery of the Equity Units in definitive form. These laws may impair aholder’s ability to tr
ansfer beneficial interests in Equity Units so long as they are represented by global Equity Unit certificates.As long as the depositary (or its no
minee) is the registered owner of the global Equity Unit certificates and the global purchase contract certificates, the depositary(or its nominee) will be 
considered the sole owner and holder of the global Equity Unit certificates, the global purchase contract certificates and all Equity Unitsand purchase contracts r
epresented thereby for all purposes under the Equity Units and purchase contracts and the purchase contract agreement. Except in thelimited circumstances referred to ab
ove, owners of beneficial interests in global Equity Unit certificates and owners of beneficial interests in global purchasecontract certificates:

•are not be entitled to ha ve the global purchase contract certificates or the purchase contracts represented thereby registered in their respectivenames;
•
will not receive or be e ntitled to receive physical delivery of Equity Unit certificates or purchase contract certificates, as the case may be, inexchange therefor; and
•
are not be considered to be owne rs or holders of global Equity Unit certificates or any Equity Units represented thereby or global purchasecontract certif
icates or any purchase contracts represented thereby, for any purpose under the Equity Units, the purchase contracts or thepurchase contract agreement.
All transfers and delive
ries of shares of our Common Stock (and any cash amount paid by us in lieu of fractional shares) issued on settlement of the purchasecontracts evidenced by th
e Equity Units in global form and all transfers and deliveries of the U.S. treasury strips evidenced by the Equity Units in global form willbe made to the depositary 
(or its nominee) as the holder thereof. All transfers and deliveries of shares of our Common Stock (and any cash amount paid by us inlieu of fractional shares) p
ursuant to the purchase contracts represented by the global purchase contract certificates will be made by the purchase contract agent tothe depositary (or its nom
inee) as the holder thereof. Cash payments in respect of the U.S. treasury strips component of Equity Units in global form will be madeby the custodian, at the dir
ection of the purchase contract agent, to the depositary (or its nominee) as the holder of such Equity Units.Ownership of beneficial int
erests in the global Equity Unit certificates and global purchase contract certificates is limited to participants or persons that may holdbeneficial inter
ests through institutions that have accounts with the depositary or its nominee, which we refer to as participants. Ownership of beneficial interests inglobal Equity Unit certif
icates and global purchase contract certificates will be shown only on, and the transfer of those ownership interests will be effected onlythrough, records maintain
ed by the depositary or its nominee (with respect to participants’ interests) or any such participant (with respect to interests of personsheld by such participants on th
eir behalf). Procedures for settlement of purchase contracts on the purchase contract settlement date or upon early settlement forholders who hold in book-entry form wil
l be governed by arrangements among the depositary, participants and persons that may hold beneficial interests throughparticipants designed to
 permit such settlement without the physical movement of certificates. Payments, transfers, deliveries, exchanges and other matters relatingto beneficial inte
rests in global Equity Unit certificates may be subject to various policies and procedures adopted by the depositary from time to time. None ofPG&E Corporation, the purchase contr
act agent or the custodian or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of thedepositary’s or any parti
cipant’s records relating to, or for payments made on account of, beneficial interests in global Equity Unit certificates or global purchasecontract certif
icates, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of the depositary’s records or any participant’s records relating to such beneficial ownershipinterests.
Notices
So long as the global securiti
es are held on behalf of DTC or any other clearing system, notices to holders of securities represented by a beneficial interest in theglobal securities may b
e given by delivery of the relevant notice to DTC or the alternative clearing system, as the case may be.

 in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for Utility’s disagreement therewith (either such statement,a “
Statement of Objections”). If a party fails to deliver the applicable Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, the Utility Post- Closing Statement or the
 Purchaser Post-Closing Statement, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have been accepted by such party. If a party delivers aStatement
 of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Purchaser and Utility shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections withinthirty
 (30) days after the delivery of the applicable Statement of Objections (the “Initial  Resolution Period”),  and, if the same are so resolved within theInitial
 Resolution Period, the Utility Post-Closing Statement or the Purchaser Post-Closing Statement, as the case may be, so resolved with such changesas may have been previously ag
reed in writing by Purchaser and Utility, shall be final and binding.f.

 Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment and the Utility Post-Closing Statement or the Purchaser Post-ClosingStatement,
 as the case may be. The parties hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent Accountantsshall
 only decide the specific items under dispute by the parties and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the range of values assignedto
 each such item in the Utility Post-Closing Statement or the Purchaser Post-Closing Statement, as the case may be, and the applicable Statement ofObjections.

 Purchaser shall promptly give notice of such payment to Utility and, if applicable, the Independent Accountants, and such payment shall betaken into consideration by 
the parties or, if applicable, the Independent Accountants in determining the Post-Closing Adjustment.h.
The  fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be paid equally by Utility, on the one hand, and by Purchaser, on the otherhand.

The Independent Accountants shal l make a determination as soon as practicable within thirty (30) days (or such other time as the partiesshall
 agree in writing) after their engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their adjustments to the Utility Post-Closing Statement,the Purchaser Post-
    

Closing Statement, or the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.j.
Except  as  otherwise  provided  herein,  any  payment  of  the  Post-Closing  Adjustment  shall  (i)  be  due  (A)  if  there  are  no  DisputedAmounts,
 within five (5) Business Days following acceptance of the Utility Post-Closing Statement and the Purchaser Post-Closing Statement, or (B) ifthere
 are Disputed Amounts, then within five (5) Business Days of the resolution described in Section 2.3(i)  above;  and (ii) be paid by wire transfer ofimmediately
 available funds to such account as is directed by Purchaser or Utility, as the case may be. To the extent that any such payment is due toUtility, Purchaser and Utility shall provide joint
 written instructions to the Escrow Agent to make such payment first from the Escrow Account, and to theextent
 that such payment exceeds the amount in the Escrow Account, Purchaser shall pay such excess amount to Utility. To the extent the amount in theEscrow
 Account deposited pursuant to Section 2.3(a)  exceeds  the amount of any such payment owed to Utility, Purchaser and Utility shall provide jointwritten instructions to th
e Escrow Agent to release such excess amount to Purchaser.k.

 is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of such a party (including any domestic or foreign court, government, or Governmental Authority orinstrumentality,
 federal, state or local) (a “Third  Party Claim”)  against such Indemnified Party, against which a party to this Agreement is required toprovide indemnificat
ion under this    

Agreement (an “Indemnifying  Party”),  the Indemnified Party shall give written notice together with a statement of any available information regardingsuch
 claim, and copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim, to theIndemnifying
 Party within thirty (30) days after learning of such claim (or within such shorter time as may be necessary to give the Indemnifying Party areasonable opportunity to
 respond to such claim). The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party (the “Defense Notice”
) within thirty (30) days af ter receipt from the Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, to conduct at its expense and with counsel selected by theIndemnifying Party the def
ense against such Third Party Claim in its own name, or if necessary in the name of the Indemnified Party.b.
In the event that  the Indemnifying Party shall fail to give such a Defense Notice within thirty (30) days, then the Indemnified Party maycontrol the defense of such Th

 such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party’s prior written consent. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, theIndemnifying
 Party will not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim or cease to defend against such claim if pursuant to or as a result of suchsettlement
 or cessation (i) injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnified Party, or (ii) such settlement or cessation wouldlead

 the specific provisions of this Agreement claimed to have been breached, the factual basis supporting the contention that such provisions were breached, theamount
 or the estimated  amount of damages sought thereunder, any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating  thereto and, to theextent
 practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto (a “Direct  Claim Notice”).  The Indemnifying Party shall have a period of thirty (30) days withinwhich
 to respond to any Direct Claim Notice, stating whether it disputes the existence or scope of an obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party under thisArticle 7
.  If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such thirty (30) day period stating that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability for such claim,the Indemnifying
 Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be availableto
 the  Indemnified  Party  on  the  terms  and  subject  to  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement.  If  the  Indemnifying  Party  disputes  all  or  any  part  of  such  claim,  theIndemnified
 Party and the Indemnifying Party shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30) days to resolve such claim. If no such agreement can be reached throughgood
 faith negotiation within thirty (30) days, either the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party may act to resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 9.4

fied Party’s rights of recovery to the extent of any such Claim satisfied by the Indemnifying Party. In furtherance of Section 5.6  of this Agreement, the Indemnif
ied Party shall execute and    

deliver  such  instruments  and  papers  as  are  necessary  to  assign  such  rights  and  assist  in  the  exercise  thereof,  including  access  to  books  and  records  as  theIndemnifying Party may re

ayments made under this Guaranty until all Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid and discharged in full.Guarantor is executing this Gua

Getting StartedYour Relocation 
Handbook PG&E has established this relocation handbook to assist in the financial and service needs of employees who meet the eligibility
requirements and wish to relocate. The handbook is designed to address most events in a typical relocation and is intended to ease
the transition to the new location for you and your family.
This handbook outlines the various benefits available to you. We suggest that you review it carefully and make note of any questions
you have or further information you may need.
Important Notices
•
PG&E reserves the right to interpret, at its sole discretion, the provisions of this program and to amend, limit or change any ofits provisions with or without prior notice.
•
Nothing in this handbook should be interpreted as an employment guarantee or as creating an employment contract, expressedor implied, for any duration.
•
The intent of the relocation program is to provide reasonable, consistent and cost effective financial assistance and qualityservices to employees who relocate. The handbook does not offer or imply that all relocation costs will be fully compensated.
•
This relocation program has been designed to provide tax benefits and cost savings for you and PG&E. If you choose to workoutside the guidelines, certain benefits may not be available to you.

It is expected that you will make every effort to transfer promptly and control the cost of your move whenever possible. Youwill be reimbursed for reasonable, necessary and properly authorized eligible expenses. You are expected to maintain expenses
at a conservative level and to be familiar with which expenses are reimbursable. The Company may, at its discretion, choose not
to reimburse, in full or in part, an expense that is deemed unreasonable or excessive.
Time Off
 for Relocation NeedsThe decision to grant time off from work for relocation-related activities is a business decision, and employees are encouraged to
discuss needs with their supervisor. The decision to grant time off with pay and the charge of the time off with pay is up to the
individual department. Recommendation is not to exceed 5 days over the course of the 12-month relocation.

Miscellaneous Expense AllowancePG&E’s relocation program does not cover every expense you are likely to incur during your move. To help you with these various
costs, PG&E provides a Miscellaneous Expense Allowance (MEA) of $7,000 (less applicable gross earning taxes—no gross-up is
provided).
The MEA is yours to use as you wish, and no receipt submission to the RMC or PG&E is required. However, you may need to keep
receipts for your personal tax records. If in doubt, keep your receipts and talk to a tax advisor.
The MEA will be distributed directly to you by PG&E through Payroll. The RMC will notify PG&E to initiate the payment once
your signed Repayment Agreement has been received and you have started work in your new location. If you are a current
employee, the position change or other transactions must be completed in SAP prior to payment.
The MEA may be used to help with expenses such as:
•
Storage or shipment of household goods outside of the parameters outlined in this handbook•
Alcohol, wine and wine cellar shipment•
Tips to movers•
Travel expenses not covered by relocation handbook, e.g., airline upgrade fees, preferred seat fees, baggage fees for the homefinding trip, and bags in excess of two per person for the final move trip, etc.
•
Concessions negotiated in the sale of a home•
Express mail charges (Federal Express, UPS, Airborne Express, etc.); notary fees, etc.•
Personal telephone calls (long distance, cell phone charges)•
Repairs, decorating, installation, wiring, cleaning, landscaping, etc. expenses for old or new home•
Security or utility deposits•
Automobile registration fees, licenses, or smog control charges•
Losses of fees for subscriptions, memberships, schools, safety deposit box•
Child care expenses•
Spouse/domestic partner employment costs•
Pet deposits or moving and boarding of pets•
Laundry and cleaning•
Tax obligations not fully compensated by gross-up•
GPS and other upgrades not standard for your rental car
Lease CancellationIf you are a renter and have a lease to cancel in the departure location, you will be reimbursed for up to 2 months' rent.  Your lease
must have been signed prior to the date of the official relocation.  The intent of this benefit is to cover lease cancellation fees, but not
unused rent (i.e. if you are responsible for rent through a given month and move out midway through the month, the balance of that
month's rent is not considered reimbursable as "lease cancellation").
Following is the documentation that you will need to submit for reimbursement:
•
A copy of the current lease signed by the landlord and tenant(s)•
A copy of the notice to vacate letter that you provided to the landlord or property manager, which includes the date youintend to vacate
•
A response back from your landlord with the dollar amount required to break the lease and confirmation that you havevacated and turned in your keys.  The landlord will need to outline the costs (i.e. rent, break fee, etc.), associated with
breaking the lease.
•
Proof of payment of the amount you paid to the landlord for the lease break.  This can be in the form of a cancelled check(front and back), credit card or bank statement showing the charge, or a signed/dated receipt from the landlord showing what
was paid.
Upload all of the above documents to the website at 
www.altairglobal.com  for reimbursement consideration.  Please provide all required documents together to avoid delays in reviewing your reimbursement.
Relocation Clause
If you decide to rent rather than purchase a home in the new location, you should include a relocation clause in your new lease that
allows you to terminate the lease without penalty upon future relocation. The following example may be used:
It is understood the Lessee is subject to transfer by his or her employer. Accordingly, it is agreed in the
event of Lessee’s transfer at any time prior to the date on which the last monthly rental payment under this
Lease becomes due, Lessor will release Lessee of and from all further obligations under the Lease as of the
last day of the monthly rental period during which Lessee vacates the premises, provided the Lessee gives
written notice to the Lessor 30 days prior to vacating.

Home Sale Assistance ProgramFor homeowners, the sale of your home may be one of the most critical factors in accomplishing a successful relocation. The Home
Sale Assistance Program is structured to save money for you and PG&E by providing you the opportunity for significant tax savings.
You Must Work with Altair
To receive home sale benefits you must contact PG&E’s Relocation Management Company (RMC), Altair, for referral to
approved real estate agents in connection with the purchase and/or sale of your residence. You must comply with the Home

home on your own. You will still receive direct reimbursement for reasonable and customary home sales expenses. 
For reference, a list of reasonable and customary home sale expenses covered by PG&E can be found on page 13.
 Your home sales expense reimbursement will be grossed up.
If your home is eligible for the Home Sale Assistance Program
In accordance with the criteria listed above and you choose 
not  to participate in the Home Sale Assistance Program, you will stillreceive reimbursement for reasonable and customary home sale expenses; however, 
none of the expenses of the transaction will be grossed up.

Step-by-Step Guide to Home Sale Assistance ProgramYou must follow these steps carefully to ensure compliance with the Home Sale Assistance Program. 
If these steps are altered in any way, your home sale assistance benefits may be at risk.
Step 1:    Speak with your RMC consultant before signing any agreement(s) with real esta
te professionals regardingthe sale of your home.
As soon as PG&E authorizes the RMC to provide services, your consultant will contact you to conduct an initial interview. This
interview will include discussion of all aspects of your relocation benefits and the needs that you anticipate for your family during
the relocation process.
Step 2:    Broker’s Market Analysis
After the initial interview, your consultant will order two Broker’s Market Analyses of your home and review them with you. A
Broker’s Market Analysis (BMA) is performed by a real estate broker on the basis of his or her knowledge of the current real estate
resale activity in the community. Each Analysis will compare your home with other similar, recently sold homes to attempt to
answer the question:
“What will the home sell for in the next three to four months, as is, with usual financing for the area?”
The average value of the BMAs will be the basis for the initial listing price for your home under the Home Sale Assistance Program.
The home should be listed for no more than 5% over the average of the two BMAs’ most probable sales price. (Following the
appraisal process, you will need to adjust your list price so that it is not more than 5% over the value provided in your Guaranteed
Purchase Offer.) Adherence to the Home Sale Assistance Program requirements, including list price caps, is necessary to receive the
home sale assistance and home purchase benefits outlined in this handbook.
Step 3:    Selecting a broker or agent to sell your home
You may want to list your home with one of the brokers who provided a BMA, but you are not required to do so. Talk over your
broker preferences with your RMC consultant. If you wish to consider additional brokers, the RMC will provide referrals. You are
free to choose a broker or agent you already know, subject to RMC approval. Approval must be granted before you take any action
regarding the price, terms and service requirements of the listing. In addition, your agent may not be your relative (defined as a
parent, child, spouse, domestic partner, sibling, in-law, stepparent, stepchild, grandparent, or grandchild) as it is a conflict of interest
for the Company to reimburse members of a relocating family for services (commission) connected with the sale of the old home or
purchase of a new home.
Step 4:    Listing your home for sale

After you have chosen a broker or agent, you will be asked to sign a listing agreement. The following “Exclusion Clause” must beincluded as a signed addendum to your listing agreement:
“It is understood and agreed that regardless of whether or not an offer is presented by a ready, willing and able buyer:
(1)    
That no commission or compensation is earned by, or is due and payable to, broker until sale of the property has been consummated between seller and buyer, the deed delivered to the buyer and the purchase price delivered to the seller;
and
(2)    That the seller reserves the right to sell the property to Altair Global or any other person(s) designated by Altair
(individually and collectively a “Named Prospective Purchaser”) at any time upon which this listing agreement shall
terminate without obligation by Altair or the parties to this agreement and no commission or compensation will be
due.”
The exclusion clause must be attached to the listing agreement as a signed addendum. 
This clause will prevent PG&E from paying the listing broker double commission when the home is sold.
The commission may not exceed 6% without prior approval from PG&E. The term of any listing agreement should not
exceed 90 days.
 Your RMC consultant may recommend a shorter term under certain circumstances. Establish a realistic list price for the home. 
Your RMC consultant will offer advice on the best listing and selling prices, based on current market data provided by real estate professionals in the community. You are encouraged to participate in this process by
providing relevant data to the brokers chosen to assess value. The advantages of a competitive listing price will be explained fully by
your consultant.
You must complete a home sale disclosure statement. Every home seller has certain legal duties and obligations to a buyer, including
full disclosure of all pertinent information about the condition of the home and its surroundings. If the RMC inadvertently or without
proper disclosure information purchases a home ineligible for the Home Sale Assistance program, and PG&E incurs a loss as a result
of your omission or misrepresentation of information, you must repay PG&E any current and future out-of-pocket expenses, and/or
fines or legal judgments paid or to be paid by PG&E with regard to the property.
You must not sign any purchase offers or accept any earnest money. Your relocation consultant will instruct you on how to proceed.
Step 5:    Work closely with the broker and the RMC to locate a buyer for your home.
Your RMC consultant will work directly with the real estate broker or agent to monitor progress in marketing your home. The
consultant will make constructive suggestions and note any market activity that might impact the sales strategy. You will be
contacted regularly by the consultant to discuss current information and revise the sales strategy as needed. You are encouraged to
carefully evaluate these recommendations, but you are not required to accept them.
Step 6:    Review any purchase offers on the home with your RMC consultant.

Signing any purchase offer or accepting any earnest money deposits from a buyer or broker prior to speaking with yourRMC consultant will place your Home Sale Assistance benefits at risk.
You should contact your RMC consultant immediately when you receive any offer to purchase your home. Your consultant is
available by phone toll-free during office hours or after hours by calling the number listed on his or her business card, and he or she
will tell you what to do if the offer is acceptable to you.
If an offer from a buyer is acceptable, the RMC will sign the contracts. The RMC’s obligation to you and PG&E is to determine if
the buyer is qualified and if the offer is bona fide before approving the contract.
It is important to proceed with care in evaluating a purchase offer because some costs may not be reimbursable.
 If the buyer’s purchase offer requires the seller to pay any concessions or buyer’s expenses at closing those cost
s will be deducted from yourequity. The following list provides guidelines for consideration as you negotiate a purchase offer; however, you should consult your
RMC consultant if there is any question about whether a cost will be paid under PG&E’s relocation benefit program.

Pest controlStep 7:    Amended Value Sale
Amended Value Sale is a procedure that will be used when you find a buyer for your home. The Amended Value Sale Program
consists of two separate, arm’s length transactions:

•The RMC purchases the home from you at the same net price and terms as the bona fide offer that you have received from abuyer. Once the sale to the RMC closes and you vacate the home, subject to disclosure obligations, you are no longer financially
or legally responsible for the home.
•
The RMC, as the owner of the property, sells the home at the previously offered price to the buyer who made the offer. Ifsomething should happen to prevent this second sale from taking place, you are not affected.
Because the RMC, on behalf of PG&E, is buying your home based on the value of the offer you have received, the RMC must be
sure that the offer is bona fide and that the buyer is ready, willing and able to purchase your home. Your consultant will work closely
with you and your broker as you consider any offers to be sure that the terms are acceptable to the RMC and PG&E.
In order for an offer to be eligible for the Amended Value Sale Program, it must meet certain requirements, including:
•
The contract of sale from the buyer must specify a closing date that is within 60 days of the contract date.•
The contract must not be contingent on the sale of the purchaser’s home. It can, however, be contingent on a closing scheduledto occur within thirty (30) days of the contract date.
•
The contract must not contain other contingencies, with the exception of inspections and buyer’s approval for financing.If the RMC cannot accept the contract of sale because the buyer is not qualified with a bona fide offer, you must continue to market
the home. If you choose to accept the contract of sale with the buyer against the recommendation of the RMC, you will be
responsible for managing the process as an independent sale, outside of the Home Sale Assistance Program. In this case, you will
still receive direct reimbursement for reasonable and customary home sale expenses; however, 
none of the expenses of the transaction will be grossed up.
Step 8:    Closing an Amended Value Sale
When an acceptable offer to purchase the home has been received, documents previously sent by the RMC will require immediate
attention. The documents will include a contract of sale between you and the RMC, certain financial information forms and a general
warranty deed that will subsequently be used by the RMC to convey title. Your consultant will offer specific advice as required, but
you (and your spouse, if applicable) should plan to execute the documents as soon as possible before a Notary Public and return
them to your RMC consultant. It will not be necessary for you to attend the closing of the sale.
You will receive your equity directly from the RMC when the Contract of Sale documents are signed or the property is vacated,
whichever is later. Payment will be by either check or electronic transfer. You will also receive a detailed equity statement by email,
mail, or fax explaining every adjustment to the equity. In general, the equity will be calculated as follows:
Guide for Calculation of Equity
To determine the total “net” cash
value of any transaction on the
home under the Home Sale
Assistance Program, first add
together:
1.    The purchase price appearing in the RMC’s contract of sale, wherein you are the seller andthe RMC is the purchaser.
2.    Any amounts you have prepaid for which you are entitled to receive a prorated refund,
such as interest and taxes, but excluding home casualty insurance.
Then subtract from the above the
total of the following amounts (if
any) that are applicable:
1.    All outstanding indebtedness (mortgages, tax liens, judgments, etc.)2.    Charges for prorated items such as interest and taxes through the effective date of the
contract of sale between you and the RMC or through the vacate date, whichever is later.
3.    Concessions to which you agreed as the seller.
4.    Costs for deferred maintenance/repairs to be completed before the home can be purchased.
5.    A vacate holdback of $500, refundable to you after you have permanently vacated the
property and the RMC has verified property condition.
The difference is:
The net equity under the Company relocation program. 
Step 9:    Cost of OwnershipThe sale price in the Contract of Sale between you and the RMC will reflect the cost of ownership of the home (property insurance,
taxes, utilities, maintenance and interest on the mortgage) 
through the effective date of the contract of sale between you and the RMC or the vacate date, whichever is later. 
The equity statement from the RMC will provide a detailed accounting of your home sale transaction.
It is acceptable to cancel your property insurance as of your vacate or acceptance date, whichever is later. However, for liability
purposes it is recommended that your property insurance remain in effect until your new policy is in force
. It is your responsibility to contact your insurance carrier to advise them of cancellation.
Your RMC consultant will advise you when to discontinue making mortgage and other payments. If you have arrangements with any
lender for payments to be automatically deducted from your account, it will be your responsibility to cancel the automatic draft(s) as
of your acceptance or vacate date whichever is later. 
It is imperative you discuss with your RMC consultant when to send this form to your lender. 
If you fail to cancel your automatic draft(s), refunds for overpayments will be delayed until after closing. Step 10:    Vacating the Home
If you vacate prior to closing, your real estate broker will make arrangements to pick up your house keys, warranties, garage door
opener controls and other such necessities. Your consultant will notify you when to transfer utilities to the broker’s name, but do not
request the utilities be turned off as this will result in reconnect charges. Please be sure to contact the utility companies to provide
your forwarding address for your final bills.
Regardless of whether you vacate before or after closing, it will be necessary to leave the home in cleanly swept condition. In order
to avoid paying additional cleaning charges later, the home must be clean and you must remove all personal property, trash or debris.
Cleaning charges will be withheld from the refund of your “vacate holdback” (Step 8, item 5 in the Guide for Calculation of Equity)
if necessary.
Tax Liability
The majority of expenditures associated with this benefit are not reported as gross earnings; thus no gross-up is neces
sary providedthe home sells under the Amended Value Sale program. The only exception to this is the expenditures associated with the deed and
transfer tax of the property in some states.
Guaranteed Purchase Offer
Once your home is listed under the Home Sale Assistance Program, the RMC will guarantee to purchase your home at a price based
on objective relocation appraisals. With this Guaranteed Purchase Offer (GPO), it is possible for you to move with confidence,
knowing you may accept the RMC’s offer if further marketing under the Home Sale Assistance Program does not bring an
acceptable outside buyer.
Required Marketing Period

You are required to market your home under the Home Sale Assistance Program for 60 days before you may accept the GuaranteedPurchase Offer. The required marketing period begins on the day you list your home for sale under the Home Sale Assistance
Program.
Relocation Appraisals determine the value of the Guaranteed Purchase Offer.
When you have begun to market your home under the Home Sale Assistance Program, you will be asked to select appraisers from a
list presented by your RMC consultant. The appraisers will be local, independent appraisers who, once selected, will be hired by the
RMC to appraise your home.
The primary intent of PG&E’s Home Sale Assistance Program is to assist you in locating a buyer, not to purchase and re-sell your
home. Therefore, the appraisers are asked to objectively evaluate your home in order to estimate the 
most probable selling price after reasonable market exposure.
 This definition of value differs from a bank or mortgage appraisal and may also differ from what a specific buyer might be willing to pay for your home. The GPO is provided as a fall-back offer, available to you if you do not
locate a buyer. Through the RMC, PG&E will purchase your home at a price that should enable the RMC to re-sell it within a
reasonable amount of time.
You will be thoroughly briefed on the content of the appraisals by your relocation consultant.
The amount of the Guaranteed Purchase Offer will be the average of the two appraisal values. If the lower value of the two
appraisals is not within 5% of the higher value, the RMC will ask you to select another appraiser and will order a third appraisal.
When this occurs, the Guaranteed Purchase Offer amount will be the average of the 
two closest values.  (The Brokers’ Market Analyses, discussed previously in the “Home Sale Assistance Program” section, will 
not  be included in the average.)The appraised value is contingent on the results of any customary and required inspections. Repairs identified through these
inspections are your financial responsibility. Repairs must be completed before equity is released or the cost of repairs will be
deducted from your equity. Repairs are subject to re-inspection. Repairs identified will be defects (i.e., leaks, faulty furnace or water
heater, etc.) and do not include cosmetic items such as painting or replacing carpet, unless those items are required by a lender.
In the process of appraising your home, the appraisers will review comparable sales selected from a multiple listing service or
similar directory. You are encouraged to provide appraisers with a list of recent, comparable sales or other related data that may be
useful in assessing the value of your home.
Within seven days of receiving your Guaranteed Purchase Offer, you must reduce your list price to no more than 105% of the GPO
amount. Adherence to the Home Sale Assistance Program guidelines, including list price caps, is necessary to receive the home sale
and home purchase benefits outlined in this handbook.
Accepting the Guaranteed Purchase Offer
You may accept the GPO at the end of the 60-day marketing period, or you may continue to market the home until the end of the
acceptance period of the GPO. The acceptance period of the GPO is 60 days, beginning with the date of the offer (not necessarily the
same date as the marketing period begins).
To accept the GPO, execute the contracts and all associated documents (which may differ depending on which state the home is
located). Several of the documents will require the

acknowledgment of a Notary Public. All documents must be in the RMC’s possession before the end of the 60th day.The equity payments based on the GPO will be made on the later of either the contract date (when the contract is signed by your
relocation consultant) or the date the home is vacated. Allow five (5) business days after the RMC receives paperwork for payment
of the equity. The RMC will deliver the equity check to you by overnight service or wire the funds directly to the account.
Amended Value Sale
If, before accepting your GPO, you receive an offer from an outside buyer that you wish to consider, work with your broker and
your RMC consultant to negotiate the offer so that it may be closed as an Amended Value Sale. (See previous discussion of this
procedure in the “Home Sale Assistance Program.”)
Home Sale Incentive
Should you receive an offer from an outside buyer that is less than the GPO amount, terms may be negotiated for an amended value
sales price that is no less than 95% of the GPO amount. In this case, you may accept this offer and still receive the full amount of the
GPO. You will also receive a bonus of 1% of the negotiated sales price, up to a maximum of $10,000, less applicable taxes.
Possession Period
You will be given thirty (30) days from acceptance of the GPO or Amended Value Sale to vacate the property.
Proration Date
If you accept the GPO, you will be responsible for insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance, principal and interest on the mortgage
through the date of acceptance of the GPO or the date the property is vacated whichever is later.
Pass-back of Gain or Loss on Sale to Employee
Under the terms dictated by the Internal Revenue Service, if the employee accepts the GPO and the property ultimately sells for
more than the employee’s GPO buyout, a pass-back of a gain (or a loss) is not permitted. The sales are treated as two separate sales
transactions and cannot be related.
Tax Liability
The majority of expenditures associated with the GPO benefit are not reported as gross earnings; thus no gross-up is necessary
provided the home sells under the Guaranteed Purchase Offer program. The only exception to this is the expenditures associated
with the deed and transfer tax of the property in some states.
However, the Home Sale Incentive is reported as additional gross earnings. No tax assistance is available and appropriate taxes will
be withheld.

Equity AdvanceThe Company may grant you an equity advance in the form of a loan for up to 90% of the equity in your current home when the
equity is required to guarantee a contract on a home in the new location. The advance is made to accommodate your being
transferred at the request of the Company, and it is not a mortgage loan. The following guidelines apply:
•
The advance will equal no more than 90% of the equity based on the Guaranteed Purchase Offer.•
The total amount of the advance must be used exclusively toward the purchase of a new residence.•
You must sign a promissory note and agree to repay the advance upon completion of the sale of the former residence. The termof the promissory note is 120 days.
If you are an executive of the Company as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, your equity will be disbursed at the time you
accept the Guaranteed Purchase Offer and execute the required paperwork.
Tax Liability
This benefit is not reported as gross earnings, and no gross-up is necessary.
New Home Finding Assistance
Do not contact any real estate professional at the destination without the guidance of your RMC consultant. 
When you are ready to visit your destination to look for suitable housing, the RMC must arrange your travel and lodging and take care of many of
the details for you.
PG&E will provide you with assistance in searching for your new residence. Specifically:
•
Before you depart to look for housing in the new location, your RMC consultant will ask you for detailed informationconcerning your housing preferences, price range and family requirements.
•
If you wish to rent, the RMC will arrange for a rental service or a real estate broker to assist you in locating the right place foryou.
•
If you choose to purchase a home, a real estate broker will arrange for house-hunting tours for every day you are in the area.You will be escorted to neighborhoods and homes of interest to you. Through your broker or agent, you will see homes targeted
to meet your goals and needs.
Rental Assistance
In order to assist employees who intend to rent or lease a home or apartment in the new location, one full day tour with a rental
finding company/brokerage will be provided. Your RMC consultant can assign you to a qualified local company in your destination
area to provide you with the following information:
•
General availability of apartments, houses, and condominiums for rent and the range of rental rates•
Local real estate practices governing such matters as who prepares the lease, the amount of commission if any, and the securitydeposit required

Home Search TripYou and your spouse/registered domestic partner may take up to two home search trips for a maximum of eight days, seven nights
total. Dependent children who will be relocating to the destination with the family will also be eligible for one home finding trip.
The following conditions apply to travel expense reimbursement:
•
All travel arrangements must be made through the RMC.•
Itemized receipts are required for reimbursement. Submit the Expense Report through the RMC’s website.•
Airline reservations should be made a minimum of seven days in advance. If you wish to drive, you will be reimbursed mileageat the current IRS rate for business travel.
•

Expenses for transportation to and from the airport, parking, and tolls will be reimbursed in accordance with the Companybusiness travel policy.
•

Expenses for car rental and gas will be reimbursed. Expenses for a GPS or upgrades not standard for the rental car will not bereimbursed.
•
Meals up to $75 per day per adults and children aged 16 and older and $40 per day per child under the age of 16. Costs foralcoholic beverages will not be reimbursed. Itemized receipts are required for reimbursement.
•
Do not use your corporate credit cards for relocation expenses. In addition, do not use your company car for activities related torelocation, as the IRS considers such use as taxable income to you.
•
Cancellations for rental tours require a 48-hour notice. Charges will apply if the 48 notice is not provided. Continuedcancellations may result in loss of benefit or future tours conducted at an out of pocket expense.
Business Expenses
Should you incur business expenses during the home finding trip, these expenses must be segregated from relocation expenses and
submitted to PG&E separately to avoid relocation tax liability.
Tax Liability
New Home Finding benefits are reported as additional gross earnings and the amount is grossed up to help offset additional taxes.
Lender Referral
One of the critical aspects of buying a new home is obtaining mortgage financing. The RMC will provide you with a list of
representatives of selected local and national mortgage companies that will offer loan programs for your use. You are not required to
use any of the lenders referred by the

RMC, but they typically offer mortgages at competitive interest rates and reduced fees. Your designated mortgage company willprovide details on financing your transaction.
Home Purchase Closing Costs
You are eligible for reimbursement of normal closing costs when you purchase a home at the new location. To receive this benefit,
you must close the purchase of your new home within one year of your report date at the destination location. 
To receive home purchase benefits, you must contact PG&E’s Relocation Management Company (RMC), Altair, for referral to approved real
estate agents in connection with the purchase of your residence. You must comply with the Home Purchase requirements,
which includes your agent paying a referral fee to the RMC, or you will not be eligible to receive your closing cost benefits.
Closing Procedures
Your mortgage company will provide details on financing your transaction.
Your consultant will review your closing documents to make certain that the charges are in order, consistent with your negotiated
purchase contract and within the limits of reimbursements that will be paid by PG&E.
All eligible costs will be paid by the RMC at closing so that all you need to provide when you close the purchase of your home is the
down payment and any concessions or other non-eligible costs.

Household Goods MovingYour belongings will be shipped by one of the RMC’s select moving companies.
Your consultant will arrange for the van line’s household goods move coordinator to contact you and provide you with details
surrounding the movement of your household goods. The moving company will need sufficient time to properly coordinate your
move. 
A minimum notice of 30 working days is required . During holidays and summer months, more lead-time is required. Packing and loading dates will be arranged with every attempt made to provide these services on the dates you request. However, keep in
mind that PG&E will not authorize or reimburse additional costs of weekend or holiday service. If you request a weekend or holiday
move, the overtime charges will be collected directly from you upon delivery. You are required to inventory items being moved and
check them off when you arrive in the destination. You or a designated representative should be present during packing, unpacking
and loading, unloading. Additional details provided in the section on Important Information Concerning Household Goods
Shipments.
Insurance
Replacement cost insurance up to $100,000 is provided at no cost to you. If you require additional coverage in excess of that
provided, the cost will be billed to you by the RMC.
Moving Services
The selected household goods carrier will pack, load, insure, transport, deliver and unpack your normal household goods. There are
some limits to this service. Furniture and boxes will be placed in your home where specified, and the contents of your boxes will be
unpacked and placed on the closest flat surface, if requested. Unpacking beyond this description is considered a settling-in service or
maid service and may be obtained from the moving company at an additional cost to you.
Depending on the complexity of services you require, some additional services may be performed by your moving company or a
third-party service firm when deemed necessary by the RMC and within reasonable costs. Such “third-party” services, including
crating, will be considered for normal household goods only and will not include service for items affixed to the property.
It is strongly recommended that you take advantage of the packing services provided by this handbook. If you pack yourself, no cost
saving is realized and none of the goods that you pack will be insured.
If you are unavailable for a pick-up or delivery and do not notify movers in advance, any additional charge will be billed to you.
Some examples of items typically covered for crating are: marble/glass top tables, mirrors and glass shelves.
Items 
not covered: artwork, taxidermy, aquariums, yard art, fountains and chandeliers.These lists are not all inclusive. If you have any items that are not covered for crating, you may use your Miscellaneous Allowance
to pay the 3
 party company directly Household Goods Storage
rd
Storage of household goods and personal effects in transit will be covered up to 90 days, but only if storage is unavoidable . If storage is required for more than 90 days or if you need to access any stored items, the charge will be billed to you.
You will be responsible for costs beyond the time period allowed by this handbook.
Transportation of Automobiles
PG&E will pay for shipping up to two personal automobiles within the U.S. if the move is 
greater than 400 miles.  The vehicles must be in working order and must fit on a standard car carrier or moving van. The value of the vehicles to be moved must exceed
the cost of shipment.
If the move is less than 400 miles, you are required to drive the cars you own to the new location or ship them at your own expense.
Mileage and tolls via the most commonly used direct route will be reimbursed at the current IRS rate.
Disconnecting and Connecting Appliances/Utilities
PG&E will cover the cost of disconnecting and connecting normal household appliances or any other article requiring special
servicing for safe transportation. Appliances include washer, dryer, refrigerator, and icemaker. However, the extension of any gas or
electric lines or adding service for mismatched appliances (i.e., converting an electric hook-up for a gas appliance) is excluded.
Special or Extraordinary Shipping Requirements Are Your Responsibility
Plans should be made in advance for items requiring special or extraordinary handling. These shipping arrangements and the costs
will be your responsibility, but call your household goods move coordinator or your relocation consultant for advice.
PG&E will not pay for charges by the moving company to pick up any furnishings or material at any site other than your primary
residence. You will be billed directly for this additional service.

•
Valuables such as jewelry, coin and stamp collections, computer programs, currency, precious metals, gems or semi-preciousstones, rare documents, or most other collectibles should be set aside and transported with you when you travel. Only under
certain very specific conditions is the mover responsible for these items. Be certain to ask the representative of your moving
company about transporting valuables when he or she visits your home to inventory your belongings.
•
Firearms may be transported, but must be unloaded, packed separately and inventoried by type of firearm and serial number.The inventory must be included in the documentation of the move. This is for your protection as well as the protection of the
mover. You will be responsible for meeting the licensing or registration requirements, if any, of the state where you are moving.
You cannot ship live ammunition via household goods movers.
•
Accompany the mover through the home as he or she inventories and tags each item to be moved. Plan to check off the items atthe destination as well; otherwise, you may have difficulty with claims settlements should they prove necessary.
•
You or your representative should be present during packing and loading. Do not release the drivers until a complete inspectionof the home and property has been accomplished, since items left behind could result in extra charges to you.
•
Detach items that are to be moved, such as televisions, wall-mounted can openers and coffee makers, pictures, posters, curtainrods, attached bookcases and the like. Unplug appliances and electrical devices such as stereos and computers; if possible, 
stowthe connecting cords and cables.
•
Remove all items from refrigerators. Unplug, defrost, clean and let stand open to dry at least 24 hours in advance of loading.•
Items that cannot be moved by your household goods mover:
•Bleach•
Propane tanks or butane tanks•
Flammable or combustible items of any kind, including gas and oil in lawn mowers, edgers and other yard or utilityequipment
•
Open liquids of any kind•
Frozen foods•
Aerosol cans or paints•
No mover will accept liability for moving plants. If you choose to allow the mover to move your plants, you do so at your ownrisk.
Note: 
Federal regulations require that plants moved interstate be inspected and certified free of pests and diseases. The states of California, Arizona and Florida are especially diligent in enforcing their agriculture laws. Taking plants into these states may
require considerable extra expense and effort.
•
If you have items in temporary storage, please give the shipper maximum possible advance notice of the date you preferdelivery. Fourteen days is recommended to ensure the availability of your preferred dates.
•
Keep your utilities on at the old location until at least the day after the scheduled completion of packing and loading.•
In the event damage occurs during the shipment of your goods, please advise your relocation consultant within 30 days fromyour final delivery date. All claims must be submitted within 90 days of delivery date.
Tax Liability
Household goods moving and storage expenses are reported as additional gross earnings and the amount will be grossed up to help
offset additional taxes.

Temporary Living ExpensesIf you assume duties at the new location before your new home is available for occupancy, the RMC will arrange for temporary
accommodations in corporate housing for up to six months as long as you are still financially responsible for your former residence.
Temporary living must be arranged through the RMC.
Only lodging expenses will be covered, this includes one parking space at the temporary housing unit.
If temporary housing that allows pets is available, you are responsible for pet deposits, related fees, etc.
You are eligible for a rental car for up to 14 days while your personal auto is in transit. The rental car can be arranged through
Altair’s Travel Department and direct billed to Altair.
Trips Home
The Trip Home benefit is intended to provide you (the employee) with one trip back to your former residence so that you can meet
with movers and assist your family with the final move.
You will be eligible for a maximum of two round trips for you, the employee, to return to the departure location OR your
spouse/registered domestic partner to visit the destination location. Only round trip airfare or mileage (the most direct route driving
at least 400 miles per day) is eligible for reimbursement for your Trip Home benefit. Items that will not be reimbursed include;
transportation to and from the airport, parking, meals and baggage fees. The Miscellaneous Expense Allowance is intended to cover
these costs.
Tax Liability
This benefit is reported as additional gross earnings and the amount is grossed up to help offset additional taxes.
Final Trip
Reimbursement will be provided for reasonable in-transit expenses incurred by you, your spouse/registered domestic partner, and
eligible dependents while traveling on the final trip from the old to the new location.
Eligible expenses include reasonable travel, such as a shuttle or taxi to the airport, lodging and meal expenses. Meals up to $75 per
day per adults and children aged 16 and older and $40 per day per child under the age of 16. Costs for alcoholic beverages will not
be reimbursed.
You must work with your RMC consultant to make your travel arrangements. Air transportation (coach class with advance purchase)
will be provided if the distance is over 400 miles; otherwise you are required to drive to the new location. Baggage fees for up to two
pieces of regular luggage per person will be eligible for reimbursement. You may be reimbursed for up to $100 in total per person
for baggage fees. Any additional baggage fees should be paid for using your Miscellaneous Allowance.
If you drive, you will be reimbursed mileage for up to two automobiles. Mileage reimbursement will be based on the current IRS
rate for business travel by the most direct route. Other expenses for

hotel and meal reimbursement will be based on travel of at least 400 miles per day. No reimbursement is provided for the additionalcost of side trips or sightseeing.
Expenses are reimbursable for one night prior to departure, en route, and if you are unable to move directly into your new home
upon arrival, one night at the destination.
Do not use your corporate credit cards for relocation expenses. In addition, do not use your company car for activities related to
relocation as the IRS considers such use as taxable income to you.
You must report actual travel expenses on a Relocation Expense Form and submit to the RMC for approval.
Tax Liability
Final trip expenses are reported as additional gross earnings and are grossed up.
Expense Reporting
In some circumstances, you are required to pay certain relocation expenses and request reimbursement afterward. Such
reimbursement requests must be kept separate from other business expenses and submitted to the RMC, using the Relocation
Expense Form.
After submitting the expense report online, the required receipt copies should be submitted to the RMC for approval and processing
no later than 30 days after you incur the expenses.
 Failure to submit expenses within this time frame could jeopardize reimbursement, your tax assistance, or both. Reimbursement will be for actual, reasonable costs only, within the guidelines.
Please remember:
•
You must include copies of itemized  receipts for all expenses in order to be eligible for reimbursement. •
You must include a copy of the expense report when you provide your receipts.•
It is wise to make copies of all reimbursement forms and receipts that you submit for your personal records as well as forincome tax purposes.
•
All expense associated with your relocation must be reimbursed within your 12 month relocation benefit period.Regular business/travel expenses must be submitted separately to PG&E on separate expense reports.
Do not use your corporate credit cards for relocation expenses. In addition, you may not use your company car for activities related
to relocation, as the IRS considers such use as taxable income to you.
In addition to other policy provisions regarding the timing of expense reimbursements, any reimbursements of taxable expenses
provided pursuant to this program shall be reimbursed on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the
expense was incurred, consistent with requirements in Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, as it may be amended.

The amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement is not subject to a multi-year cap.  As a result, expenses eligible forreimbursement during one year do not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year.
Tax Liability on Relocation Expenses
Paid to You or On Your Behalf
Most of the amounts expended by PG&E on your behalf during relocation, whether reimbursed to you or paid directly to the service
provider, will be included in your annual income and will appear on your W-2 issued in January of the following year.
PG&E will provide tax assistance for most taxable benefits through a process called “gross-up.” The RMC will calculate the amount
of gross-up to which you are entitled and report it to PG&E. PG&E, through the payroll department, will pay additional funds
directly to the appropriate tax authority to help offset the tax liability.
Please take note of these important factors pertaining to your gross-up benefits:
•
The tax assistance provided by PG&E will be calculated using supplemental federal, state and local rates and will include SocialSecurity and Medicare if applicable.
•
Certain relocation expenses, which are not grossed up, may be deductible on your individual tax return.•
Gross-up is provided as a financial benefit, but is not intended to compensate you completely for all tax liabilities.•
You are responsible for calculating, reporting and paying all personal federal, state and local income taxes for which you areliable. The RMC will send you a detailed gross-up package that itemizes all relocation expenses for the tax year, including the
gross-up payments the Company provides on your behalf. The package is provided for your information and for use by your tax
professional if you use such services.
The services of tax and legal professionals are recommended.

Settlement in Shares/ 
Performance Goals
As  long  as  you  remain  in  service  with  PG&E  Corporation  (which  includes  service  on  the  PG&E  Corporation  Board  ofDirectors),
 the Performance Shares will vest upon, and to the extent of, the Committee’s certification of the extent to whichperformance
 goals have been attained for this award as of December 31, 2020 (the “Vesting Date”), which certification willoccur
 on or after January 1, 2021 but before March 15, 2021. Except as described below, all Performance Shares that havenot vested will be cancel
led upon termination of your service with PG&E Corporation. Vested
 Performance  Shares  will  be  settled  in  shares  of  PG&E  Corporation  common  stock,  subject  to  the  satisfaction  ofWithholding
 Taxes, as described below. The number of shares you are entitled to receive will be calculated by multiplyingthe
 number of vested Performance Shares by (a) a proration factor reflecting the number of months you worked during 2020and
 (b)  the  “payout  percentage”  determined  as  follows  (except  as  set  forth  elsewhere  in  this  Agreement),  rounded  to  thenearest whole number. 
The
 Performance  Shares have performance  goals consistent with those in the 2020 Short Term Incentive  Plan, and as setforth
 in Exhibit A. The resulting payout percentage will be based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals asmeasured over the period J
anuary 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Achievement
 of  the  Performance  Shares’  performance  goals  will  be  certified  by  the  Committee.  Subject  to  roundingconsiderations,
 if  performance  is  below  threshold,  the  payout  percentage  will  be  0%;  if  performance  is  at  threshold,  thepayout
 percentage will be 50%; if performance is at target, the payout percentage will be 100%; and if performance is at orbetter
 than maximum, the payout percentage will be 200%. The actual payout percentage for performance between thresholdand
 maximum will be determined based on linear interpolation between the payout percentages for threshold and target, ortarget
 and maximum, as appropriate. The final score will be determined in the discretion of the PG&E Corporation Board ofDirectors or its delega
te, including any decision to reduce or forego payment entirely.The
 final payout percentage, if any, will be determined as soon as practicable following the date that the Committee or anequivalent
 body certifies the extent to which the performance goals have been attained, pursuant to Section 10.5(a) of theLTIP.
 PG&E Corporation will issue shares as soon as practicable after such determination, but no earlier than the VestingDate, and not later than Ma
rch 15 of the calendar year following the Vesting Date.

 by the number of Performance Shares granted to you by this Agreement will be accrued on your behalf. If youreceive a
 Performance Share settlement in accordance with the preceding paragraph, at that same time you also will receive acash
 payment equal to the amount of any dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares multiplied by the samepayout percentage used to de
termine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.Voluntary Termination
If  you  terminate  your  employment  with  PG&E  Corporation  voluntarily  before  the  Vesting  Date,  all  of  the  PerformanceShares
 will  be  cancelled  as  of  the  date  of  such  termination  and  any  dividends  accrued  with  respect  to  your  PerformanceShares will be forfeited.

If  your employment with PG&E Corporation is terminated at any time by PG&E Corporation for cause before the VestingDate,
 all  of  the  Performance  Shares  will  be  cancelled  as  of  the  date  of  such  termination  and  any  dividends  accrued  withrespect

If your employment is terminated by PG&E Corporation other than for cause in connection with a Change in Control withintwo
 years following the Change in Control, all of your outstanding Performance Shares (to the extent they did not previouslyvest
 upon  failure  of  the  Acquiror  to  assume  or  continue  this  award)  will  vest  and  become  nonforfeitable  on  the  date  oftermination of your emp
loyment. If
 your employment is terminated by PG&E Corporation other than for cause in connection with a Change in Control withinthree
 months before the Change in Control occurs, all of your outstanding Performance Shares will vest in full and becomenonforfeitable as of th
e date of the Change in Control. Your vested Performance Shares, if any, will be settled as soon as practicable following the original Vesting Date but no later
than
 March 15 of the year following the Vesting Date, based on the payout percentage (which in this case will be deemed tobe
 at target, consistent with the “Change in Control” section, above). At that time you also will receive a cash payment, ifany,
 equal to the amount of dividends accrued from the date of grant through the Vesting Date with respect to your vestedPerformance

 equal to the amount of any Federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by PG&ECorporation
 in  connection  with  the  Performance  Shares  determined  using  the  applicable  minimum  statutory  withholdingrates, including social s
ecurity and Medicare taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the California StateDisability
 Insurance  tax  (“Withholding  Taxes”).  If  the  withheld  shares  were  not  sufficient  to  satisfy  your  minimumWithholding Taxes,
 you will be required to pay, as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, anyamount of the Withholding Tax
es that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares described above. Leaves of Absence
