The Development of Our Company
Although Walmart was incorpor
ated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened afranchise Ben Franklin vari
ety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, ourfounders' business was devoted entir
ely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened inRogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, 
and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Neighborhood Market.In 1991, we began our first intern
ational initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has continued to expandand, as of 
January 31, 2016 , our Walmart Intern ational segment conducted business in 27 countries.In 2000, we began our first digita
l initiative by creating the walmart.com retail website. Since then, our digital presence has continued to grow. As of January 31, 2016 
, we operated e-commer ce websites in 11 countries, providing access to Walmart and our various brands around the world.5

Information About Our SegmentsThe Company is engaged in the opera
tion of retail, wholesale and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America,Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and 
the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., WalmartInternational and Sam's Club. The Comp
any defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularlyreviews to analyze perfo
rmance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical tosegregate and identify 
revenues for each of these individual products and services.Walmart U.S. is our largest s
egment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, aswell as digital reta
il. Walmart U.S. generated approximately 62% of our net sales in fisca l 2016 , and of our three segments, W almart U.S. is the largest and hashistorically had the high
est gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amountto the Company's net sales and oper
ating income.Walmart Interna
tional consists of operations in 27 countries outside of the U.S. and includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail,wholesale and other. These ca
tegories consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs,cash & carry, home impro
vement, specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. Walmart International generatedapproximately 
26% of our fiscal 2016 net sales. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of itsmerchandise mix. Wal
mart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units.Sam's Club consists of membership-on
ly warehouse clubs and operates in 48 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as digital retail. Sam's Club accountedfor approximately 
12% of our fiscal 2016 net sales. As a membership-on ly warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment'soperating income. As a resul
t, Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.The Company measures the resul
ts of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporateoverhead allocations. From 
time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, asdetermined by the infor
mation regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances arereclassified to be co
mparable to the current period's presentation.Walmart U.S. Segment
The Walmart U.S. segment is a 
mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the "Walmart" or "Wal-Mart" brands, as well as walmart.com. TheWalmart U.S. segment had net s
ales of $298.4 billion , $288.0 billion and $279.4 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. During the mos t recentfiscal year, no single uni

chandise and services, both of which vary by country. Digital retail supports our physical stores with capabilities like "Click & Collect" inthe United Kingdom and our grocery hom
e delivery business in Mexico.Merchandise. 
The merchandising strat egy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scopeof merchandise offer
ed for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developedmarket specific pr
ivate brands to serve our customers with high quality, lower priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate,""George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Hom
etrends," "Mainstays," "Ol' Roy" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specificbrands including "Aurrera," "Cambr
idge," "Chosen by You," "Extra Special" and "Smart Price." In addition, we have developed relationships with regional andlocal suppliers in each 
market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.Operations. 
The hours of operation for oper ating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries,depending upon local and nationa
l ordinances governing hours of operation. Each country accepts a variety of payment methods.Seasonal Aspects of Operations. 
The Walmart Intern ational segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volumeand operating income have o
ccurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religiousholidays, festivals and custo
ms, as well as different weather patterns.Competition. 
The Walmart Intern ational segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department,drug, variety and special
ty stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home improvement, specialty electronic, e-commerce and catalog businesses in each of themarkets in which we operate. 
We also operate, on a limited basis, consumer finance operations. We compete with others for desirable sites. Our ability to develop,open and operate units at th
e right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to alarge extent, our competitive
 position in the markets in which Walmart International operates. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business modeland we continue to focus on moving our m
arkets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significantimpact on our competit
ive position in the markets where we operate. In the markets in which we have retail websites or retail websites and mobile commerceapplications, those websites 
and applications help differentiate us from our competitors and help us compete with other retailers for customers and their purchases,both in the digital and the phys
ical retail operations.11

As a retailer and warehouse 
club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the UnitedStates, from whom we purchase the 
merchandise that we sell in our stores and clubs. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near thestores and clubs in which such mer
chandise will be sold, particularly products in the "fresh" category. Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of anumber of our suppliers' annual s
ales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers. Oursuppliers are subject to s
tandards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws.Our ability to acquire f
rom our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the requiredtime through our supply chain and

ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS The risks described below could m
aterially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations couldalso be affected by addi
tional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally.Strategic Risks
General or macro-economi
c factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.General economic condit
ions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower orhigher prices of petrol
eum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housingmarket, inflation, deflation,
 increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumerdisposable income, unavail
ability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currencyexchange rates, higher t
ax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges, other changes in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall economic slowdown andother economic facto
rs could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our business, change the mix of products we sell toone with a lower average gross m
argin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, otherwise adversely affect our net sales and result in slowerinventory turnover and grea
ter markdowns on inventory.Higher levels of unemploymen
t, inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, changes in consumer spendingand shopping patterns, changes in t
ax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchangerates, currency devalu
ations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demandfor our merchandise in thos
e countries, especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than average incomes in the U.S. Theseconditions may adversely a
ffect our net sales, gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations andconsolidated operating r
esults.Higher interest rates, 
lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and otherenergy, higher transporta
tion costs, inflation, higher commodity prices, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, currency exchange rate fluctuations, highertax rates and other chang
es in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated withinternational trad
e, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we have operations can increase ourcost of sales and operating, s
elling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and ouroperating results. The econo
mic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods,a factor that can r
esult in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, could result in certain suppliers notproducing goods in the volume typic
ally available to us for sale.We may not timely identify or e
ffectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, whether involving physical retail, digital retail or the integration ofphysical and digital retail, which could negatively aff
ect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our marketshare.
It is difficult to pr
edict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on howaccurately we predict cons
umer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment,whether for customers purch
asing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital retail businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings. Acritical piece o
f identifying consumer preferences involves price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed and cost ofshipping. These factors are o
f primary importance to customers and they continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social mediaavailable to consumers 
and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products online, at physical locations or through a combination of both retailofferings. Failure to ti
mely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including the key factors described above) and spendingpatterns, whether for 
our physical retail offerings, digital retail offerings or the integration of physical retail and digital retail, could negatively affect ourrelationship with our custom
ers, the demand for our products and services and our market share.17

We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or through the integration ofboth areas), which could materially adversely af
fect our financial performance.The retail business is highly 
competitive. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store and club sites, products and services and in otherimportant aspects of i
ts business with many other local, regional, national and global retailers and wholesale club operators, as well as other national andinternational internet-based retailers
 and retail intermediaries. Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, drug, dollar,variety and specialty s
tores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segmentcompetes with other wholesal
e club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors,gasoline stations, as well as 
e-commerce retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses.Internationally, we compete
 with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores,hypermarkets, wholesale c
lubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, apparel stores, wholesale clubs, cash & carry operations, convenience storesand e-commerce and catalog b
usinesses. We compete with such retailers, wholesale club operators and e-commerce retailers in a variety of ways, including theprices at which we sell our m
erchandise, the merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, theshopping convenience and overal
l shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications,cost and speed of and options for de
livery to our customers of the merchandise they purchase from us online, through mobile commerce applications and theintegration of our physica
l locations with our digital retail operations.Where necessary, to comp
ete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lowerour prices on goods for sale. Our abi
lity to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect ourfinancial perform
ance. See "Item 1. Business" above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in each of our reportable segments.Although the retail industry 
as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which couldresult in increased competitio
n and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improvedfinancial resources, improve
d access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitivepositions. Such business combinations cou
ld result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidatedcompanies, which could adverse
ly affect our financial performance.Consumers are increasingly 
embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, a greater portion of total consumer expenditureswith all retailers 
and wholesale clubs could occur online and through mobile commerce applications. If we fail to maintain or grow our overall market positionthrough the integration of ou
r physical retail presence and digital retail, our net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, a greaterconcentration of ret
ail and wholesale club sales in online and mobile commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic we have in our stores andclubs, which would, in turn, reduce the oppo
rtunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such in-store and in-club traffic creates and couldreduce our sales withi
n our stores and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical side of our segments’ overall operations.Operational Risks
Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-polit
ical events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.The occurrence of one or mo
re natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such asmajor or extended winter s
torms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events,such as civil unrest or te
rrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financialperformance. Such events cou
ld result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs anddistribution facili
ties, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores andclubs directly affe
cted by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailabilityof our retail websites and 
mobile commerce applications to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income,the temporary or long-t
erm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, thedisruption or delay in the de
livery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability ofproducts in our stores, the disrup
tion of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. These events and theirimpacts could otherwise dis
rupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur, such as Superstorm Sandy in the U.S. in2012, or numerous winter storm syste
ms in the U.S. in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and could adversely affect our financial performance.18

In light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropicalstorms, earthquakes, floods and 
tsunamis in the current insurance market, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to beprimarily self-insu
red with respect to such losses. Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amountsto guard against catast
rophic losses suffered from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or thedestruction of, any stores, c
lubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophiclevels of coverage, as wel
l as in the event of a catastrophe, in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Significant losses caused by such events couldmaterially adversely affect our fina
ncial performance.Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could mate
rially adversely affect our financial performance.The products we sell are sourc
ed from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an importantfactor in our financi
al performance. We expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and tootherwise meet our requi
red supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely andefficient manner 
is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.Political and economic 
instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers'failure to meet c
ertain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and theirmanufacturers, the availability 
of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from thesuppliers and manufactur
ers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount ofmerchandise we purchase en
ters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to thesuppliers and the countries 
in which they are located are beyond our control.In addition, the U.S.'s foreign trad
e policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on theimportation of cert
ain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond ourcontrol. These and other fa
ctors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.If the products we sell are not safe or otherwis
e fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries sufferedby our customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise exper
ience material adverse effects to our financial performance.Our customers count on us to provide th
em with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers orthat we prepare and then se
ll could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food andnon-food needs, even if the basis 
for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly toreestablish. As such, any issue reg
arding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financialperformance.
We rely extensively on informat
ion systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary andsecondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.
Although we have independent, redundant 
and physically separate primary and secondary information systems, given the number of individual transactions wehave each year, it is c
ritical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems, including our back-upsystems, are subject to da
mage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computerprograms, denial-of-service attac
ks, security breaches (through cyberattacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such asfires, tornadoes, earthqu
akes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates. If our information systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached orcease to function proper
ly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in theinterim. Any materia
l interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results ofoperations. In addition, we ar
e pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems, which will include, for many of ourinformation systems, est
ablishing common processes across our lines of business. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes areundertaken, although we believ
e that our change management process will mitigate this risk. If we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we mayfail to realize the cost savin
gs anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.19

If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as ourability to grow our e-commerc
e business globally, could be materially adversely affected.Many of our customers shop with us over our 
e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including walmart.com and samsclub.com in the U.S. andour retail websites in 10 oth
er countries, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smartphones to shop online and through mobile 
commerce applications with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly usingsocial media to inte
ract with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our multi-channel sales strategy, we offer "WalmartPickup" and "Club Pickup" and in a growing number of lo
cations, "Online Grocery" programs under which many products available for purchase online can beshipped to and picked up by the custom
er at his or her local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs.Multi-channel reta
iling is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. and in a number of markets in which our WalmartInternational segment operates.
We must anticipate 
and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for new developments and technology investments by our competitors throughfocusing on the building and deliv
ery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provideattractive, user-friendly e-commerce platf
orms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options andthat continually mee
t the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and mobile commerce application merchandising and relatedtechnology could place us at 
a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a materialadverse impact on the growth o
f our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Any failure to maintain the security of the 
information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors that we hold, whether as aresult of cybersecurity atta
cks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, members, associates, vendors andothers, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject 
to litigation, and could materially adversely affect our operating results.As do most retailers, we rec
eive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive andstore personal informa
tion concerning our associates and vendors. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, withoutlimitation, encrypt
ion and authentication technology, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. In addition, our online operations atwww.walmart.com, www.samsclub.com and our websites 
in certain of our foreign markets depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information overpublic networks, including infor
mation permitting cashless payments. Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in ourinformation systems. We 
maintain substantial security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, such information and have security processes,protocols and standards that 
are applicable to our third-party service providers to protect information from our systems to which they have access to under theirengagements with us.
However, we or our third-party serv
ice providers may be unable to anticipate one or more of the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated means by whichcyber-attackers may attempt to defeat
 our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and breach our or our third-party service providers'information systems. During f
iscal 2016, we were notified that a third party service provider that hosts the online photo center for Walmart Canada suffered asecurity breach that 
compromised information of users of that company's site, including some Walmart Canada customers, which we believe has not had a materialimpact on Walmart Can
ada or the Company. Walmart Canada discontinued use of this third party service provider. Sam's Club in the United States also used thesame third party servi
ce provider to host its online photo center through a different system than the one used by Walmart Canada. After the breach in Canada,Sam's Club suspended the operation of th
e online photo center until a security review could be completed by the third party service provider. Once the securityreview was complete and new te
chnology with enhanced security measures was implemented by the third party service provider, along with a determination thatthe information of Sam's Club m
embers was not compromised by the security breach, Sam's Club resumed the operation of the online photo center through thesame third party servi
ce provider.Cyber threats are rapid
ly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. As cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfullydefend against, one or more 
cyber threats might defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers in the future like the incident referencedabove and obtain the personal 
information of customers, members, associates and vendors that we hold or to which our third-party service providers have access,and we or our third-party serv
ice providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breachoccurs. Moreover, as
sociate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third-party serviceproviders' security measu
res and breach our or our third-party service providers' information systems (whether digital or otherwise).20

Any breach of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, which could be undetected for a periodof time, or any failur
e by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect anycustomers and members whose pe
rsonal data was compromised and to restore customer and member confidence in us and to make changes to our informationsystems and administrat
ive processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.In addition, such events could m
aterially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, as well as ouroperations, results of oper
ations, financial condition and liquidity, could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations andfinancial condition and p
erformance and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered byour insurance policies. Mor
eover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the securitybreach and to expend signifi
cant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information againstcyberattacks and other 
attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital retail operations.We accept payments using 
a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label cards and gift cards, and we may offer newpayment options over time, whi
ch may have information security risk implications. By accepting debit and credit cards as a retailer for payment, we are subject tothe Payment Card Industry Data Secu
rity Standard ("PCI DSS"), issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. PCI DSS contains complianceguidelines and standards with r
egard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. Thepayment card industry set Oc
tober 1, 2015 as the date on which it will shift liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept Europay,MasterCard, Visa (EMV) chip card 
credit and debit transactions. While we already accept many EMV cards, if we are unable to fully implement EMV as planned,we may incur increased cos
ts associated with the liability shift. By accepting debit cards for payment, we are also subject to compliance with the AmericanNational Standards Institut
e encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines. Even though we comply with these guidelines and standardsand other information se
curity measures, we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are ableto prevent, contain or det
ect any cyberattacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future. To theextent that any disrupti
on results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers,financial institut
ions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information securitylaws and standards could be signif
icant to us.Our failure to attract and reta
in qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materiallyadversely affect our financial per
formance.Our ability to continue to condu
ct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associatesglobally. Our ability to me
et our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs anddistribution centers, whil
e controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of asufficient number of qua
lified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates,changing demographics, heal
th and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, toattract or to retain qualified per
sonnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.The wage increases for over 500,000 
associates in our operations in the U.S. and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the U.S. that we announced inFebruary 2015, and related wage in
creases for 1.2 million associates aggregating $1.5 billion in the year ending January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017") will increase ourwage and other labor expenses sign
ificantly. If we cannot offset the increases in our wage expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our grossprofit, achieving decr
eases in our operating, selling, general and administrative expense or a combination of both in the year ending January 31, 2018 andthereafter, our consol
idated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could continue to be less than our consolidated operatingincome and consolidated in
come from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal 2017. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase evenmore significantly fo
r other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase ourlabor costs, our fina
ncial performance could be materially adversely affected.21

We may face impediments to our expansion of physical retail in the U.S., which may materially adversely affect our financial performance.Our expansion strategy in the U.S. depends upon our 
ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the U.S. and upon our ability toincrease the number of s
tores in markets in which we currently have operations. Our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, NeighborhoodMarkets, other store for
mats, and Sam's Clubs depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store siteson acceptable terms. Lo
cal real estate, land use, zoning, and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our variousformats, as well as loca
l community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting ouroperations, may affec
t our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain citiesand states, including in ma
rket areas in which we have no existing operations.Increased real est
ate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters.Moreover, our expansion in our exis
ting local market areas may be limited if the opening of new stores or clubs would result in an unacceptable level ofcannibalization of th
e sales of existing stores or clubs. If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other small formats orSam's Clubs or continue to convert dis
count stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be materiallyadversely affected. 
In addition, if consumers in the markets into which we expand or in which we build stores of a new format are not receptive to our retailconcepts or are otherwi
se not receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be adversely affected.Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart International ope
rations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.Our business strategy for our Wa
lmart International segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets toour existing Walmart 
International business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations. In the countries in which we haveexisting operations, new units m
ay be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such assupercenters or Sam's Clubs, not prev
iously operated in those markets. As in the U.S., our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in amarket served by our Walmart
 International segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability toacquire new store sites on a
cceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which tobuild new units or to expand existing un
its. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expandproduct selections in exis
ting units in certain markets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods.Moreover, cultural dif
ferences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those marketsnot being as receptive to ou
r retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve.Economic, business and legal env
ironments in foreign markets may be such that we are unable to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those marketsas we may want to do and could result 
in the closure of our existing units in such markets, which closures impede the growth of our international operations.Finally, some countries have 
foreign investment laws that prohibit us or limit us from holding a controlling interest in retail operations in those countries, makingour entry into those marke
ts, which may present attractive growth opportunities, more difficult, if not impossible. If we cannot effectively continue to expand ourWalmart Interna
tional segment, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected.We may be unable to continu
e to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any suchcandidate identifi
ed. Although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, nocertainty exists tha
t future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time. Ourfailure to identify appropriate
 candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations couldadversely affect the growt
h of our Walmart International segment and our future financial performance.Financial Risks
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may mat
erially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.Our operations in countries oth
er than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements aredenominated in U.S. dollars, and to pr
epare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expensesof our operations outside of th
e U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currencyexchange rates that wer
e unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of22

operations. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in ourconsolidated financial statement
s reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-periodimprovement in our finan
cial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currencyexchange rate fluctuations 
will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effecton our reported consolidated 
results of operations.We may pay for products we purch
ase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which thegoods will be sold. When we must acquir
e the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorableto us, our cost of sales may inc
rease and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, witha corresponding adverse ef
fect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.Failure to meet market expe
ctations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.We believe that the price of 
our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting theseexpectations, including our 
comparable store and club sales growth rates, e-commerce growth rates, gross margin, earnings and earnings per share or new store andclub openings could cause the m
arket price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies.Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our operations subject us to risks associated with the leg
islative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific tothe countries or regions in which we operate, which could mater
ially adversely affect our business or financial performance.We are currently eng
aged in the operation of retail through our wholly-owned subsidiaries operating in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan andthe United Kingdom; our majori
ty-owned subsidiaries operating in Africa, Central America and Mexico; and our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries inChina in addition to our U.S. operations. During 
fiscal 2016 , our Walmart Intern ational operations generated approximately 26% of our consolidated net sal es. Ourdivisions also source goods and servi
ces from other countries. The future expansion of our operations in countries outside the U.S. could result in our internationaloperations accounting for 
a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughoutthe world could be negatively 
affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including politicalinstability, local and g
lobal economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws,anti-money laundering l
aws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now orin the future.
In particular, Brazi
lian federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes it complies with those laws,the Company's subsidiaries in Braz
il are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course ofbusiness in Brazil.
 These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could materially adversely affect our financialperformance.
Moreover, the economies of so
me of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations,which, if they occurred aga
in, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade,monetary and fiscal pol
icies both of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similarorganizations, and risks assoc
iated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risksinherent in our interna
tional operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequencesand greater difficu
lty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally alsoexist when doing business outside of the U.S., and m
ay be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences inculture, laws and regulat
ions.In foreign countries in which we h
ave operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in businesspractices prohibited by U.S. laws and 
regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the laws and regulations of other countries such asthe UK Bribery Act. We maintain po
licies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption compliance programs designed toensure compliance with th
ese laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, includingthose based in or from countr
ies where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, willengage in business practic
es that are prohibited by our23

policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies,could adversely affec
t our business or financial performance and our reputation.We are also subject to 
income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. Thedetermination of our worldwid
e provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxescould be materially 
adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated injurisdictions that have h
igher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, oraccounting principles.
We are subject to regu
lar review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changingtax regulations and legi
slation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amountsrecorded in our consolidat
ed financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for whichsuch determination and se
ttlement is made.We are subject to certain lega
l proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We are involved in a numbe
r of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in anumber of cases containing 
class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number ofcases containing class-
action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Comp
any, has been named as a defendant in over 7,000 "equal value" claims that arepending in the Manchester Emp
loyment Tribunal (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former ASDA storeemployees, allege tha
t the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of theirjobs to that of male emp
loyees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is notobjectively justifi
ed. The claimants are seeking: (i) back pay consisting of the difference between the wage rate paid in the stores and the rate paid in thewarehouses and distribution fa
cilities for the period of their employment up to a maximum of six years under the statute of limitations; and (ii) an increase in thestore rate prospectiv
ely, to match that paid in the warehouses and the distribution facilities. On January 30, 2015, the Employment Tribunal held a casemanagement conferen
ce in order to set a schedule for addressing jurisdictional challenges and other issues involved in the first phase of the litigation. At this time,it is undetermined: (i) ho
w many of these claims may ultimately be filed; or (ii) whether the Employment Tribunal will decide to hear each claim individually or toconsolidate them into groups o
f similar claims and proceed with the trial of "test cases." Determinations made in such test cases, if any, might be asserted asbinding in subsequent trials of 
claims within that group and any subsequent claims involving the same issues. Moreover, a determination as to the appropriate rateof pay for a particula
r store position might be asserted as the basis for additional claims for back pay or wage increases by other store associates who perform, orwho have performed, like work in th
at position.On March 23, 2015, ASDA asked the Employment Tribunal to s
tay all proceedings, contending that the High Court, which is the superior first instance civil courtin the UK that is headquarter
ed in the Royal Courts of Justice in the City of London, is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these claims. On March23, 2015, ASDA also asked the Employment Tribunal to "s
trike out" substantially all of the claims for failing to comply with Employment Tribunal rules.Following argument and appella
te proceedings, the claims have remained in the Employment Tribunal. The issue of stay, strike out, and the scope of EmploymentTribunal rules are the sub
ject of further appellate proceedings. We discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption "Item 3.Legal Proceedings" and in Note 10 in th
e "Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements," which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which areincorporated by refer
ence in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.24

We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter.The Audit Committee of our Board of Di
rectors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is conducting an internal investigation into, among otherthings, alleged violations o
f the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreignsubsidiaries, including Wa
l-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V., or Walmex, and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations and/ormisconduct. We are also 
conducting a voluntary global review of our policies, practices and internal controls for FCPA compliance and strengthening our globalanti-corruption compliance pr
ograms. Since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee andwe have identified or been 
made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations ofpotential FCPA violations have been co
mmenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. InNovember 2011, we voluntarily disclos
ed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the SEC, and we have been informed by theDOJ and the SEC that we are the subject of 
their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA. A number of federal and local governmentagencies in Mexico have a
lso initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by severalof our shareholders against us, 
certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers.We could be exposed to a vari
ety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of thematters that are 
the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines,penalties, injunctions, c
ease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The existing and any additional shareholder lawsuitsmay result in judgments ag
ainst us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We cannot predict at this time the outcome orimpact of the governmen
t investigations, the shareholder lawsuits, or our own internal investigations and review. Moreover, we expect to continue to incur costs(incremental to th
e $126 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2016 and the costs incurred in prior years) in conducting our on-going review and investigations and inresponding to requests for info
rmation or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and indefending the existing and any 
additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or formerofficers. These matters may re
quire the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote toother matters rel
ating to our business. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from mediapublications on these mat
ters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences. Our process of assessing and respondingto the governmental inves
tigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues. While we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters, giventhe on-going nature and compl
exity of the review, inquiries and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from thesematters. Although we do not present
ly believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in suchsituations, we can provide no assur
ance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future.ITEM 1B.

ITEM 3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: 
We discuss certain leg al proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, entitled "Contingencies,"which is one of the Notes to Consolidated Fin
ancial Statements incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporat

is for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legalproceedings, including the na
me of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.Wage-and-Hour

Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others-M anchester Employment Tribunal).II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: 
The Company is a defendant in seve ral lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in anews story that appeared in 
The New York Times ( the " Times " ) on April 21, 2012. One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in theUnited States District Court fo
r the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff allegesvarious violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrup
t Practices Act (the "FCPA") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, as amended, re
lating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased oracquired stock of the Company be
tween December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants'conduct affected the v
alue of such stock. In addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the allegations ofthe 
Times story, and naming various curr ent and former officers and directors as additional defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Companyis a nominal defendant) 
allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties inconnection with oversight of FCPA complian
ce. All of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which was consolidatedin the United States Distric
t Court for the Western District of Arkansas and the other in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On March 31, 2015, the Western Districtof Arkansas granted the defend
ants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. On April 15, 2015, plaintiffs filed their notice ofappeal with the United States Cour
t of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may beincurred in connection with 
these proceedings will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.Securities Class Action:

III.  ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS: Item  103  of  SEC  Regulation  S-K  requires  disclosure  of  certain  environmental  matters.  The  following  matters  aredisclosed
 in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss thatmay be incurred in connec
tion with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.During fiscal year 2015, a Cali
fornia Greenwashing Task Force informed the Company (including one of its subsidiaries) that it was investigating whether theCompany and its subsidiary had viola
ted a California statute that prohibits the sale of plastic products labeled by the Company's and its subsidiary's suppliers as"biodegradable" or "compostab
le." On January 13, 2016, the Task Force sent the Company and its subsidiary a settlement demand with the following terms: a $1.5million civil penal
ty; a restitution program; a compliance program; and investigative costs. On March 7, 2016, the Company and its subsidiary responded to theoffer and are continuing 
to work with the Task Force towards a resolution.On April 23, 2015, Wal-Mart Transport
ation LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, received a Finding and Notice of Violation from the Environmental ProtectionAgency alleging that Wal
mart Transportation violated the California Air Resources Board's Truck and Bus regulations by failing to install particulate matter filterson some diesel fuelled veh
icles. The Company is responding to the allegations and is cooperating with the agency.On April 6, 2015, representatives fo
r the Brazilian Institute of the Environment alleged that WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda ("Walmart Brazil") had failed tofile required repor
ts documenting the number of tires imported, sold and recycled. The agency proposed a penalty of approximately $857,000 and prohibitedWalmart Brazil f
rom selling or importing tires until the matter is resolved. In October 2015, Walmart Brazil filed its defense with the agency against the impositionof this penalty.
In September 2014, a spill of app
roximately 50 liters of fuel occurred at a store in Lerma, Mexico. A subsidiary of the Company, Nueva Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.de R.L. de C.V., took steps to address the spill and 
engaged an expert to oversee the final cleanup. The Municipality of Lerma proposed a penalty of approximately$128,000 along with the implement
ation of a monitoring program around the spill area to address the situation. The Company implemented a monitoring programwhich concluded that there was no 
contamination in the spill area and is challenging the penalty in an administrative court.In February 2014, a division of the Hea
lth Department of the City of Vitória notified Walmart Brazil, a subsidiary of the Company, that a wastewater leak had beenobserved in the parking lot of 
a store. Walmart Brazil has been cooperating with the agency and believes that it has addressed the situation.In January 2014, a division of the Sta
te Department of Sustainable Development of Santa Catarina notified Walmart Brazil that a store did not have the properlicense for a wastewate
r treatment system. Walmart Brazil resolved the matter by paying a penalty of approximately $50,000 and is awaiting the issuance of thelicense.
In August 2013, the Company received a not
ice from the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") alleging that two products sold by the Company haveexceeded volatile org
anic chemical limits prescribed in its California Consumer Products Regulations. The Company is responding to the allegations andcooperating with CARB's investigation.
In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corpo
racion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality ofCurridabat is seeking a pena
lty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall seventeen years ago for a perishables distributioncenter that is situated alon
g a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at thetime of construction, but 
the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming.In April and May 2011, the Environment
al and Natural History Ministry of Chiapas, Mexico ("Ministry") notified a subsidiary of the Company, Arrendadora deCentros Comerciales, S. de R.L. de C.V. ("Arrendador
a"), that five stores may have been constructed without first obtaining an environmental impact license asrequired, and for fail
ing to comply with conditions required by those licenses. The Ministry proposed a penalty of approximately $178,000 related to such storesand Arrendadora is current
ly in discussions with the Ministry regarding payment of such amount. In 2014, the Ministry informed Arrendadora it believed that fouradditional stores may hav
e been constructed with the same deficiencies. The Ministry proposed a penalty of approximately $640,000 in respect to such additionalstores and also required Arr
endadora to obtain the licenses and comply with the required conditions. Arrendadora was subsequently released by an administrativecourt from the payment o
f such penalty. Arrendadora is in compliance with the conditions required for the licenses of all the foregoing stores.In January 2011, the Environmenta
l Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified Walmart Brazil of soil inspection reports indicating soilcontamination due to le
akage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil. Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency as well as theDistrict Attorney's Office 
for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation.ITEM 4.

ITEM 9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosur
e controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, isaccumulated and commun
icated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls andprocedures, no matter how well d
esigned and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management isnecessarily required 
to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control ormanage those entities, ou
r controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to ourconsolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of busin
ess, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controlsand increase efficiency, w
hile ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new,more efficient syst
ems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasingmonitoring controls. 
These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financialreporting. However, they allow us to con
tinue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remainseffective.
An evaluation of the effe
ctiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report wasperformed under the superv
ision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon thatevaluation, our Chief Execut
ive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonableassurance that inform
ation required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, isaccumulated and commun
icated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisionsregarding required disc
losure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within thetime periods specifi
ed by the SEC's rules and forms.Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management's report on int
ernal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered publicaccounting firm, on the Company's 
internal control over financial reporting are incorporated herein by reference to all information under the captions"Management's Report to Our Sharehold
ers" and "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,"respectively, included 
in our Annual Report to Shareholders. Such information is included in Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the second quarter of f
iscal 2016, we identified and disclosed a material weakness in our controls over accounting for leases. The material weakness ininternal control over financial
 reporting resulted from a lack of controls which allowed for the misinterpretation and historical misapplication of AccountingStandards Codification 840, 
Leases ("ASC 840") regarding sale-leaseb ack accounting, primarily lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets.Specifically, we did not have 
adequate controls in place to properly identify and account for leases that were subject to the sale-leaseback accounting guidance,primarily leases in whi
ch we made payments for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets, which should have resultedin the Company being deemed the owne
r of the leased assets for accounting purposes. To remediate the material weakness described above, we designed andimplemented controls 
and enhanced and revised the design of existing controls and procedures to properly apply sale-leaseback accounting, primarily lesseeinvolvement in the constru
ction of leased assets, under ASC 840.During the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2016, we successfully completed the testing necessary to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated.Except as noted above, there h
as been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 , that has material ly affected, oris reasonably likely to
 materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.ITEM 9B.

instructions timely delivered to the Account Administrator. In the event that a Participant does not timely provide the Account

Account to the extent such action or direction would comply with applicable law and any applicable listing standards of a national
stock exchange.

 Deferred  Compensation,  Deferred  MIP Bonus  and  Deferred  Special  Bonus.  Any  payments received  hereunder  by  aParticipant

You  will not receive, or be entitled to receive, cash or any non-cash dividends on the Performance Units or theShares underlying the Performance Units; and

5. 
Vesting of the Performance Units and Delivery of Shares . A. 
Incentive  Years  and  Achievement  Rates .  The  Committee  establishes  the  Performance  Goals  and  PerformanceMeasures
 applicable  to  your  Performance  Units.  You  will  be  informed  of  the  performance  criteria  applicable  to  yourPerformance
 Units in respect of each fiscal year of Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you (the "Employer")during
 the Performance Period. Each such fiscal year during the Performance Period is referred to in this Agreement as an“Incentive
 Year.” The Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof) and Performance Goals as setforth in such separate writing are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
The
 number of Performance Units that ultimately may vest and, accordingly, the Shares that may be delivered to you shalldepend upon
 the degree to which the Performance Goals have been achieved, as determined by the Committee in accordancewith
 the Plan, for each Performance Measure during each Incentive Year of the Performance Period. With respect to eachapplicable Performance Measure during an Incentive Year:
1. 
“Threshold”  performance means the achievement of the lowest possible Performance Goal established bythe Committee;
2. 
“Target” performance means the achievement of the Performance Goal established by the Committee; and 3. 
“Maximum”  performance means the highest possible achievement of the Performance Goal established bythe Committee.
An achievement rate
 is determined for each Performance Measure applicable to your Plan Award in respect of each IncentiveYear
 of  the  Performance  Period.  The  achievement  rate  value  applied  to  each  weighted  Performance  Measure  during  anIncentive Year is
2

expressed as a percentage and may range from 0% (for achieving less than Threshold Performance), 50% (for achieving atleast,
 but  no  less  than,  Threshold  performance),  100%  (for  achieving  Target  performance),  or  up  to  150%  (for  achievingMaximum
 performance).  A  percentage  of  0%  shall  be  applied  to  a  Performance  Measure  during  an  Incentive  Year  ifThreshold performan
ce is not achieved. The weighted average of all applicable achievement rates during an Incentive Year isreferred to as the “Incentive Year Achievement Rate.”
At
 the  end  of  the  Performance  Period,  the  number  of  Performance  Units  that  ultimately  vest  (the  “Vested  PerformanceUnits”)
 is  determined  by multiplying :  (x)  the  average  of  all  Incentive  Year  Achievement  Rates  during  the  PerformancePeriod 
and (y) the number of Performance Units granted by this Agreement.In
 some  instances,  and  as  set  forth  more  specifically  in  the  summary  table  at  the  beginning  of  this  Agreement,  yourPerformance Units may be subject to a Performance Period of less than three years.
1. 
If  your  Performance  Units  are  subject  to  a  two-year  Performance  Period,  then  the  number  of  VestedPerformance Units is determined by 
multiplying : (x)  the average of the Incentive Year Achievement Rates during thetwo-year Performance Period 
and (y) the number of Performance Units granted.2. 
If  your  Performance  Units  are  subject  to  a  one-year  Performance  Period,  then  the  number  of  VestedPerformance Units shall be calculated as the 
lesser of : a)
    the Incentive Year Achievement Rate for the one-year Performance Period multiplied  by the  number ofPerformance Units granted; and
b)
    one  hundred  and  ten  percent  (110%)  of  the  result  of multiplying :  (x)  the  three  year  average  of  theIncentive
 Year Achievement Rate for the one-year Performance Period and the incentive achievement ratesfor
 the  two  fiscal  years  immediately  preceding  the  one-year  Performance  Period and (y)  the  number  ofPerformance Units granted.
B. 
Delivery  of Shares .  Upon the vesting of your Plan Award, you shall be entitled to receive a number of Sharesequal
 to the number of Vested Performance Units as calculated in Paragraph 5.A. above less any Shares withheld or sold tosatisfy
 tax  withholding  obligations  as  set  forth  in  Paragraph  10  below.  The  Shares  shall  be  delivered  to  you  as  soon  asadministratively feasible, but in any event:
1.    within 150 days of the Vesting Date; or
2.    within 74 days of an Accelerated Vesting pursuant to Paragraph 8 below.
Such Shares
 will be deposited into an account in your name with a broker or other third party designated by Walmart.You will be responsible for all fees imposed by such designated broker or other third party designated by Walmart.
C. 
Mandatory  Deferral. If  Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of any Shares in any year would, whenconsidered with your other compensation, result in Walmart’s
3

inability  to  deduct  the  value  of  such  Shares  because  of  the  limitation  on  deductible  compensation  under  Code  Section162(m), then Walmart
 shall defer the delivery of such Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates thatthe
 related  deduction  will  not  be  limited  under  Section  162(m)  (the  “First  Non-162(m)  Year”)  in  accordance  with  theDeferral
 Procedures under the Plan and Code Section 409A and the regulations thereunder. However, if you have made anirrevocable
 election to defer such Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m) Year, then Walmart shall not deliver suchShares
 in the First Non-162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your Shares in accordance with your irrevocable election andthe Deferral Procedures.
1. 
Covered  Employee  Plan  Awards  Subject  to  Shareholder  Approval. To  the  extent  you  are  a  “coveredemployee”
 within  the  meaning  of  Code  Section  162(m),  your  Plan  Award  and  this  Agreement  are  subject  to,  andconditioned
 upon, shareholder approval of the material terms of the performance goals referred to in Paragraph 5.Aabove.
D. 
Elective  Deferral of Shares. If  you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares underlying your Restricted Stockaward

 number  of  Shares  that  would  have  become  vested  under  Paragraph  5.A  had  your  Continuous  Status  as  an  Associatecontinued
 through the Vesting Date described in Paragraph  5.A, prorated based upon the number of full calendar monthsduring

9.
Permanent Transfers Between Walmart and Walmart Affiliates . A. 
Permanent  Transfers  and  Continuous  Status .  For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  a  permanent  transfer  of  ContinuousStatus from Walmart, or the
 Employer (if different), to another Affiliate or from an Affiliate to Walmart does not constitute atermination of your Continuous Status.
B. 
Applicable Performance Measures and Goals Upon Permanent Transfer . 1.

 during the Performance Period, then the Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof)and
 Performance  Goals for the Incentive  Year in which you transferred  Continuous  Status will be prorated  and/oradjusted to reflect
 the proportion of the Incentive Year during which you provided service to Walmart, or, if different,the Affiliate that initially employed you (the “Initial
5

Employer”) and the proportion of the Incentive Year during which you provided service to Walmart or, if different,the Affiliate to which you permanently transferred (the “Subsequent Employer”).
2. 
Incentive  Years Following Permanent Transfer .  Once you permanently transfer your Continuous Status,the
 Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof) and Performance Goals applicable for theSubsequent
 Employer shall be applied to your Performance Units for the subsequent Incentive Years remaining inyour Performance Period.

 transfer your Continuous Status to an Affiliate or into a position where performance-based Plan Awards are notgranted
 (other  than  where  Paragraph  6.B  applies),  then  the  Performance  Measures  (including  any  applicable  weightingsthereof)
 and Performance Goals applicable to your Performance Units will be prorated and adjusted in the same method asset
 forth in Paragraph 9.B.1. and 9.B.2. above; provided  however ,  that for the purposes of Paragraph 9.B.2., you will beinformed of the applicable performance criteria in respect of the subsequent Incentive Years in your Performance Period.
D. 
Transfers  to New Position with Same Employer .  If you transfer to a position with the same Employer (as definedherein)
 but your new position is subject to different applicable Performance Measures (including any applicable weightingsthereof)
 and  Performance  Goals,  then  the  Performance  Measures  (including  any  applicable  weightings  thereof)  andPerformance
 Goals applicable to your Performance Units for the remainder of the Performance Period will be prorated andadjusted using the same methodology as described in Paragraphs 9.B.1. and 9.B.2. above.
10. 
Taxes and Tax Withholding . A. 
You  agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your Performance Units andacknowledge that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice.
B. 
You  acknowledge  that,  regardless  of  any  action  taken  by  Walmart  (or  if  different,  the  Employer),  the  ultimateliability
 for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-relateditems
 related  to  your  participation  in  the  Plan  and  legally  applicable  to  you  (“Tax-Related  Items”)  is  and  remains  yourresponsibility
 and  may  exceed  the  amount  actually  withheld  by  Walmart  or  the  Employer.  You  further  acknowledge  thatWalmart
 and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Itemsin
 connection with any aspect of the Performance Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of thePerformance
 Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends; and(b)
 do  not  commit  to  and  are  under  no  obligation  to  structure  the  terms  of  the  Performance  Units  or  any  aspect  of  thePerformance
 Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, ifyou
 are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (oryour
 former  employer,  as  applicable)  may  be  required  to  withhold  or  account  for  Tax-Related  Items  in  more  than  onejurisdiction.
6

C. Prior  to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangementssatisfactory
 to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart and/or theEmployer,
 or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related
 Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the Vested Performance Units. In the event that suchwithholding
 in  Shares  is  problematic  under  applicable  tax  or  securities  law  or  has  materially  adverse  accountingconsequences,
 by your acceptance of the Performance Units and this Agreement, you authorize and direct Walmart and anybroker
 or  other  third  party  designated  by  Walmart  to  sell  on your  behalf  a  whole  number  of  Shares  corresponding  to theVested Performance
 Units that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient tosatisfy the obligation for Tax-Related
 Items. However, Walmart may also require you to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by anyother method of withholding it authorizes, in its sole discretion, including through withholding from your wages or other cash
compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D. 
Depending  on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Itemsby
 considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximumapplicable
 rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, youare
 deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Vested Performance Units, notwithstanding that anumber of the Shares are withheld solely for the purpo
se of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding wholeShares,
 an excess amount of tax is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities orregulatory
 body. In the event that any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you maybe
 entitled to receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Shareequivalent.
E. 
Finally,  you  agree  to  pay  to  Walmart  or  the  Employer  any  amount  of  Tax-Related  Items  that  Walmart  or  theEmployer
 may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied bythe
 means previously described. Walmart may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, ifyou fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
11. 
Performance  Units Not Transferable .  The Performance Units may not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledgedor
 otherwise disposed of or encumbered at any time prior to vesting of the Performance Units and the issuance of the underlyingShares. Any attempted action in violation of this Paragraph 11 shall be null, void, and without effect.

Vesting of the Performance Units and Delivery of Shares . A. 
Incentive  Years  and  Achievement  Rates .  The  Committee  establishes  the  Performance  Goals  and  PerformanceMeasures
 applicable  to  your  Performance  Units.  You  will  be  informed  of  the  performance  criteria  applicable  to  yourPerformance
 Units in respect of each fiscal year of Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you (the "Employer")during
 the Performance Period. Each such fiscal year during the Performance Period is referred to in this Agreement as an“Incentive
 Year.” The Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof) and Performance Goals as setforth in such separate writing are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
The
 number of Performance Units that ultimately may vest and, accordingly, the Shares that may be delivered to you shalldepend upon
 the degree to which the Performance Goals have been achieved, as determined by the Committee in accordancewith
 the Plan, for each Performance Measure during each Incentive Year of the Performance Period. With respect to eachapplicable Performance Measure during an Incentive Year:

“Threshold”  performance  means  the  achievement  of  the  lowest  possible  Performance  Goal  established  by  theCommittee;
2. 
“Target” performance means the achievement of the Performance Goal established by the Committee; and 3. 
“Maximum”  performance  means  the  highest  possible  achievement  of  the  Performance  Goal  established  by  theCommittee.
An achievement rate
 is determined for each Performance Measure applicable to your Plan Award in respect of each IncentiveYear
 of  the  Performance  Period.  The  achievement  rate  value  applied  to  each  weighted  Performance  Measure  during  anIncentive Year is
2

expressed as a percentage and may range from 0% (for achieving less than Threshold Performance), 50% (for achieving atleast,
 but  no  less  than,  Threshold  performance),  100%  (for  achieving  Target  performance),  or  up  to  150%  (for  achievingMaximum
 performance).  A  percentage  of  0%  shall  be  applied  to  a  Performance  Measure  during  an  Incentive  Year  ifThreshold performan
ce is not achieved. The weighted average of all applicable achievement rates during an Incentive Year isreferred to as the “Incentive Year Achievement Rate.”
At
 the  end  of  the  Performance  Period,  the  number  of  Performance  Units  that  ultimately  vest  (the  “Vested  PerformanceUnits”)
 is  determined  by multiplying :  (x)  the  average  of  all  Incentive  Year  Achievement  Rates  during  the  PerformancePeriod 
and (y) the number of Performance Units granted by this Agreement.In
 some  instances,  and  as  set  forth  more  specifically  in  the  summary  table  at  the  beginning  of  this  Agreement,  yourPerformance Units may be subject to a Performance Period of less than three years.
1. 
If  your Performance Units are subject to a two-year Performance Period, then the number of Vested PerformanceUnits
 is  determined  by multiplying :  (x)  the  average  of  the  Incentive  Year  Achievement  Rates  during  the  two-yearPerformance Period 
and (y) the number of Performance Units granted.2. 
If  your Performance Units are subject to a one-year Performance Period, then the number of Vested PerformanceUnits shall be calculated as the 
lesser of : a)
    the Incentive Year Achievement Rate for the one-year Performance Period multiplied  by the  number ofPerformance Units granted; and
b)
    one  hundred  and  ten  percent  (110%)  of  the  result  of multiplying :  (x)  the  three  year  average  of  theIncentive
 Year Achievement Rate for the one-year Performance Period and the incentive achievement ratesfor
 the  two  fiscal  years  immediately  preceding  the  one-year  Performance  Period and (y)  the  number  ofPerformance Units granted.
B. 
Delivery  of Shares .  Upon the vesting of your Plan Award, you shall be entitled to receive a number of Sharesequal
 to the number of Vested Performance Units as calculated in Paragraph 5.A. above less any Shares withheld or sold tosatisfy
 tax  withholding  obligations  as  set  forth  in  Paragraph  10  below.  The  Shares  shall  be  delivered  to  you  as  soon  asadministratively feasible, but in any event:
1.    within 150 days of the Vesting Date; or

 an independent broker who will in turn purchase the Shares on the open market on your behalf. Any Shares so purchasedon the open market shall be delivered to you as set forth in this Paragraph 5.

Mandatory  Deferral .  If Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of any Shares in any year would, whenconsidered
 with your other compensation,  result in Walmart’s inability  to deduct the value of such Shares because of thelimitation on deductible compensation under 
Code Section 162(m), then Walmart shall defer the delivery of such Shares untilthe
 first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the related deduction will not be limited under Section 162(m)(the
 “First Non-162(m) Year”) in accordance with the Deferral Procedures under the Plan and Code Section 409A and theregulations

 Shares  will  be  delivered  to  you  as  soon  as  administratively  feasible,  but  in  any  event  within  74  days  of  the  end  of  theadministrative suspension period which shall be considered the Vesting Date for purposes of this Paragraph 7.
8. 
Accelerated  Vesting;  Vesting  Notwithstanding  Termination  of  Continuous  Status  by  Death  or  Disability .  YourPerformance
 Units will vest earlier than described in Paragraph 5.A. above, and such earlier vesting date shall also be considered aVesting Date under the following circumstances:
A. 
If your  Continuous Status is terminated by your Disability, you will become vested in a number of Shares equal tothe
 number  of  Shares  that  would  have  become  vested  under  Paragraph  5.A  had  your  Continuous  Status  as  an  Associatecontinued
 through the Vesting Date described in Paragraph  5.A, prorated based upon the number of full calendar monthsduring
 the Performance Period in which you had Continuous Status. “Disability” for the purpose of this Agreement means,unless
 provided otherwise by a policy of Walmart, a physical or mental condition resulting from bodily injury, disease ormental

 Date described in Paragraph 5.A, prorated based upon the number of full calendar months during the PerformancePeriod (as shown above) in which you had Continuous Status.
In
 the event of accelerated vesting under this Paragraph 8, the vested Shares, as determined above, shall be delivered as soonas administratively feasible
 after the later of the Vesting Date or the Committee’s determination of whether, and the extent to which,the performance goals described in Paragraph 5.A have been satisfied.
9. 
Permanent Transfers Between Walmart and Walmart Affiliates . A. 
Permanent  Transfers  and  Continuous  Status .  For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  a  permanent  transfer  of  ContinuousStatus from Walmart, or the
 Employer (if different), to another Affiliate or from an Affiliate to Walmart does not constitute atermination of your Continuous Status.

B. Applicable Performance Measures and Goals Upon Permanent Transfer . 1. 
Incentive  Year Prorated when Permanent  Transfer  Occurs .  If you permanently  transfer your Continuous  Statusduring
 the  Performance  Period,  then  the  Performance  Measures  (including  any  applicable  weightings  thereof)  andPerformance
 Goals for the Incentive Year in which you transferred Continuous Status will be prorated and/or adjusted toreflect
 the proportion of the Incentive Year during which you provided service to Walmart, or, if different, the Affiliatethat
 initially employed you (the “Initial Employer”) and the proportion of the Incentive Year during which you providedservice to Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate to which you permanently transferred (the “Subsequent Employer”).
2. 
Incentive  Years  Following  Permanent  Transfer .  Once  you  permanently  transfer  your  Continuous  Status,  thePerformance
 Measures  (including  any  applicable  weightings  thereof)  and  Performance  Goals  applicable  for  theSubsequent
 Employer shall be applied to your Performance Units for the subsequent Incentive Years remaining in yourPerformance Period.
C. 
Permanent  Transfers  to  Affiliate  or  Position  where  Performance-Based  Awards  are  Not  Granted .  If  youpermanently
 transfer your Continuous Status to an Affiliate or into a position where performance-based Plan Awards are notgranted
 (other  than  where  Paragraph  6.B  applies),  then  the  Performance  Measures  (including  any  applicable  weightingsthereof)
 and Performance Goals applicable to your Performance Units will be prorated and adjusted in the same method asset
 forth in Paragraph 9.B.1. and 9.B.2. above; provided  however ,  that for the purposes of Paragraph 9.B.2., you will beinformed of the applicable performance criteria in respect of the subsequent Incentive Years in your Performance Period.
D. 
Transfers  to New Position with Same Employer .  If you transfer to a position with the same Employer (as definedherein)
 but your new position is subject to different applicable Performance Measures (including any applicable weightingsthereof)
 and  Performance  Goals,  then  the  Performance  Measures  (including  any  applicable  weightings  thereof)  andPerformance
 Goals applicable to your Performance Units for the remainder of the Performance Period will be prorated andadjusted using the same methodology as described in Paragraphs 9.B.1. and 9.B.2. above.
10. 
Taxes and Tax Withholding . A. 
You  agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your Performance Units andacknowledge that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice.
B. 
You  acknowledge  that,  regardless  of  any  action  taken  by  Walmart  (or  if  different,  the  Employer),  the  ultimateliability
 for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-relateditems
 related  to  your  participation  in  the  Plan  and  legally  applicable  to  you  (“Tax-Related  Items”)  is  and  remains  yourresponsibility
 and  may  exceed  the  amount  actually  withheld  by  Walmart  or  the  Employer.  You  further  acknowledge  thatWalmart
 and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Itemsin connection with any aspect of the Performance Units, including, but not limited to, the
6

grant, vesting or settlement of the Performance Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement andthe
 receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the PerformanceUnits
 or  any  aspect  of  the  Performance  Units  to  reduce  or  eliminate  your  liability  for  Tax-Related  Items  or  achieve  anyparticular
 tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge thatWalmart
 and/or  the  Employer  (or  your  former  employer,  as  applicable)  may  be  required  to  withhold  or  account  for  Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
C. 
Prior  to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangementssatisfactory
 to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart and/or theEmployer,
 or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related
 Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the Vested Performance Units. In the event that suchwithholding
 in  Shares  is  problematic  under  applicable  tax  or  securities  law  or  has  materially  adverse  accountingconsequences,
 by your acceptance of the Performance Units and this Agreement, you authorize and direct Walmart and anybroker
 or  other  third  party  designated  by  Walmart  to  sell  on your  behalf  a  whole  number  of  Shares  corresponding  to theVested Performance
 Units that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient tosatisfy the obligation for Tax-Related
 Items. However, Walmart may also require you to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by anyother method of withholding it authorizes, in its sole discretion, including through withholding from your wages or other cash
compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D. 
Depending  on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Itemsby
 considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximumapplicable
 rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, youare
 deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Vested Performance Units, notwithstanding that anumber of the Shares are withheld solely for the purpo
se of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding wholeShares,
 an excess amount of tax is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities orregulatory
 body. In the event that any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you maybe
 entitled to receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Shareequivalent.
E. 
Finally,  you  agree  to  pay  to  Walmart  or  the  Employer  any  amount  of  Tax-Related  Items  that  Walmart  or  theEmployer
 may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied bythe
 means previously described. Walmart may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, ifyou fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
11. 
Performance  Units Not Transferable .  The Performance Units may not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledgedor
 otherwise disposed of or encumbered at any time prior to vesting of the Performance Units and the issuance of the underlyingShares. Any attempted action in violation of this Paragraph 11 shall be null, void, and without effect.

 on  a  Form  T1135  (Foreign  Income  Verification  Statement),  if  the  total  cost  of  your  specified  foreign  property  exceedsC$100,000

 threshold is exceeded because of other specified foreign property that you hold. When Shares are acquired, their cost generallyis

 Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the related deduction will not be limited under Section162(m) (the “First Non-162(m) Year”) in accordance with the Deferral Procedures under the Plan and Code Section 409A. However,
if

10.     
Taxes and Tax Withholding . A. 
You  agree  to  consult  with  any  tax  advisors  you  think  necessary  in  connection  with  your  Restricted  Stock  andacknowledge
 that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice. Please see Paragraph 10.Fregarding Section 83(b) elections.
B. 
You  acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you(the
 “Employer”), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment onaccount or other tax-related items related
 to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related Items”), is andremains
 your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. You further acknowledgethat
 Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items inconnection
 with any aspect of the Restricted Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the RestrictedStock,
 the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit toand
 are under  no obligation  to structure  the terms of the grant  or any aspect  of the  Restricted  Stock  to reduce  or eliminate  yourliability for
 Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than onejurisdiction,
 you  acknowledge  that  Walmart  and/or  the  Employer  (or  your  former  employer,  as  applicable)  may  be  required  towithhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
C. 
Prior  to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangementssatisfactory
 to  Walmart  and  the  Employer  to  satisfy  all  Tax-Related  Items.  In  this  regard,  you  authorize  Walmart  and/or  theEmployer
 or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-RelatedItems
 by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the vested Restricted Stock. In the event that such withholding inShares
 is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by your acceptanceof the Restricted Stock and this
4

Agreement, you authorize and direct Walmart, and any broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf awhole
 number of Shares corresponding to the vested Restricted Stock that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate togenerate
 cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items. However, Walmart may also require you to satisfythe
 Tax-Related Items by any other method of withholding it authorizes, in its sole discretion, including through withholding fromyour wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D. 
Depending  on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Itemsby considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable
rates. Further, if
 the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to havebeen
 issued  the  full  number  of  Shares  subject  to  the  vested  Restricted  Stock,  notwithstanding  that  a  number  of  the  Shares  arewithheld solely
 for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole Shares, an excess amount of taxis
 withheld,  such  excess  tax  will  be  reported  and  paid  to  the  applicable  tax  authorities  or  regulatory  body.  In  the  event  that  anyexcess
 amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled to receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E. 
Finally,  you  agree  to  pay  to  Walmart  or  the  Employer  any  amount  of  Tax-Related  Items  that  Walmart  or  theEmployer
 may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by themeans
 previously described. Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to complywith your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

 Restricted  Stock  in  any  year  would,  when  considered  with  your  other  compensation,  result  in  Walmart’sinability
 to deduct the value of such Shares because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Code Section 162(m), thenWalmart
 shall  defer  the  delivery  of  such  Shares  until  the  first  year  in  which  Walmart  reasonably  anticipates  that  the  relateddeduction will not
 be limited under Section 162(m) (the “First Non-162(m) Year”) in accordance with the Deferral Procedures underthe
 Plan and Code Section 409A. However, if you have made an irrevocable election to defer such Shares to a date later than theFirst

B. You  acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you(the
 “Employer”), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment onaccount or other tax-related items related
 to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related Items”), is andremains
 your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. You further acknowledgethat
 Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items inconnection with
 any aspect of the Performance-Based Restricted Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlementof the Performance-Based Restricted Stock, the
 subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of anydividends; and
 (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Performance-Based Restricted Stock to reduce or
 eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if youare
 subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your formeremployer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
C. 
Prior  to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangementssatisfactory
 to  Walmart  and  the  Employer  to  satisfy  all  Tax-Related  Items.  In  this  regard,  you  authorize  Walmart  and/or  theEmployer
 or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-RelatedItems
 by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the vested Performance-Based Restricted Stock. In the event thatsuch
 withholding in Shares is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences,by
 your  acceptance  of  the  Performance-Based  Restricted  Stock  and  this  Agreement,  you  authorize  and  direct  Walmart,  and  anybroker
 or  other  third  party  designated  by  Walmart  to  sell  on  your  behalf  a  whole  number  of  Shares  corresponding  to  the  vestedPerformance-B
ased Restricted Stock that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficientto
 satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items. However, Walmart may also require you to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by anyother
 method  of  withholding  it  authorizes,  in  its  sole  discretion,  including  through  withholding  from  your  wages  or  other  cashcompensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D. 
Depending  on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Itemsby considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable
rates. Further, if
 the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to havebeen
 issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Performance-Based Restricted Stock, notwithstanding that a number ofthe Shares
 are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole Shares, an excessamount
 of tax is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities or regulatory body. In the eventthat
 any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled to receive a refund of anyover-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E. 
Finally,  you  agree  to  pay  to  Walmart  or  the  Employer  any  amount  of  Tax-Related  Items  that  Walmart  or  theEmployer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your
5

participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or theproceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

Deferral . A. 
Mandatory Deferral. If  Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of the RSUs inany
 year would, when considered with your other compensation, result in Walmart’s inability to deduct the value of suchShares because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, then
3

Walmart shall defer the delivery of such Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the relateddeduction
 will  not  be  limited  under  Section  162(m)  of  the  Code  (the  “First  Non-162(m)  Year”)  in  accordance  with  thedeferral
 procedures  established  pursuant  to  the  Plan  and  Section  409A  of  the  Code.  However,  if  you  have  made  anirrevocable
 election to defer such Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m) Year, then Walmart shall not deliver suchShares
 in the First Non-162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your Shares in accordance with your irrevocable election andthe deferral procedures established pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code.
B. 
Elective  Deferral of Restricted Stock Units .  If you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares underlying yourRestricted
 Stock award to a future date in accordance with Section 8.7 of the Plan and rules and procedures relating thereto,you
 will be advised as to when any such deferral election  must be made and the rules and procedures  applicable  to suchdeferral election.
10. 
Taxes and Tax Withholding . A. 
You  agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your RSUs and acknowledgethat you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice.
B. 
You  acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you(the
 “Employer”), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, paymenton
 account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-RelatedItems”)
 is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. Youfurther
 acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatmentof
 any  Tax-Related  Items  in  connection  with  any  aspect  of  the  RSUs,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  grant,  vesting  orsettlement
 of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends;and
 (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the RSUs or any aspect of the RSUs to reduceor
 eliminate  your  liability  for  Tax-Related  Items  or  achieve  any  particular  tax  result.  Further,  if  you  are  subject  to  Tax-Related
 Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer,as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
C. 
Prior  to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangementssatisfactory
 to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart and/or theEmployer,
 or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related
 Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the vested RSUs. In the event that such withholdingin
 Shares is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by youracceptance
 of  the  RSUs  and  this  Agreement,  you  authorize  and  direct  Walmart,  and  any  broker  or  other  third  partydesignated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a whole
4

number of Shares corresponding to the vested RSUs that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to generatecash
 proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items. However, Walmart may also require you to satisfythe
 Tax-Related Items by any other method of withholding it authorizes, in its sole discretion, including through withholdingfrom your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D. 
Depending  on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Itemsby
 considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximumapplicable
 rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, youare
 deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of theShares
 are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole Shares, anexcess
 amount of tax is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities or regulatorybody.
 In the event that any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitledto receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E. 
Finally,  you  agree  to  pay  to  Walmart  or  the  Employer  any  amount  of  Tax-Related  Items  that  Walmart  or  theEmployer
 may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied bythe
 means previously described. Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail tocomply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
11. 
RSUs Not Transferable . The RSUs may not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of or encumbered at
 any time prior to vesting of the RSUs and the issuance of the underlying Shares. Any attempted action in violation ofthis Paragraph 11 shall be null, void, and without effect.
12. 
Country-Specific  Appendix .  Notwithstanding any provision in these Global Share-Settled RSU Notification and Termsand
 Conditions to the contrary, the grant of RSUs also shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in any appendixattached
 hereto  (the  “Appendix”)  with  respect  to  certain  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  specific  to  your  country.  Moreover,  if  yourelocate
 to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to theextent

Table of ContentsItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("
Walmart," the "Company" or "we") is engaged in retail and wholesale operations in various formats around the world. Through ouroperations, we help people around 
the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – in retail stores or through our e-commerce and mobilecapabilities. Through innova
tion, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping. Physical retailencompasses our brick and mor
tar presence in each of the markets in which we operate. Digital retail is comprised of our e-commerce websites and mobilecommerce applica
tions. Each week, we serve nearly 260 million customers who visit our over 11,500 stores under 63 banners in 28 countries and e-commercewebsites in 11 countries. Our stra
tegy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. By leadingon price we earn the trust o
f our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"). EDLPis our pricing philosophy under which we pr
ice items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotionalactivity. Price lead
ership is core to who we are. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along toour customers. Our digital and phys
ical presence, which we are investing in to integrate, provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere.We strive to give our custo
mers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience.Our operations consist of thre
e reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.•
Walmart U.S. is our largest segment with three primary store formats, as well as digital retail. Of our three reportable segments, Walmart U.S. hashistorically had the high
est gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, it has historically contributed the greatest amount tothe Company's net sales and opera
ting income.•
Walmart International consists of our operations outside of the U.S. and includes retail, wholesale and other businesses. These businesses consist ofnumerous formats, including sup
ercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs, cash & carry, home improvement,specialty electronics, apparel 
stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International islower than that of Walm
art U.S. because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions,as well as by adding retail, whol
esale and other units, and expanding digital retail.•
Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs as well as digital retail. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is asignificant component of 
the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentageof net sales than our other s
egments.Each of our segments contribu
tes to the Company's operating results differently, but each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company'snet sales and operating in
come in recent years.Our fiscal year ends on 
January 31 for our U.S. and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendaryear basis. Our business is seasonal 
to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, ourhighest sales volume and oper
ating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 . This discussion, which presents our resu
lts for periods occurring in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 ("fiscal 2016 "), January 31, 2015 ("fiscal 2015 ") and January 31, 2014 
("fiscal 2014 ") should be read in conjunction wi th our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for thisdiscussion to provide the read
er with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financialstatements from period to 
period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses toassess the Company's performanc
e. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of the three segments of our business to provide abetter understanding of how ea
ch of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.Throughout this Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable storeand club sales and other me
asures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certaincorporate overhead allocation
s, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including certaincorporate overhead al
locations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. When we do so,the previous period amounts and b
alances are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.Comparable store and club sa
les is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such storesand clubs, including e-comm
erce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable store andclub sales includes sales 
from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as e-commerce sales. We measure the e-c
ommerce sales impact by including those sales initiated through our websites and our mobile commerce applications andfulfilled through our e-c
ommerce distribution facilities, as well as an estimate for sales initiated online and on our mobile commerce applications, but fulfilledthrough our stores and clubs. Sales of 
a store that has changed in format are excluded from3

Table of Contentscomparable store and c
lub sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail squarefeet of more than fiv
e percent. Comparable store and club sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry. The method ofcalculating compar
able store and club sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable store and club sales is not necessarilycomparable to simil
arly titled measures reported by other companies.In discussing our operating resu
lts, we use the term "currency exchange rates" to refer to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for allcountries where the funct
ional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We calculate the effect of changes in currencyexchange rates from th
e prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchangerates, and current per
iod activity translated using the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results ofthis calculation as th
e impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operatingincome, of the Company and the W
almart International segment in the future.We made certain reclassifications to
 prior period amounts or balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. These reclassifications did notimpact the Company's operat
ing income or consolidated net income.The Retail Industry
We operate in the highly 
competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar,variety and specialty s
tores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional orinternational chains or ha
ve a national or international online presence. We compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations, as well as inattracting and ret
aining quality employees (whom we call "associates"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, butnot limited to: cat
astrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer creditavailability, cost of goods, 
currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions,insurance costs, interes
t rates, labor costs, tax rates, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operatingresults and on certain r
isks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K forthe fiscal year ended 
January 31, 2016 , and in the discussion under "Cautiona ry Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information" in ourAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fisca
l year ended January 31, 2016 . 4

Table of ContentsCompany Performance Metrics
We are committed 
to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust ourbusiness strategies to ensur
e we maintain our strong leadership position around the world and in the countries in which we operate.  For several years, ourperformance metrics emphasized three
 financial priorities: growth, leverage and returns.  We are currently making strategic investments in our associates and in theintegration of digita
l and physical retail.  These investments support long-term growth while we maintain our heritage of everyday low prices which are supportedby everyday low cost.  During this tim
e of increased investments, we have shifted our financial priorities to focus primarily on growth, balanced by the long-termhealth of the Company including 
returns.  We will continue to grow through new stores and clubs, and through increasing comparable store and club sales, whichinclude our e-commer
ce sales.  While leverage remains important to everyday low cost, during this time of increased investments, operating expenses may grow ata rate that is grea
ter than or equal to the rate of our net sales growth, and operating income may grow at a rate that is equal to or less than the rate of our net salesgrowth.
Our objective of balancing g
rowth with returns means that we are focused on efficiently employing assets for return on investment and more effectively managingworking capital to delive
r strong free cash flow. We will also continue to provide returns to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.Growth
We measure our growth prim
arily by the amount of the period-over-period growth in our net sales and our comparable store and club sales. We also review theprogress of our di
gital retail investments by measuring the impact e-commerce sales have on our comparable store and club sales. At times, we make strategicinvestments which are focus
ed on the long-term growth of the Company. These strategic investments may not benefit net sales and comparable store and club salesin the near term.

creased $3.6 billion or 0.7% for fiscal 2016 and increased $9.2 billion or 1.9% for fiscal 2015 , when compared to the previous f iscalyear. Net sales for fiscal 
2016 were negatively impac ted by $17.1 billion or 3.5% as a result of fluctua tions in currency exchange rates and a $1.9 billion decrease in fuel sales primar
ily due to the lower selling prices of fuel at our Sam's Club segment. The negative effect of such factors was offset by 1.3% year-over-year growth in retail square f
eet, positive comparable sales in the Walmart U.S. segment and higher e-commerce sales across the Company. The increase in net sales forfiscal 2015 was primarily du
e to 3.0% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the U.S. and higher e-commerce sales across theCompany. The increase was parti
ally offset by $5.3 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates for fiscal 2015.Calendar Comparable Store and Club Sales
Comparable store and club sa
les is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such storesand clubs, including e-comm
erce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparablestore and club sales using the 
retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable store and clubsales using the retail 
calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable store and club sales below, we are referring to ourcalendar comparable store and
 club sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparablestore and club sales also di
ffer from the retail calendar comparable store and club sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar comparable store andclub sales, as well as the i
mpact of fuel, for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , were as follows:

les in the U.S., including fuel, increased 0.3% and 0.5% in fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscalyear. The fiscal 
2016 total U.S. comparable store and club sales were positively impacted5

Table of Contentsby continued traffic impro
vement and higher e-commerce sales at the Walmart U.S. segment, offset to a significant degree by the negative impact of lower fuelsales primarily due to lo
wer fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. E-commerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately 0.2% and 0.6% for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respect
ively, for fiscal 2016 . The fiscal 2015  total U.S. comparable store and club sales were positively impacted by higher trafficduring the end of the fisca
l year. E-commerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately 0.3% and 0.2% for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club,respectively, for fiscal 
2015 . As we continue to add new stores and clubs in 
the U.S., we do so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units.We estimate the neg
ative impact on comparable store and club sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately 0.8% and 0.9% infiscal 2016 and 2015, respectiv
ely. Our estimate is calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs, which are identified basedon their proximity to the n
ew stores and clubs, to those of nearby non-impacted stores and clubs, in each case, as measured after the new stores and clubs areopened.
Strategic Growth Investments
During fiscal 
2016, we made capital invest ments globally of $11.5 billion . These capital investm ents primarily consisted of payments to add new stores and clubs,remodel existing stores 
and clubs, construct distribution centers and invest in technology. In addition, we made an incr emental operational investment of $296million in e-comme
rce in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. We also made operational investments of approximately $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016 in connectionwith the new associate wage stru
cture and comprehensive associate training and educational programs announced in first quarter of fiscal 2016. These operationalinvestments will continue 
into the year ending January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017").6

Table of ContentsReturns
While we are focused pri
marily on growth, we also place a priority on generating returns to ensure our approach is appropriately balanced. We generate returns byefficiently deploying 
assets and effectively managing working capital. We monitor these efforts through our return on investment and free cash flow metrics, whichwe discuss below. In addition, we are fo
cused on providing returns to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in theLiquidity and Capital Resources s
ection.Return on Investment
Management believes r
eturn on investment ("ROI") is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart isdeploying its assets
. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.ROI was 
15.5% and 16.9% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The decl ine in ROI was primarily due to our decrease in operatingincome, as well as continued 
capital investments.We define ROI as adj
usted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the fiscal year dividedby average invested capi
tal during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus averageaccumulated depreciation and a
verage accumulated amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factorequal to the rent for th
e fiscal year multiplied by a factor of eight. When we have discontinued operations, we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations.Our calculation of ROI is conside
red a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that areincluded and excluded
 in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles inthe U.S. ("GAAP"). For example, we exclude the impa
ct of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of ourcalculation of ROI. In addit
ion, we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. We considerreturn on assets ("ROA") to be the fin
ancial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculationof ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidat
ed income from continuing operations for the period divided by average total assets of continuing operationsfor the period) because ROI: 
adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets of continuing operations forthe impact of accumulated depreciati
on and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total investedcapital. Because of the 
adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful toinvestors than ROA.
Although ROI is a standard financia
l metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculateour ROI may differ from the 
methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.7

Table of ContentsThe calculation of ROI, along with 
a reconciliation to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:

Table of ContentsFree Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non
-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, howeve r, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additionalcash from our business operat
ions, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should beconsidered in addition to, r
ather than as a substitute for, consolidated income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided byoperating activities as a meas
ure of our liquidity.We define free cash 
flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We generatedfree cash flow of 
$15.9 billion , $16.4 billion and $10.1 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The decr ease in free cash flow in fiscal 2016 from fiscal 
2015 was primarily due to lower in come from continuing operations, partially offset by lower capital spending and improved working capital management.Walmart's definit
ion of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that themeasure does not deduct the p
ayments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, webelieve it is import
ant to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Although other companies repor
t their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used byWalmart's management to calculate o
ur free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.The following table sets for
th a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe tobe the GAAP financial measure mos
t directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash usedin financing activities.

mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, decreased 0.7% for fiscal 2016 and increased 2.0% for fiscal 
2015 when compared to the previous f iscal year. Net sales decreased 0.7% for fiscal 2016 and increased 1.9% for fiscal 2015 when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 
2016 , net sales were negative ly impacted by $17.1 billion as a result of fluctua tions in currency exchange rates and a decrease of $1.9 billion in fuel sales that resu
lted primarily from lower selling prices for fuel at our Sam's Club segment. The negative effect of such factors on our consolidated net saleswas partially offset by
 the 1.3% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the Walmart U.S. segment and higher e-commerce salesacross the Company. For fiscal 
2015 , the increase in net sa les was primarily due to 3.0% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales inthe U.S. and higher e-commerc
e sales across the Company. The increase was partially offset by $5.3 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currencyexchange rates for fiscal 
2015 . Our gross profit rate incr
eased 29 basis points for fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015. I mproved margins in food, general merchandise, and consumables inthe Walmart U.S. segment posi
tively impacted our gross profit rate. Changes in the merchandise mix in the Walmart International segment and a reduction in lowmargin fuel sales in th
e Sam's Club segment also positively impacted our gross profit rate, while continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure at the Walmart U.S.segment negatively imp
acted our gross profit rate. Our gross profit rate was relatively flat in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014.Operating expenses as a perc
entage of net sales increased 91 and 6 basis points for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year.For fiscal 
2016 , the increase in opera ting expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage expense at the Walmart U.S. segment dueto the new associate wage stru
cture and increased associate hours to improve the overall customer experience, the approximately $0.9 billion charge for the storeclosures announced in January 2016 and ou
r continued investments in digital retail and information technology. For f iscal 2015 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage o
f net sales was due to our continued investments in digital retail and higher health-care expenses in the U.S. from increased enrollmentin our associate health
-care plans and medical cost inflation, the $249 million impact of wage and hour litigation in the U.S., as well as expenses of $148 millionrelated to the closur
e of approximately 30 underperforming stores in Japan. The impact of these factors in the increase of operating expenses as a percentage of netsales for fiscal 
2015 was partially offset by ne arly $1.0 billion of aggregated expenses incurred in fiscal 2014.Our effective income 
tax rate was 30.3% , 32.2% and 32.9% for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Our effecti ve tax rate fluctuates from period to periodand may be impacted by a numb
er of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in laws, outcomes ofadministrative audi
ts, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutoryrate to the effective income tax rate
s for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 is presented in Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."As a result of the factors d
iscussed above, we reported $15.1 billion , $16.8 billion and $16.6 billion of consolidated income f rom continuing operations for fiscal2016 
, 2015 and 2014 , respectively; a decrease of  $1.7 billion for fiscal 2016 and an increase of $263 mil lion for fiscal 2015 when compared to the previous f iscalyear. Diluted income fro

rily due to year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.4% and 3.2% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, as well as increases incomparable store sales of 
1.0% and 0.6% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Positi ve customer traffic and higher e-commerce sales contributed to the increasesin comparable store sa
les in both periods.The fiscal 
2016 gross profit rate increased 12 basis points compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to improved margin in food, general merchandise,and consumables, partial
ly offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. The fiscal 2015 gross profit rate decr eased 12 basis points when compared to theprevious fiscal year, primaril
y due to the result of the segment's strategic focus on price investment, pharmacy cost inflation, reductions in third-partyreimbursement rates and chan
ges in merchandise mix.Operating expenses as a perc
entage of segment net sales increased 113 and 24 basis points for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, when compa red to the previousfiscal year. For fiscal 
2016 , the increase was prima rily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the new associate wage structure and increased associatehours. Enhancements to the custo
mer-facing areas of the store to improve the overall customer experience drove the increase in associate hours as well as increasedmaintenance expenses. In 
addition, the approximately $700 million charge for the closures of 150 stores announced in January 2016, an increase in store associateincentive expense and our con
tinued investments in digital retail and information technology contributed to the fiscal 2016 increase in operating expenses as apercentage of segment n
et sales. For fiscal  2015 , the increase in opera ting expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily driven by higher health-care expenses from increased
 enrollment in our associate health-care plans and medical cost inflation. In addition, expenses from severe winter storms early infiscal 2015 contributed to 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales. As a result of the factors d
iscussed above, segment operating income was $19.1 billion , $21.3 billion and $21.8 billion during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

entage of segment net sales increased 44 basis points for fiscal 2016 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. The increase inoperating expenses as a per
centage of segment net sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the approximately $150 million charge for the announced closureof 115 underperforming stores 
in Brazil and other Latin American markets in January 2016, increased employment claim contingencies and higher utility rates inBrazil and continued i
nvestments in digital retail and information technology.Operating expenses as a perc

rimarily due to declines in comparable club sales, which were driven by a decrease of $1.9 billion in fuel sales that resu lted primarilyfrom lower selling prices
 for fuel. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.2% and higher e-commerce sales at samsclub.com. The fisc
al 2015 increase in net sales was primarily due to year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 2.5%, driven by the addition of 15 newclubs, partially offse
t by a decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices. Comparable club sales were flat for fiscal 2015.Gross profit rate incre
ased 30 basis points for fiscal 2016 and decreased 12 basis points fo r fiscal 2015 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. For fiscal 2016 , the increase was prima
rily due to the reduction in low margin fuel sales and lower merchandise acquisition costs, partially offset by the segment's continuedinvestment in the Cash Rewards progr
am. Fo r fiscal 2015 , the gross profit rate de creased primarily due to the segment's investment in the Cash Rewards program,changes in merchandise m
ix, and commodity cost inflation, partially offset by an increased gross profit rate on fuel sales.Membership and other incom 
e increased 5.3% and 7.7% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2016 , the increase was primari
ly the result of increased membership upgrades and Plus Member renewals. For fiscal 2015 , the increase was primaril y the result of increasedmembership upgrades, Plus Membe

entage of segment net sales increased 67 basis points for fiscal 2016 and decreased 16 basis points fo r fiscal 2015 , when compared to the previous fiscal yea
r. For fiscal 2016 , the increase in opera ting expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to lower fuel sales, an increasein wage expense due to the new associ
ate wage structure, our continued investments in new clubs, digital retail and information technology, and the approximately$60 million charge for c
lub closures announced in January 2016. For fiscal 2015 , the decrease in opera ting expenses as a percentage of segment net sales wasprimarily due to bett
er expense management in a number of areas, including the optimization of the new in-club staffing structure announced in fiscal 2014, whichresulted in decreases 
in wage expense and payroll taxes.As a result of the factors d

Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The strength and stability o
f our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities,supplemented with our long-te
rm debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that supportthe long-term growth of our ope
rations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock andshare repurchases. We be
lieve our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global expansion activities, pay dividends andfund our share repurchases fo
r the foreseeable future.Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

ities for fiscal 2016 , when compared to the previous f iscal year, was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations,partially offset by i
mproved working capital management. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2015 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was prima
rily due to the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as well as the timing of income tax payments.In fiscal 2017, the Company will mov
e forward with the second year of our new associate wage structure combined with comprehensive associate training andeducational programs which was 
announced in fiscal 2016. We anticipate cash flows provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund these programs infiscal 2017 and future yea
rs.Cash Equivalents and Working Capital
Cash and cash equivalents were 
$8.7 billion and $9.1 billion at January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Our working capi tal deficit was $4.4 billion and $2.0billion 
at January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The incr ease in our working capital deficit reflects the Company's efficient leverage achieved throughimproved working capital m
anagement, in addition to the timing of payments. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cashin funding operations, consisten
t access to the capital markets and in providing returns to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and sharerepurchases.
We use intercompany fin
ancing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum costpossible. We do not believe i
t will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cashflows provided by operating act
ivities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, we intend, with only certain exceptions, tocontinue to indefinite
ly reinvest our earnings held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations. When the income earned, either from operations or throughintercompany financing 
arrangements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at local country tax rates, which are generally lower than the U.S.statutory rate, we rea
lize an effective tax rate benefit. If our intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within our foreignoperations could be repat
riated to the U.S., although any repatriation under current U.S. tax laws would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicableforeign tax credits. W
e do not expect local laws, other limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of earnings held outside of the U.S. to have amaterial effe
ct on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.As of 
January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion , respectively, may not be freelytransferable to the U.S. due to

Growth Activities
In fiscal 2017, we plan to add betwe

tal expenditures and other cash requirements. For fiscal 2016 , the increase in net c ash flows provided by short-term borrowings partiallyoffset a larger $2.0 bil
lion decrease in long-term debt due within one year. For fiscal 2015 , more cash provided from ope rating activities combined with less cashused for share repurchases

From time to time, we repu
rchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. On October 13,2015, the Board of Directors repl
aced the previous $15.0 billion share repurchase progra m, which had $8.6 billion of remaining authorization f or share repurchasesas of that date, with a new 
$20.0 billion share repurchase progra m. As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program, the new share repurchase programhas no expiration date or oth
er restrictions limiting the period over which we can make share repurchases. At January 31, 2016 , authorization for $17.5 billion of share repurchases rem
ained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. TheCompany intends to utilize th
e current share repurchase authorization through the fiscal year ending January 31, 2018.We regularly review sha
re repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things,current cash needs, capa
city for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a significantmajority of the ongoing shar
e repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flows. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis,the number of shares repur
chased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 :  
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data)

 $4,112  $1,015  $6,683 Share repurchases incre
ased $3.1 billion for fiscal 2016 and decreased $5.7 billion fo r fiscal 2015 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. Forfiscal 
2016 , the increase in share repurchases resulted from our intention to utilize the current share repurchase authorization over the next two years. For fiscal2015 
, the decrease was a resul t of cash needs, reduced leverage and increased cash used in transactions with noncontrolling interests described further below.16

Table of ContentsSignificant Transactions with Noncontroll
ing InterestsAs described in Note 13 to our Consolidated Fin
ancial Statements, in July 2015, we completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest inYihaodian, our e-commerc
e operations in China, for approximately $760 million, using existing cash to complete this transaction and during fiscal 2015, wecompleted the purchase o
f substantially all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Walmart Chile for approximately $1.5 billion, using existing cash tocomplete this transaction.
Capital Resources
We believe cash flows fro
m continuing operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipatedoperating cash needs, which inc
lude funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, dividend payments and sharerepurchases.
We have strong commerc
ial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due atfavorable rates in c
apital markets. At January 31, 2016 , the ratings assigned to our co mmercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were asfollows:
Rating agency
  Commercial paper   Long-term debt Standard & Poor's
  A-1+   AA Moody's Investors Service
  P-1   Aa2 Fitch Ratings
  F1+   AA Credit rating agencies 
review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.Accordingly, we are not able to p
redict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings includechanges in our operating per
formance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt andcapitalization, and 
changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs orimpair our ability to access
 capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratingscould impair our ability t
o access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to relymore heavily on more expens
ive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper ordebt securities. Each r
ating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of anyother rating. Moreover, e
ach credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.17

"Long-term debt" includes the fair value of our derivatives classified as fair value hedges. (2)
"Capital lease and financing obligations" includes executory costs and imputed interest related to capital lease and financing obligations that are not yet recorded. Refer to Note 11 in the"Notes to the Consolidated Financial State
ments" for more information.Additionally, the Company has 
$15.0 billion in undrawn committed lines o f credit which, if drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of theCompany's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Estimated interest p
ayments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding at January 31, 2016 , and management's forec astedmarket rates for our v
ariable rate debt.Purchase obligations include 
legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capitalexpenditures, software acqu
isition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders for inventory and other services are not includedin the table above. Purchase o
rders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations forthe purchase of goods or servic
es are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed orminimum quantities to b
e purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based onour current inventory needs 
and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, theobligations under these cont
racts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.The expected timing for p
ayment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid withrespect to some unrecord
ed contractual commitments may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amountsfor some obligations.
In addition to the amounts shown in th
e table above, $607 million of unrecognized tax benef its are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded asliabilities. The ti
ming of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" foradditional discussion of unre
cognized tax benefits.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
In addition to the unrecord
ed contractual obligations presented above, we have entered into certain arrangements, as discussed below, for which the timing ofpayment, if any, is unknown.
The Company has future lease co
mmitments for land and buildings for approximately 215 future locations. These lease commitments have lease terms rangingfrom 
10 to 30 years and provide for certain minimum rentals. If leases for all of those future locations had been executed as of February 1, 2016, payments underoperating leases would incr
ease by $34 million for fiscal 2017 , based on current estima tes.In connection with certa
in long-term debt issuances, we could be liable for early termination payments if certain unlikely events were to occur. At January 31, 2016 , the aggregate term
ination payment would have been $44 million . The arrangement pursuant to which this payment could be made will expire in fiscal 2019 . 18

Table of ContentsMarket Risk
In addition to the risks inhe
rent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in currency exchangerates.
The analysis presented below fo
r each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does notrepresent our view of futur
e market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality,however, a change in one facto
r could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in 
interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt issuances. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk bymanaging the mix of fixed 
and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2016 , the net fair value of ou r interest rate swaps increasedapproximately  
$162 million primarily due to addit ional interest rate swaps acquired in fiscal 2016 and fluctuations in mark et interest rates.The table below provides infor
mation about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table represents theprincipal cash flows and re
lated weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flowsand weighted-average int
erest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows tobe exchanged under the contr
acts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates at January 31, 2016 .

The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives c lassified as fair value hedges.As of 
January 31, 2016 , our variable rate bor rowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 19% of our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on 
January 31, 2016 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change byapproximately 
$79 million . 19

Table of ContentsForeign Currency Risk
We are exposed to fluctu
ations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S. For fiscal 2016 , movements in currency ex
change rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's subsidiaries in Canada, the UnitedKingdom, Japan, Mexico and Chile were th
e primary cause of the  $4.7 billion net loss in the currency t ranslation and other category of accumulated othercomprehensive income (
loss). We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps and designating certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term d
ebt as net investment hedges.We hold currency swaps to hedge th
e currency exchange component of our net investments and also to hedge the currency exchange rate fluctuation exposureassociated with the fore
casted payments of principal and interest of non-U.S. denominated debt. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability positionof 
$290 million at January 31, 2016 and in a liability posit ion of $110 million at January 31, 2015 . The change in the fair va lue of these swaps was due tofluctuations in currency e
xchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2016 . A hypothetical 10% increas e ordecrease in the curr
ency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate at January 31, 2016 would have resulted in a loss or ga in in the value of theswaps of 
$445 million . A hypothetical 10% change in in terest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect at January 31, 2016 would have resulted in a loss or gain in value of th
e swaps of $14 million . In addition to currency swaps, we hav
e designated foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of ourforeign operations. At 
January 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had £2.5 billion of outstanding long-term deb t designated as a hedge of our net investment in the UnitedKingdom. At 
January 31, 2016 , a hypothetical 10% incr ease or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a gainor loss in the value of the deb
t of $324 million . In addition, we had outstanding long- term debt of ¥10 billion at January 31, 2016 and ¥100 billion at January 31,2015 
, that was designated as a hedge o f our net investment in Japan. At January 31, 2016 , a hypothetical 10% incr ease or decrease in value of the U.S. dollarrelative to the Japan
ese yen would have resulted in a gain or loss in the value of the debt of $8 million . In certain countries, we
 also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated innon-functional currencies.

Table of ContentsSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates
Management strives to r
eport our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex andrequire us to use technic
al terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in theU.S. These principles require us to 
make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in ourfinancial statem
ents. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.Management continually 
reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is asummary of our critic
al accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.Inventories
We value inventories a
t the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method forsubstantially all of th
e Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory methodof accounting, using the firs
t-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retail method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market sincepermanent markdowns are i
mmediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued based on theweighted-average cost using 
the LIFO method.Under the retail method o
f accounting, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to eachmerchandise grouping's ret
ail value. The FIFO cost-to-retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity. The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring anyLIFO provision is based on the initia
l margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns. The retail method of accountingrequires management 
to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the amount of grossprofit recognized. Judgmen
ts made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage. When management determines the ability to sell inventoryhas diminished, markdowns for cl
earance activity and the related cost impact are recorded. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include currentand anticipated demand, 
customer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends. Changes in weather and customer preferences couldcause material ch
anges in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year.When necessary, we record a L
IFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end.Our LIFO provision is calculated bas
ed on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. At January 31, 2016 and 2015 , our inventories valued at LIFO approx
imated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.We provide for estima
ted inventory losses, or shrinkage, between physical inventory counts on the basis of a historical percentage of sales. Following annualinventory counts, the provision is 
adjusted to reflect updated historical results.Impairment of Assets
We evaluate long-liv
ed assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate their carrying amount
s may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditionsand operational perfor
mance, such as operating income and cash flows. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cashflows, which is generally at th
e individual store level or, in certain markets, at the market group level. The variability of these factors depends on a number ofconditions, including uncert
ainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. Thesefactors could cause manageme
nt to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in managementdetermining the value o
f long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets.Goodwill and other indefinite
-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes incircumstances indicate that the 
value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether aquantitative impairment test is 
necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit ismore likely than not less 
than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then aquantitative impairment test w
ould be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows,growth rates and economic and 
market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation methodsuch as discounted cash flow or a r
elative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwilland other indefinite-
lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, futureoperating results could
 be materially impacted.21

Table of ContentsAs of 
January 31, 2016 , the fair value of ce rtain indefinite-lived intangible assets held in our International segment exceeded its carrying value of $398 million byapproximately 5%. Manage
ment will continue to monitor the fair value of these assets in future periods.Income Taxes
Income taxes have a signi
ficant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, thedetermination of our prov
ision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Oureffective income tax rate is affected 
by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuationallowances, changes in tax l
aw, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and internationaloperations where the statu
tory rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.Our tax returns are routin
ely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions arerecorded in our financi
al statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, fromtaxing authorities. When 
facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Weaccount for uncertain 
tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in thefinancial statem
ents. This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductibleand taxable items.
Deferred tax assets rep
resent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporarydifferences between th
e financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred taxassets are evaluated 
for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factorsare considered when assessing wheth
er it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations offuture taxable income, carryfor
ward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated byassessing the adequac
y of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings andavailable tax planning strate
gies. This evaluation relies heavily on estimates.22

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("
Walmart" or the "Company") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – in retail stores orthrough the Company's e-commer
ce and mobile capabilities. Through innovation, the Company is striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlesslyintegrates digital 
and physical shopping. Each week, the Company serves nearly 260 million customers who visit its over 11,500 stores under 63 banners in 28countries and e-comme
rce websites in 11 countries. The Company's strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment anddeliver a great experience.
The Company's operations comprise 
three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Stat
ements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 ("fiscal 2016 "), January 31, 2015 
("fiscal 2015 ") and January 31, 2014 ("fiscal 2014 "). All material intercompany  accounts and transactions have been eliminated inconsolidation. Investments 
in unconsolidated affiliates, which are 50% or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements, are accounted forprimarily using the equi
ty method. These investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company's Consolidated Financial Sta
tements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31, for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadi an operations. TheCompany consolidates all othe
r operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events duringJanuary 
2016 that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Stat
ements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles requiremanagement to make estimates an
d assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect thedisclosure of contingent ass
ets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results may differ fr
om those estimates.Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments wi
th a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronicbenefits transfer t
ransactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactionsclassified as cash and c
ash equivalents totaled $3.4 billion and $2.9 billion at January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. In addit ion, cash and cash equivalentsincluded restricted cash of 
$362 million and $345 million at January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, which was prim arily related to cash collateral holdings fromvarious counterparties, a
s required by certain derivative and trust agreements.The Company's cash balances are h
eld in various locations around the world. Of the Company's $8.7 billion and $9.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents atJanuary 31, 2016 
and 2015 , respectively, $4.5 billion and $6.3 billion , respectively, were held ou tside of the U.S. and were generally utilized to support liquidityneeds in the Company's non-U.S. operations.
The Company uses intercompany fin
ancing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimumcost possible. Management does no
t believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipates the Company's domestic liquidityneeds will be met through cash 
flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, the Companyintends, with only certain ex
ceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest the Company's earnings held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations. When theincome earned, eithe
r from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at local country taxrates, which are genera
lly lower than the U.S. statutory rate, the Company realizes an effective tax rate benefit. If the Company's intentions with respect toreinvestment were to ch
ange, most of the amounts held within the Company's foreign operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation undercurrent U.S. tax laws would be subject to U.S. fed
eral income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. The Company does not expect local laws, other limitationsor potential taxes on ant
icipated future repatriations of earnings held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on the Company's overall liquidity, financialcondition or results of oper
ations.As of 
January 31, 2016 and 2015 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S.due to local laws or other r
estrictions.31

Table of ContentsReceivables
Receivables are stat
ed at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts. Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from:•
insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales;•
banks for customer credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process;•
consumer financing programs in certain international operations;•
suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and•
real estate transactions.The Walmart International segment
 offers a limited number of consumer credit products, primarily through its financial institutions in select countries. Thereceivable balance from consumer
 credit products was $1.0 billion , net of a reserve for doubt ful accounts of $70 million at January 31, 2016 , compared to a receivable balance of 
$1.2 billion , net of a reserve for doubt ful accounts of $ 114 million at January 31, 2015 . These balances are inc luded in receivables, net, inthe Company's Consolidated Balance Shee
ts.Inventories
The Company values inventories a
t the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out("LIFO") method for substantial
ly all of the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by theretail inventory me
thod of accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued atthe lower of cost or marke
t since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Clubsegment is valued based on the we
ighted-average cost using the LIFO method. At January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , the Company's inventories valued atLIFO approximated those inventor
ies as if they were valued at FIFO.Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are s
tated at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, whilecosts of normal repairs 
and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances andincludes the estimated usef
ul lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis: 
   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)
 Estimated Useful Lives  2016  2015 Land
 N/A  $25,624  $26,261 Buildings and improvements
 3-40 years  96,845  97,496 Fixtures and equipment
 1-30 years  47,033  45,044 Transportation equipment

 N/A  4,539  5,787 Property and equipment
   $176,958  $177,395 Accumulated depreciation
   (66,787 )  (63,115 ) Property and equipment, net
   $110,171  $114,280 Leasehold improvements are
 depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Totaldepreciation and amor
tization expense for property and equipment, property under financing obligations and property under capital leases for fiscal 2016 , 2015and 
2014 was $9.4 billion , $9.1 billion and $8.8 billion , respectively. Inter est costs capitalized on construction projects were $39 million , $59 million and $78million 
in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Leases
The Company estimates the exp
ected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude theabandonment of the lease 
at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. The expected termis used in the determina
tion of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, theuseful life of leasehold im
provements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures aremade for leasehold improveme
nts late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited tothe end of the renewal per
iod or economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimumlease payments in the Company's 
capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases.The Company is often involved in the 
construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor'sconstruction of the leas
ed assets result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, regardless of thesignificance of the pay
ments, Accounting Standards32

Table of ContentsCodification 840, 
Leases , ("ASC 840") defines those payments as auto matic indicators of ownership and requires the Company to capitalize the lessor's totalproject cost with a corr
esponding financing obligation. Upon completion of the lessor's project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis pursuant to ASC840 to determine if thes
e assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company isdeemed to have "continuing invo
lvement," the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and aregenerally amortiz
ed over the lease term.Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are sta
ted at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate thatthe carrying amount may no
t be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club levelor, in certain circu
mstances, a market group of stores. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' usefullives based on updated projec
tions. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measuredbased upon the fair value of 
the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Impairment charges oflong-lived assets for fis
cal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were not material. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess o
f the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reportingunit when acquired. Other acqui
red intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intendeduse of the related asse
t. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever eventsor changes in circumstance
s indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortizedon a straight-line basis ov
er the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.Goodwill is evaluated for imp
airment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitativeassessment is first performe
d to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing anassessment based on the quali
tative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of thereporting unit substantia
lly in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitativetest for goodwill impair
ment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flowmethod and relative m
arket-based approaches.The Company's reporting units were ev
aluated using a quantitative impairment test. Management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than thecarrying amount and, acco
rdingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.The following table refl
ects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2016 and 2015 : (Amounts in millions)

Goodwill recorded for fiscal 2016 and 2015 acquisitions relates to acquisitions that are not significan t, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company's Consolidated FinancialStatements.
Indefinite-lived in
tangible assets are included in other assets and deferred charges in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets are evaluated forimpairment based on the
ir fair values using valuation techniques which are updated annually based on the most recent variables and assumptions. There were noimpairment charges related to in
definite-lived intangible assets recorded for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Self Insurance Reserves
The Company self-insures a numbe
r of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certainemployee-related healthcare benefits.
 Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of thebalance sheet date on an und
iscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to

anding claim payments. On a regular basis, claims reserve valuations are provided by independent third-party actuaries to ensureliability estima
tes are appropriate. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage fo
r workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted f
or under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequencesattributable to differences bet
ween the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporarydifferences"). Deferred tax a
ssets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to berecovered or settled. The
 effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.Deferred tax assets ar
e evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.Many factors are conside
red when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings,expectations of future taxa
ble income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets isevaluated by assessin
g the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operatingearnings and available 
tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates.In determining the provis
ion for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and taxincome, and statutory inco
me tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.The Company records a liabil
ity for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Companyrecords interest and pen
alties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, inthe Company's Consolidated Statemen
ts of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures.Revenue Recognition 
    Sales
The Company recognizes sales r
evenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise to the customer. Digital retail sales includeshipping revenue and are re
corded upon delivery to the customer.Membership Fee Revenue
The Company recognizes membe
rship fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Thefollowing table summarizes
 membership fee activity for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 :

is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The deferred membership fee isincluded in accrued li
abilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.Shopping Cards
Customer purchases of shopping cards 
are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the shopping card.Shopping cards in the U.S. do not carry an expi
ration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their shopping cards for merchandise indefinitely.Shopping cards in certain for
eign countries where the Company does business may have expiration dates. A certain number of shopping cards, both with andwithout expiration dates, wil
l not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed shopping cards and recognizes revenue for these amounts over shoppingcard historical usage p
eriods based on historical redemption rates. Management periodically reviews and updates its estimates of usage periods and redemptionrates.
Financial and Other Services
The Company recognizes revenue 
from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component ofnet sales in the Company's Consolidat
ed Statements of Income.34

Table of ContentsCost of Sales
Cost of sales includes actua
l product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost oftransportation from th
e Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and importdistribution centers. Cost of s
ales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.Payments from Suppliers
The Company receives consider
ation from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specificprograms such as markdowns, margin p
rotection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost ofsales and are recogniz
ed in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold, except when the payment is a reimbursement ofspecific, incremental and identifia
ble costs.Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Operating, selling, genera
l and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, themajority of the cost of wa
rehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating,selling, general and adm
inistrative expenses. Because the Company does not include most of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments'distribution facili
ties in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may includeall costs related to their di
stribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed 
as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general andadministrative expens
es in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific, incremental and identifiableadvertising costs are r
ecognized as a reduction of advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs were $2.5 billion for fiscal 
2016 and $2.4 billion for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 . Pre-Opening Costs
The cost of start-up act
ivities, including organization costs, related to new store openings, store remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions are expensed asincurred and included in ope
rating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Pre-opening costs totaled$271 million 
, $317 million and $338 million for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities
 of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balancesheet date. Related translati
on adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The income statements of allinternational subsidia
ries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the incomestatements.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifi
cations have been made to previous fiscal year amounts and balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. Thesereclassifications did not im
pact consolidated operating income or net income.Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting St
andards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). 
This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue r ecognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goodsor services to a custome
r at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, FASB issuedASU 2015-14, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Def erral of the Effective Date , which deferred the eff ective date of ASU 2014-09 to reportingperiods beginning after Dec
ember 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company will adopt thisASU on February 1, 2018. Companies may use either a 
full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU. Management is currentlyevaluating this standard, 
including which transition approach to use, and does not expect this ASU to materially impact the Company's consolidated net income,financial position or c
ash flows.In April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03, 
Interest-Imputation of Int erest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Cost . FASB issued ASU 2015-03 to simplify the presentat
ion of debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to present the debt issuance costs as a direct deduction fromthe carrying value of th
e debt liability rather than showing35

Table of Contentsthe debt issuance costs as a d
eferred charge on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginningafter December 15, 2015, with e
arly adoption permitted. Management elected to early adopt this new guidance effective for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016,and has applied the changes r
etrospectively to all periods presented. Adoption of this ASU did not materially impact the Company's consolidated net income,financial position or c
ash flows.In November 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Shee t Classification of Deferred Taxes . This ASU requires the presentation of all deferred tax 
assets and liabilities as non-current in the consolidated balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods withinthose years beginning afte
r December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Management elected to early adopt this new guidance effective for the fourthquarter of fiscal ye
ar 2016 in order to simplify the global close processes. The Company will apply the changes prospectively. Prior periods were notretrospectively adjus
ted to reflect the adoption of this ASU. Adoption of this ASU did not materially impact the Company's consolidated financial position, andhad no impact on the Company's net in
come or cash flows.In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, 
Leases (Topic 842) . FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and co mparability among organizationsby recognizing lease asse
ts and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Certain qualitative and quantitativedisclosures are required,
 as well as a retrospective recognition and measurement of impacted leases. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interimperiods within those years beginn
ing after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating this standard.In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-08, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Prin cipal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting RevenueGross versus Net) 
. The amendments are int ended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agentconsiderations. The effe
ctive date for this ASU is the same as the effective date for ASU 2014-09. Management is currently evaluating this standard.Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share
Basic income per common sha
re from continuing operations attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during therelevant period. Diluted 
income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common sharesoutstanding during the relev
ant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstandingthat were antidilutive and
 not included in the calculation of diluted income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2016 , 2015 
and 2014 . The following table provides a

ck Incentive Plan of 2015 (the "Plan") became effective June 5, 2015 and amended and restated the Company's StockIncentive Plan of 2010. The Plan was est
ablished to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance shares units and other equity compensationawards for which 
210 million shares of common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. TheCompany believes that such awards s
erve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.The Plan's award types are summa
rized as follows:•
Restricted Stock and Performance Shar e Units. Restricted stock awards ar e for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictionsrelated to employmen
t. Performance share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0% to 
150% of the original award amoun t. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and p erformanceshare units may be settl
ed or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value ofrestricted stock awards 
is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share units isdetermined on the date o
f grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and isrecognized over the vest
ing period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance share unitsin fiscal 
2016 , 2015 and 2014 was 7.4% , 7.1% and 6.7% , respectively. •
Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provid e rights to Company stock after a specified service period; generally 50% vest three years from the grant date and the r
emaining 50% vest five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date ofgrant using the stock price d
iscounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period.The expected dividend yield 
is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield usedto determine the fair value of
 restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was 8.7% , 9.5% and 10.3% , respectively. In addition to the Plan, the Company's subs
idiary in the United Kingdom has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over three years. The stock option share-based comp
ensation expense is included in the other line in the table above.37

From time to time, the Comp
any repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. On October 13,2015, the Board of Directors repl
aced the previous $15.0 billion share repurchase progra m, which had approximately $8.6 billion of remaining authoriz ation forshare repurchases as of th
at date, with a new $20.0 billion share repurchase progra m. As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program, the new sharerepurchase program has no exp
iration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. The share repurchases theCompany made during fiscal 2016 wer
e made under both the old and new authorizations. At January 31, 2016 , authorization for $17.5 billion of share repurchases remained under the cur
rent share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.The Company considers several f
actors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage,cost of borrowings, its results of op
erations and the market price of its common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number ofshares repurchased, avera

The Company records and discloses c
ertain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the assetcould be sold in an ordinary tr
ansaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is theamount that would be paid to tr
ansfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liabilitywith the creditor. Assets and l
iabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.The levels of the fair v
alue hierarchy are:•
Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;•
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and•
Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The Company holds derivative inst
ruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair values are the estimated amounts theCompany would receive or pay upon ter
mination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using theincome approach and Level 2 
inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , the notional amounts and fair values of 
these derivatives were as follows:

In addition to assets and li
abilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair valuemeasurements. General
ly, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not record any significantimpairment charges 
to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 or 2015 . Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equ
ivalents and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due totheir short-term maturities.
The Company's long-term debt is a
lso recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing ratefor similar types of bor
rowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , are as follows:

Table of ContentsNote 8. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative fin
ancial instruments for hedging and non-trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchangerates, as well as to main
tain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the Companyto certain risks, such as m
arket and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change. In a hedgingrelationship, the change 
in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.Credit risk related to 
a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. The notional, orcontractual, amount of 
the Company's derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company'sexposure due to credit risk. Cr
edit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewingcredit ratings and requirin
g collateral (generally cash) from the counterparty when appropriate.The Company only enters into deriv
ative transactions with counterparties rated "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. Subsequent toentering into derivat
ive transactions, the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties. In connection with various derivative agreements,including master nett
ing arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of $345 million and $323 million at January 31, 2016 and January 31,2015 
, respectively. The Company re cords cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset. Furthermore, as part ofthe master netting a
rrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company's netderivative liabil
ity position exceeds $150 million with such counterparties. The Comp any had an insignificant amount of cash collateral posted with counterpartiesat 
January 31, 2016 and did not have any cash colla teral posted with counterparties at January 31, 2015 . The Company records cash colla teral it posts withcounterparties as amounts
 receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability.The Company uses derivative fin
ancial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks and, accordingly, thecontractual terms o
f a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that areeffective at meeting the risk red
uction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative financial instrument is recorded using hedgeaccounting, depending on the natu
re of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedgedassets, liabilities or firm commitme
nts through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized inearnings. Any hedge ineffect
iveness is immediately recognized in earnings. The Company's net investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedgesand the ineffective po
rtion has not been, and is not expected to be, significant. Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for whichthe Company has not elected hedg
e accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change.Fair Value Instruments
The Company is a party to rece
ive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The notionalamounts are used to measur
e interest to be paid or received and do not represent the Company's exposure due to credit loss. The Company's interest rate swaps thatreceive fixed-interest rate payments
 and pay variable-interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges. As the specific terms and notional amounts of thederivative instrumen
ts match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, the derivative instruments are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges. Changes in the fairvalues of these derivat
ive instruments are recorded in earnings, but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items, also recorded inearnings, and, accordingly, do not 
impact the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value instruments will mature on dates ranging fromOctober 2020 
to April 2024 . Net Investment Instruments
The Company is a party to cross-cu
rrency interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net investments. The agreements are contracts to exchange fixed-rate payments in one curre
ncy for fixed-rate payments in another currency. All changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in accumulated othercomprehensive income (los
s), offsetting the currency translation adjustment of the related investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensiveincome (loss). These instru
ments will mature on dates ranging from October 2023 to February 2030 . The Company has issued foreign-cur
rency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of net investments of certain of its foreign operations. These foreign-currency-denominated long-term d
ebt issuances are designated and qualify as nonderivative hedging instruments. Accordingly, the foreign currency translation of these debtinstruments is recorded i
n accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investments thatis also recorded in accu
mulated other comprehensive income (loss). At January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , the Company had ¥10 billion and ¥100 billion , respectively, of outstand
ing long-term debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of £2.5 billion at January 31,2016 
and January 31, 2015 that was designated as a hedge o f its net43

Table of Contentsinvestment in the United Kingdom. Th
ese nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to January 2039 . Cash Flow Instruments
The Company wa
s a party to receive variable-rate, pay fixed-rate interest rate swaps that matured in July 2015 . The Company used these interest rate swaps tohedge the interest ra
te risk of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of interest expense risk. Amounts reported inaccumulated other comprehensi
ve income (loss) related to these derivatives were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings asinterest was expensed for th
e Company's variable-rate debt, converting the variable-rate interest expense into fixed-rate interest expense.The Company is also a party to re
ceive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecastedpayments of principal and 
interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments onthe non-U.S. denominated debt. The ef
fective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk isrecorded in accumulated other
 comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transactionaffects earnings. The he
dged items are recognized foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are re-measured at spot exchange rates each period, and theassessment of effect
iveness (and measurement of any ineffectiveness) is based on total changes in the related derivative's cash flows. As a result, the amountreclassified into earnings eac
h period includes an amount that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that re-measurement and the adjustment toearnings for the period's a
llocable portion of the initial spot-forward difference associated with the hedging instrument. These cash flow instruments will mature ondates ranging from 
April 2022 to March 2034 . Financial Statement Presentat
ionAlthough subject to master ne
tting arrangements, the Company does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.Derivative instruments wi
th an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based onmaturity date, and those h
edging instruments with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note7 for the net presentat
ion of the Company's derivative instruments.The Company's derivative instru

econciliationThe Company's effective inco

ing structures and certain U.S. tax credits as further discussed in the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section of the Company'ssignificant accounting po
licies in Note 1. The Company's non-U.S. income is generally subject to local country tax rates that are below the 35% U.S. statutory taxrate. Certain non-U.S. earnings hav

U.S. income taxes have not been provid

$23.3 billion as of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest these amounts outside of the U.S. However, ifany portion were to be distribu
ted, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by foreign income taxes paid on those earnings. Determination of the unrecognizeddeferred tax liabi
lity related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with its hypothetical calculation. The Company providesdeferred or current 
income taxes on earnings of international subsidiaries in the period that the Company determines it will remit those earnings.Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances
At 
January 31, 2016 , the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately $5.3 billion . Of these carryforwards, approximately 
$3.0 billion will expire, if not util ized, in various years through 2036 . The remaining carryfo rwards have no expiration. At January 31, 2016 , the Company had foreign tax credi
t carryforwards of $1.8 billion , which will expire in various ye ars through 2026 , if not utilized. The recoverability of 
these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, includingtaxable income in prior carry
back years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To theextent management does no
t consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, a valuation allowance is established. If a valuation allowancehas been established and man
agement subsequently determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance isreleased.

Table of ContentsThe Company had valuation allowanc
es recorded of approximately $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, on defer red tax assets associatedprimarily with net oper
ating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Thenet activity in the valuatio
n allowance during fiscal 2016 related to releases arising from  the use of deferred tax assets, changes in judgment regarding the futurerealization of deferred tax asset
s, increases from certain net operating losses and deductible temporary differences arising in fiscal 2016 , decreases due to operating loss expiratio
ns and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred taxassets will be fully rea
lized.Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncerta
in tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more likely than not probabilitythat the uncertain t
ax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.As of 
January 31, 2016 and 2015 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $607 million and $838 million , respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax b
enefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $522 million and $763 million for January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
A reconciliation of unre
cognized tax benefits from continuing operations was as follows: 
Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)

$ 607  $838  $763 The Company classifies inte
rest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses,respectively. During fisc
al 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company recognized inte rest and penalty expense (benefit) related to uncertain tax positions of $5 million , $18 million 
and $(7) million , respectively. As of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , accrued interest r elated to uncertain tax positions of $60 million and $57 million , respectively, was record
ed in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company did not have any accrued penalties recorded for income taxes as ofJanuary 31, 2016 
or 2015 . During the next twelve months, it 
is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by between $50 million and $150 million, either because the t
ax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits asexpeditiously as possible. As a resu
lt of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelvemonths. The Company does not expect any ch
ange to have a significant impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company remains subject to 
income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2013 through 2016 . The Company also remains subject to income tax exami
nations for international income taxes for fiscal 2000 through 2016 , and for U.S. state and local inco me taxes generally for the fiscalyears ended 
2008 through 2016 . Note 10. Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of 
legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflectedin the Company's Consolidated Financia
l Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore anaccrual has not been mad
e. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter intodiscussions regardin
g settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company'sshareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the m
atters, or groups of related matters, discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in theaggregate, may result 
in a liability material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.Wage-and-Hour Class Action: 
The Company is a defendant in Braun/Hummel v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , a class-action lawsuit commenced in March 2002 in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsy
lvania. The plaintiffs allege that the Company failed to pay class members for all hours worked and prevented classmembers from taking th
eir full meal and rest breaks. On October 13, 2006 , a jury awarded back-pay dam ages to the plaintiffs of approximately $78 million on their claims for of
f-the-clock work and missed rest breaks. The jury found in favor of the Company on the plaintiffs' meal-period claims.47

Table of ContentsOn 
November 14, 2007 , the trial judge ente red a final judgment in the approximate amount of $188 million , which included the jury's back-p ay award plusstatutory penalties, pr
ejudgment interest and attorneys' fees. By operation of law, post-judgment interest accrues on the judgment amount at the rate of six percent per annum from the date o
f entry of the judgment, which was November 14, 2007 , until the judgment is paid, un less the judgment is set aside on appeal. OnDecember 7, 2007 
, the Company filed its Notice o f Appeal. On June 10, 2011 , the Pennsylvania Superior Court of Appea ls issued an opinion upholding the trialcourt's certifica
tion of the class, the jury's back pay award, and the awards of statutory penalties and prejudgment interest, but reversing the award of attorneys'fees. On 
September 9, 2011 , the Company filed a Petition for Allowance of Appeal with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. On July 2, 2012 , the Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted the Company's Pet
ition. On December 15, 2014, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued its opinion affirming the Superior Court ofAppeals' decision. At that tim
e, the Company recorded expenses of $249 million for the judgment amount and pos t-judgment interest incurred to date. TheCompany will continue to accru
e for the post-judgment interest until final resolution. However, the Company continues to believe it has substantial factual andlegal defenses to the c
laims at issue, and, on March 13, 2015, the Company filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 20, 2015,the plaintiffs fil
ed their response in opposition and on May 4, 2015, the Company filed its reply brief.ASDA Equal Value Claims: 
ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a def endant in over 7,000 "equal value" claims that are proceeding before an Employ
ment Tribunal in Manchester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom ("UK") on behalf of current and former ASDAstore employees, who allege 
that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demandsof their jobs to that of m
ale employees working in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positionsis not objectively justi
fied. Claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and those higherwage rates on a prospective b
asis as part of these equal value proceedings. ASDA believes that further claims may be asserted in the near future. On March 23,2015, ASDA asked the Employment Tribunal to stay 
all proceedings, contending that the High Court, which is the superior first instance civil court in the UK thatis headquartered in the Roya
l Courts of Justice in the City of London, is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these claims. On March 23, 2015,ASDA also asked the Employment Tribunal to "s
trike out" substantially all of the claims for failing to comply with Employment Tribunal rules. On July 23, 2015,the Employment Tribunal den
ied ASDA's requests to stay all proceedings and to "strike out" substantially all of the claims. On September 2, 2015, ASDA filed aNotice of Appeal with the Employm
ent Appeal Tribunal seeking to appeal both rulings. On October 14, 2015, the Employment Appeal Tribunal denied ASDA'srequests for an appeal. Following 
additional argument and proceedings, the issue of "strike out" and the scope of Employment Tribunal Rules are subject of furtherappellate review by the E
mployment Appeal Tribunal but the request to appeal the stay issue was denied by the Employment Appeal Tribunal. On March 8, 2016,ASDA filed a notice of appeal with th
e Court of Appeals seeking to appeal the Employment Appeal Tribunal's decision to disallow an appeal of the stay issue. Atpresent, the Company cannot pred
ict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise fromthese proceedings. The Company bel
ieves it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously.48

Table of ContentsFCPA Investigation and Related Matters
The Audit Committee (the "Audit Com
mittee") of the Board of Directors of the Company, which is composed solely of independent directors, is conducting aninternal investigat
ion into, among other things, alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other alleged crimes or misconduct inconnection with foreign subsidi
aries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/ormisconduct were appropria
tely handled by the Company. The Audit Committee and the Company have engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms andother advisors who are assisting 
in the on-going investigation of these matters.The Company is also conducting a volunt
ary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance. The Company is engagedin strengthening its global 
anti-corruption compliance program through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures.  In November 2011, the Companyvoluntarily disclosed tha
t investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Since theimplementation of th
e global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the Audit Committee and the Company have identified or been madeaware of additional al
legations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. When such allegations are reported or identified, the Audit Committee and theCompany, together with their th
ird party advisors, conduct inquiries and when warranted based on those inquiries, open investigations. Inquiries or investigationsregarding allegations o
f potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates, including, but not limitedto, Brazil, China and India.
The Company has been informed by the DOJ and th
e SEC that it is also the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA. TheCompany is cooperating with the inv
estigations by the DOJ and the SEC. A number of federal and loc al government agencies in Mexico have also initiatedinvestigations of these m
atters. Walmex is cooperating with the Mexican governmental agencies conducting these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating tothe matters under inves
tigation have been filed by several of the Company's shareholders against it, certain of its current directors, certain of its former directors,certain of its current and f
ormer officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers.The Company could be exposed to a vari
ety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. There could be one or more enforcement actions inrespect of the matt
ers that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments,settlements, fines, pen
alties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The shareholder lawsuits mayresult in judgments agains
t the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. The Company cannot predict at this time theoutcome or impact of th
e government investigations, the shareholder lawsuits, or its own internal investigations and review. In addition, the Company has incurredand expects to continue to in
cur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connectionwith the government investig
ations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations. These costs will be expensed asincurred. For the fiscal y
ears ended January 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company incurred the fol lowing third-party expenses in connection with the FCPAinvestigation and rela
ted matters:

 $126  $173  $282 These matters may require the
 involvement of certain members of the Company's senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devoteto other matters re
lating to the business. The Company expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles frommedia publications on thes
e matters, which could impact the perc eption among certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen.    The Company's process of assessing and respond
ing to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues. While the Company believes that itis probable that it will 
incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations, the Company cannotreasonably estimate 
any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Although the Company does not presently believe that these matters will have amaterial adverse 
effect on its business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, the Company can provide no assurance that these matters will not bematerial to its busin
ess in the future.49

inancial ReportingThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
We have audited Wal-M
art Stores, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Wal-MartStores, Inc.'s management is 
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financia
l reporting included in the accompanying "Management's Report to Our Shareholders." Our responsibility is to express an opinion on theCompany's internal control ove
r financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that weplan and perform the au
dit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an und
erstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluatingthe design and operating ef
fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company's internal control ov
er financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.In our opinion, Wal-
Mart Stores, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 , based on the COSO criteria.
