Customers
Our microprocessor customers consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), large public cloud service providers, original design
manufacturers (ODMs), system integrators and independent distributors in both domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and/or
manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Customers of our microprocessor products also include
online and brick and mortar retailers. Our graphics product customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs).
Customers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as
well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards. Our FPGA and Adaptive SOC products are
sold to customers in a very wide range of markets such as Aerospace and Defense, Test and Measurement, Industrial, Automotive, Consumers, Broadcast,
Communication Infrastructure and Data Center. For these products we either sell directly to our customers or through a network of distributors and OEM
partners. We are also developing a network of Value Added Resellers (VARs) and Integrated Solution Vendors (ISVs) for our Alveo products.
We work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our
customers’ needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our
products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers’ time-to-market and fosters relationships that
encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.

Table of Contents
We also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring
engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products.
One customer accounted for 16% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Sales to this customer consisted of sales of products
from our Gaming segment. A loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.
Original Equipment Manufacturers
We focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and selected global and local system integrators, who target commercial
and consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners’ business; however, we are
increasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we
have increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and services solutions into Enterprise, high
performance computing (HPC) and Cloud Service Provider Customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers
and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.
Third-Party Distributors
Our authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and OEMs, ODMs, and other customers. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products,
and may include products from other manufacturers that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most
instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide certain return rights with respect to any
product that we have removed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain
standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited product returns.
Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators
We offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system
integrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell
directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles
and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their
customers.
Competition in Data Center Segment
In Data Center, we compete against Intel Corporation (Intel) with our FPGA, Adaptive SoC, CPU and DPU server products and NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA)
with our CPU, GPU and DPU server products. A variety of companies provide or have developed ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based
designs are being used in the server market, which could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem.
Competition in Client Segment
The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our primary competitor in the supply of CPUs is Intel. A variety of companies provide or have
developed ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based designs are being used in the PC market, which could lead to further growth and
development of the ARM ecosystem.

Competition in Gaming Segment
In the graphics market, our principal competitor in the supply of discrete graphics is NVIDIA who is the market share leader. Intel also manufactures and sells
embedded graphics processors and integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets. Also, Intel has developed their own gaming-focused discrete GPUs and has
entered the market. Other competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics and integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets. Some of our competitors are
smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to address the growing complexity of
graphics processors and the associated research and development costs. With respect to integrated graphics, higher unit shipments of our APUs and Intel’s
integrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for
notebooks, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users at a lower cost. We are the market share leader in semi-
custom game console products, where graphics performance is critical.
Competition in Embedded Segment
We expect continued competition from our primary FPGA competitors such as Intel, Lattice Semiconductor Corporation and Microsemi Corporation (Microsemi,
acquired by Microchip), from ASSP vendors such as Broadcom Corporation, Marvell Technology Group, Ltd., Analog Devices, Texas Instruments Incorporated
and NXP Semiconductors N.V., and from NVIDIA. In addition, we expect continued competition from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the
inception of FPGAs. Other competitors include manufacturers of:
•high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures;
•high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;
•ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic;
•high-speed, low-density complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs);
•high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) devices;
•products with embedded processors;
•products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers;
•discrete general-purpose GPUs targeting data center and automotive applications; and
•other new or emerging programmable logic products.
Research and Development
We focus our research and development (R&D) activities on designing and developing products. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of
processors (CPU and GPU), FPGAs and Adaptive SoCs, accelerators (adaptive, graphics and DPU), System on Modules (SOMs) and SmartNICs and
associated software. We focus on designing new ICs with improved performance and performance-per-watt in advanced semiconductor manufacturing
processes, the design of logic and interface IP, advanced packaging technologies, and heterogeneous integration technologies. We also focus on software as
part of the development of our products, including design automation tools for hardware, embedded software, optimized software tools and libraries that extend
the reach of our platforms to software and AI developers. Through our R&D efforts, we were able to introduce a number of new products and enhance our IP
core offerings and software.
We also work with industry leaders on process technology, design tools, intellectual property, software and other industry consortia to conduct early-stage
research and development. We are also actively contributing to numerous industry open-source software initiatives across a broad range of technologies. We
conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering
teams located in various countries who undertake specific activities at the direction of our U.S. headquarters.
Manufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities
Third-Party Wafer Foundry Facilities
We have foundry arrangements with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of wafers for our HPC, FPGA and
Adaptive SoC products.
We are also a party to a Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF), with respect to wafer purchases for our HPC products at the 12
nm and 14 nm technology nodes.
10
Table of Contents
Additionally, we purchase wafers from United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.
Other Third-Party Manufacturers
We outsource board-level graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers.
Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities
Wafers for our products are either sorted by the foundry or delivered by the foundry to our assembly, test, mark and packaging (ATMP) partners or
subcontractors located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products. We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively,
the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The ATMP JVs, Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. (SPIL) and King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC)
provide ATMP services for our products.
Intellectual Property and Licensing
We rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. Intellectual
property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and mask work rights. As of December 31, 2022, we had
approximately 8,200 patents in the United States and approximately 2,200 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed
corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. Including United States and foreign matters, we have approximately 19,800 patent matters worldwide
consisting of approximately 13,200 issued patents and 6,600 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States
and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be
material to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other
companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. We have acquired various licenses from external parties to
certain technologies that are implemented in our products, including our IP cores and devices. These licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell
our products. We have also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design
tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which our customers depend.
Backlog
Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Although such orders or
agreements may provide visibility into future quarters, they may not necessarily be indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period as some of these orders
or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty. With respect to our semi-custom SoC products our orders and agreements are more stringent
resulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter.
Seasonality
Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the
year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 25,000 employees in our global workforce. We believe we are at our best when our culture of innovation,
creative minds and people from all kinds of backgrounds work together in an engaging and open environment. Areas of focus for us include the following:
Mission, Culture, and Engagement
Our History - Founded in 1969 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the AMD journey began with dozens of employees focused on leading-edge semiconductor
products. From those modest beginnings, we have grown into a global company achieving many important industry firsts along the way. Today, we develop
high-performance and adaptive computing to solve some of the world’s toughest and most interesting challenges.
Our Vision - High performance and adaptive computing is transforming our lives.
11
Table of Contents
Our Mission - Build great products that accelerate next-generation computing experiences. Our employees are driven by this vision and mission. Innovation
occurs when creative minds and diverse perspectives from all over the world work together. This is the foundation of our unique culture and the reason why our
employees are among the most engaged in our industry.
We conduct a confidential annual survey of our global workforce to measure our culture, engagement, and manager quality. The results are reviewed by our
Board of Directors and acted upon by our senior leadership team and individual managers at every level. Results from our 2022 survey reported scores that
continued to be among the very best for global companies in the technology industry. Our employees described our culture as inclusive, innovative, open, and
respectful, and rated the quality of our managers among the top 10% of our technology industry peers.
Diversity, Belonging and Inclusion
Our diverse and inclusive workforce encourages employees to share their opinions and different perspectives. We believe that building a diverse talent pipeline,
encouraging a culture of respect and belonging, and increasing inclusion of unique and underrepresented voices makes our Company stronger. Our Employee
Resource Groups encourage employee engagement and play an important role in our culture. In 2022, we were recognized for the sixth consecutive year by
the Human Rights Campaign Foundation as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ equality and were included in Bloomberg’s Gender Equality Index for the fourth
consecutive year.
We are focused on hiring and developing underrepresented groups and women leaders. We are proud to be led by a highly regarded CEO who has won many
esteemed awards for her business and leadership prowess. In 2022, Dr. Lisa Su was listed among “Fortune’s Most Powerful Women”. In the last two years, she
also received the “Woman Innovation Award” from the Global Semiconductor Alliance and was listed among Barron’s World’s Best CEOs and Forbes’ World’s
Most Powerful Women. In addition, Dr. Su continues to support President Biden’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.
Total Rewards
We invest in our workforce by offering competitive salaries, incentives, and benefits to ensure that we continue to attract and retain the industry’s best and
brightest. Our rewards are guided by employees’ preferences and the market for talent. We have a strong pay for performance culture that we believe drives
superior results. Our employees have benefited from our robust financial results with very strong short-term and long-term incentives. Our rewards programs
enabled us to attract, retain and motivate our workforce, including approximately 10,000 new AMDers who were added to the company through acquisitions and
direct hiring during fiscal year 2022.
Development
We offer our employees opportunities to advance their careers at the Company and the majority of our new leaders are promoted from within. We are focused
on leadership progression and encourage our employees to take advantage of new opportunities. Our manager and leadership development programs are
highly rated, and we provide specialized development programs for our employees.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those
relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations
making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become
more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on
the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. A number of jurisdictions including
the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on
ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits.
12
Table of Contents
Certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund
Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal
or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator
did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange
for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for
cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for
three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater
from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were
commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.
In 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have
entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to
assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional
costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement
agreements.
To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3.9
million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts
cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. We believe that any amount in addition to what has already been accrued would not be
material.

Economic and Strategic Risks
Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively on a
level playing field.
Intel Corporation (Intel) has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources
enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do
business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and
adversely affected our margins and profitability.
Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a
result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and
to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets,
graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally,
Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such
standards.
As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices, including rebating and allocation
strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and
merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards,
and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS)
suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the
Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers.
Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and
development than we do. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other
technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies,
or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for
microprocessor products.
Intel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our
competitors in the graphics market, such as NVIDIA Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information or restricting
access to external companies. Also, Intel has developed and released their own high-end discrete GPUs, including gaming focused discrete GPUs. We also
compete with Intel in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and Adaptive SoC products. Intel’s position in the microprocessor, and integrated graphics
chipset markets, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs, and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies
could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.
We experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the
PC supply chain in the second half of 2022. Uncertain global economic conditions have and may in the future adversely impact our business. Uncertainty in the
worldwide economic environment or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as inflation, interest rates or recession, may negatively impact
consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. In addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential
future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally, if our customers
are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts
receivable that they owe us. The risk related to our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small
number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for
16
Table of Contents
our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely
impacting our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings
or private or public sales of debt or equity securities.
The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to
materially adversely affect, our business in the future.
The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change,
wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred
substantial losses in previous downturns, due to substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the
semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end-user products (such as PCs) that incorporate our products; and excess inventory levels.
Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future.
Global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases,
which negatively impacted demand for our products. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. In
the second half of 2022, we experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory
correction actions across the PC supply chain.
The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be
successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local
relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material
adverse effect on us.
The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our
products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future.
Our Client segment revenue is focused on the consumer desktop and notebook PC segments, which in the second half of 2022 experienced a decline as a
result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. In the past, revenues from the Client and
Gaming segments have experienced a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition and
changes in replacement cycles. The success of our semi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and
consumer market conditions, including the success of the Sony PlayStation® 5, Microsoft® Xbox Series S and Microsoft® Xbox Series X game console
systems and next generation consoles for Sony and Microsoft, worldwide. In addition, the GPU market has at times seen elevated demand due to the
application of GPU products to cryptocurrency mining. For example, our GPU revenue has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining
market. Demand for cryptocurrency has changed and is likely to continue to change quickly. For example, China has banned such activities, and corresponding
interest in mining of such currencies are subject to significant fluctuations. Alternatively, countries have created and may continue to create their own
cryptocurrencies or equivalents that could also impact interest in mining. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency
mining market, our GPU business could be materially adversely affected.
The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.
We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account
for a significant part of our revenue in the future. If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers materially
reduces its operations or its demand for our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.TM TM

The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused government authorities to implement numerous public health measures, including at various times vaccination and testing
requirements and recordkeeping, quarantines, business closures, travel bans, and restrictions related to social gathering and mobility, to contain the virus.
Various state and federal rules are issued and updated on an ongoing basis, at times in conflict and/or with minimal notice. We have experienced and expect to
continue to experience disruptions to our business as these changing measures have, and will continue to have, an effect on our business operations and
practices.
While our employees gradually return to office, we continue to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in
response to COVID-19. Although some public health measures have eased, our efforts to reopen our offices safely may not be successful and could expose
our employees to health risks. It is uncertain as to when all health measures put in place to attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19 will be lifted. If there are
further waves of the virus, health measures may be reimplemented and we may need to further limit operations or modify our business practices in a manner
that may impact our business. If our employees are not able to perform their job duties due to self-isolation, quarantine, lockdown measures, unavailability of
COVID 19 tests, travel restrictions or illness, a reluctance or refusal to vaccinate, or are unable to perform them as efficiently at home for an extended period of
time, we may not be able to meet our product schedules, roadmaps and customer commitments and we may experience an overall lower productivity of our
workforce. Even when COVID-19 health measures are lifted or modified, our employees’ ability or willingness to return to work may delay the return of our full
workforce and the resumption of normal business operations.
COVID-19 continues to impact the global supply chain causing disruptions to service providers, logistics and the flow and availability of supplies and products.
We have experienced some disruptions to parts of our supply chain as a result of COVID-19 and we adjust our supply chain requirements based on changing
customer needs and demands. We have taken efforts to maintain a stable supply of materials to meet our production requirements through long-term purchase
commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates at a
reasonable cost, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also assess our product schedules and roadmaps to make any adjustments
that may be necessary to support remote working requirements and address the geographic and market demand shifts caused by COVID-19. If the supply of
our products to customers is delayed, reduced or canceled due to disruptions encountered by our third-party manufacturers, back-end manufacturers,
warehouses, partners, suppliers or vendors as a result of facility closures, border and port restrictions or closures, transportation delays, lockdown measures,
labor shortages or workforce mobility limitations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
COVID-19 has in the short-term and may in the long-term adversely impact the global economy, creating uncertainty and potentially leading to an economic
downturn. This could negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone or cancel purchases, or delay paying or default
on payment of outstanding amounts due to us, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Even in times of strong demand for our products, the
worldwide economic environment remains uncertain due to COVID-19 and such demand may not be sustainable over the longer term.
COVID-19 has also led to a disruption and volatility in the global capital and financial markets. While we believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments along with our Revolving Credit Agreement and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, and
purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond, to the extent we may require additional funding to finance our operations and capital
expenditures and such funding may not be available to us as a result of contracting capital and financial markets resulting from COVID-19, it may have an
adverse effect on our business.
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are unpredictable and highly uncertain,
including the continued spread, duration and severity of the outbreak, the appearances of new variants of COVID-19, the breadth and duration of business
disruptions related to COVID-19, the availability and distribution of effective treatments and vaccines, and public health measures and actions taken throughout
the world to contain COVID-19. The prolonged effect of COVID-19 could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.
The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving
revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality, product features
and capabilities (including enabling state-of-the-art visual and virtual reality (VR) experiences), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life),
reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry
standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of software design tools, completeness of applicable software
solutions, security and stability, brand recognition and availability.
We expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors
of products that may provide better performance/experience or that may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive. We
may also face aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. In addition, our competitors have significant marketing and
sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in a declining market, leading to lower prices and margins. Some competitors may have
greater access or rights to complementary technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. For instance, with our APU products
and other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due
to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for
our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, Intel is expanding its position in integrated graphics for the
PC market with high-end discrete graphics solutions for a broad range of computing segments, which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these
computing segments. We also face competition from companies that use competing computing architectures and platforms like the ARM architecture.
Increased adoption of ARM-based semiconductor designs could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem.
In addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging
technologies. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these
new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. Furthermore, we may face competition from some of our
customers who internally develop the same products as us. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to
invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. Also, the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers and
acquisitions over the last number of years. Further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers, customers and
partners in the industry.
Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.
The profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. A large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the
quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly
results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. For example,
historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product
transitions could impact these trends. Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control.
If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade
secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses.
We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and
common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our
technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or
issued to us could be challenged, invalidated, expire, or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us.
19
Table of Contents
Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is
advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or
design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a
cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad, our
technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected.
Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.
We have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign
currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge
a portion of our foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using
projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate
exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our
product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or
decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales
of our products.
Operational and Technology Risks
We rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive
technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.
We utilize third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited
(TSMC) for the production of all wafers for microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes, and we rely primarily on
GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) for wafers for microprocessor and GPU products manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm. We also utilize TSMC,
United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for our integrated circuits (IC) in the form of programmable logic devices. We
also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack (ATMP) our products. Our third-party package assembly partners are responsible for
packaging technology used to fabricate our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure
adequate product supply to respond to customer demand.
We cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing
requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the reduced quantities of
affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition.
In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a
material adverse effect on our business. For example, if TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nm or smaller
nodes and our newest IC products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a
purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an
existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to
produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices.
The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize
capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require onerous prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
20
Table of Contents
Other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules, yield, cycle times, quality assurance,
price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several subcontractors, and limited
ability to manage inventory and parts. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers (or their subcontractors) suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits
under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to
secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social, economic or political
circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to
meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.
If we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer
performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party
manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those manufacturers, we may be unable to timely secure an alternative supply for any specific
product. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business.
We are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF and this agreement is
in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the Amendment).
Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer
purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference
between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD was
obligated in 2022 and is obligated in 2023 to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments
and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer
requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher
inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity
allocation obligations, we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are
provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet
customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
If essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially
adversely affected.
We may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations
depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely
delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical
complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment
and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also
depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU
products. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors
used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of suppliers. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of
equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in
equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term
purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers. If the delivery of such supply is delayed or does not occur for any reason, it
could materially impact our ability to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer
demand could result in excess inventory and an increase in our production costs, particularly since we have prepayment arrangements with certain suppliers.
21
Table of Contents
Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one
equipment or materials supplier for another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or
other factors. Also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased
demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of
suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party
manufacturers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.
Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results.
Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of product design, process technology and packaging technology, which is typically proprietary to the
manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, packaging technology failures, process technology failures or a combination of some or all of
these. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party manufacturers experience
manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or we may experience
product delivery delays. We cannot be certain that our third-party manufacturers will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process
or packaging technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new
technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when our third-party manufacturers are implementing new process or packaging
technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could
have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently
focusing our 7 nm and lower product microprocessor and GPU portfolio on TSMC’s processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7
nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, we rely on TSMC,
UMC and our other foundries to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes for our IC products. Therefore, the foundries, particularly TSMC which
manufactures our newest IC products, must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers
at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner.
Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate
our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our
business.
The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that
provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions.
Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that
provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving
industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis, are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target
markets. As consumers have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be
negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative
products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies
that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business
accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products.
Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement
new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and
technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur
unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing
investments in new products and
22
Table of Contents
technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.
Delays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers’ product design windows or, in some cases, breach
contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products,
they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a
customer’s system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market
share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers’ platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or
if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a
cycle in the demand of end-users, which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new
features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. The introduction
of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new
products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time,
our business could be materially adversely affected.
Our revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customers’ products
and the success of those products.
The revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and
development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate
revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers’ desire to pursue the
project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers’ products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is
directly related to sales of the third-party’s products and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of
these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-
custom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected.
Our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us.
The products that we sell are complex and have been and may in the future be subject to security vulnerabilities that could result in, among other things, the
loss, corruption, theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issues. Our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease
performance, be only partially effective or not successful at all. We may depend on vendors to create mitigations to their technology that we incorporate into our
products and they may delay or decline to make such mitigations. We may also depend on third parties, such as customers and end users, to deploy our
mitigations alone or as part of their own mitigations, and they may delay, decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. Our relationships with our
customers could be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our products, reduce or delay future purchases of our products, or use
competing products. Any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. We have and may in the future be subject to claims and
litigation related to security vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity, damage to our brand
and reputation, and could materially harm our business or financial results.
IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to
remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation and operations.
In the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (IT) assets, and also may maintain sensitive information on our
business partners’ and third-party providers’ IT assets, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our
business and that of our customers and business partners. The White House, SEC and other regulators have also increased their focus on companies’
cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Maintaining the security of this information is important to our business and reputation. AMD and companies like AMD
and our vendors and customers have been increasingly subject to cybersecurity attempts and threats. The increased prevalence of work-from-home
arrangements at AMD
23
Table of Contents
and our providers has presented additional operational risks and cybersecurity attack vectors to our IT systems. These threats can come from a variety of
sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be
custom-crafted against our information systems. Cyber threats have and may come into our network through malicious code that is added to widely available
open-source software, compromised commercial software or security vulnerabilities in our products or those of a third party that are being used by attackers
prior to mitigations being put in place, such as zero-day attacks. Cyber-attacks have and may come into our IT system through the compromise of our users’
access credentials. Users’ access credentials can be compromised by phishing, vishing, smishing, multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompt bombing, hacking,
or other social engineering, cybersecurity, or theft activities. Cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect, defend against
or prevent and have and may cause a disruption to our business. Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners,
and third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions.
It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. It also may not be possible to determine the root
cause of such incidents or mitigate quickly enough to stop an attack. These data breaches and any unauthorized access, misuse or disclosure of our
information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information or personally identifiable information.
Cyber-attacks on us or our customers, business partners or third-party providers could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product
development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also
subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business.
We also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers and consumers. The confidentiality and integrity of our worker and
consumer data is important to our business and our workers and consumers have a high expectation that we adequately protect their personal information. In
addition, many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation
and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and failure to comply or a breach of personally identifiable information could result in sanctions or other actions by the
governments or litigation by other entities.
We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to upgrading
application, computer, and network security components; training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls; investigating, responding to and
remediating any data security breach, and addressing any related litigation; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with external regulations.
We often partner with third-party providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third parties based on the
scope of the services provided to us. We also provide sensitive information to vendors, customers and contractors. If these third parties fail to adopt or adhere
to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers’ data and sensitive information may be improperly accessed, used
or disclosed.
A breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could
materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other
confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating
results.
We may encounter difficulties in upgrading and operating our new enterprise resource planning system, which could materially adversely affect us.
We are currently upgrading our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to help us manage our operations and financial reporting. The adoption of a new
ERP system is a major undertaking and poses several challenges, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. Costs and risks
inherent in the conversion to our upgraded and new system may include disruptions to business continuity, difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls,
administrative and technical problems, interruptions or delays in sales processes, expenditure overruns, and data migration issues. If we do not properly
address or mitigate these issues it could result in increased costs and the diversion of management’s attention and resources, negatively impacting our
operating results and ability to effectively manage our business. Moreover, once our ERP system is upgraded, it may not operate as we expect it to
24
Table of Contents
and cause disruption to our operations. There are no assurances that our new ERP system will be successfully implemented and the failure to do so could have
a material adverse effect on our business.
Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.
We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum
purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products
more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers’ estimates of demand for their
products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our
ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our
forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. For instance, we have experienced and
continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase
production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer
demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid
obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. For example, in the second
half of 2022, we experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction
actions across the PC supply chain. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or
overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and
an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving certain components to build their products, which
in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing
matched component sets to build their products.
Excess or obsolete inventory have and may in the future result in write-downs of the value of our inventory. For example, in the third quarter of 2022, we
recorded certain charges primarily for inventory, pricing and related reserves in the Gaming and Client segments. Other factors that may result in excess or
obsolete inventory include, a reduction in the average selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for
our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer
requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our
competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.
Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner includes use of third-party intellectual property.
In the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software
and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet
customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or
development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality
or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer
demands, or laws are adopted that affect our use of third party intellectual property in certain regions or products, our business could be materially adversely
affected.
We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform
components to support our business and products.
We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g., BIOS, operating systems,
drivers), memory and other components that we use to design, support and sell, and our customers utilize to support and/or use our product offerings. We also
rely on our AIB partners to support our products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to
work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components
cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production
25
Table of Contents
of current or future products that are based on, utilized in, or support our products, or laws are adopted that result in the same, our business could be materially
adversely affected.
If we lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products,
our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.
Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on
or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating
system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on
independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating
systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products,
independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs
with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we
otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.
Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.
We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for
convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer
our competitors’ products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant
distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors’
products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be
materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/or AIB partners, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer
appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.
Additionally, distributors and AIB partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their
inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12
months older than the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of
product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the
price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would
decline.
Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or
interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.
We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these
processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our
business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems will continually evolve
and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on
management time.
These changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-
party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be
no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems, and
those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond
our control including catastrophic events,
26
Table of Contents
power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, insider threat attacks, unauthorized system or data modifications, data
breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business.
In addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers
and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. However, these practices can also result in a more distributed
IT environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability and administrative
requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements,
our business would be materially adversely affected.
If our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected.
Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such
compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely
affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.
Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are
released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial
shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, loss of revenue,
writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against
litigation related to defective products or related liabilities, including property damage, personal injury, damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data
or intangible property, and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the
defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially
adversely affect our business.
We could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury, whether tangible or
intangible. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the
actions of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a
material adverse effect on our business.
If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be
materially adversely affected.
Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly,
we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth
adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly
important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, geographic requirements, and specific time-frames in
which they require delivery of these products. If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations,
our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
27
Table of Contents
We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management
and information technology support services.
We rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished
products among our facilities, to our third-party manufacturers and to our customers. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information
technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage
administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their
respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to
our customers could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which
case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition
is not executed appropriately.
Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us.
We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our
authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray market.” Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it
difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily
discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impacts our margins. In addition, our inability to control gray
market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a
risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used
products represented as new.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
Government actions and regulations such as export regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures may limit our ability to export our products
to certain customers.
We have equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity.
In June 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the United States Department of Commerce added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List,
including THATIC and the THATIC JV. Since that time, the United States administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy, including policies
with respect to China and Russia. Specifically, United States-China trade relations remain uncertain as the United States continues to add more Chinese
companies to the Entity List and more regulations targeted to advanced computing, semiconductor manufacturing, and AI. Further, the United States and other
countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus or the DNR or LNR regions of
Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. BIS has issued new requirements that prevent us from shipping MI250 and MI250X integrated circuits to China and
Russia without a license. BIS may possibly issue new licensing requirements and regulatory controls in the future. A significant trade disruption or the
establishment or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions could result in lost sales adversely impacting our reputation and business.
There is also a possibility of future tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our products or on our
customers by the United States, China or other countries that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Export control restrictions may adversely
impact the ability of our research and development teams located outside of the United States from executing our product roadmaps in a timely manner or at
all.
We may, from time to time, receive technical data from third parties that is subject to the International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are
administered by the U.S. Department of State. EAR and ITAR govern the export and re-export of certain AMD products, including FPGAs, and the transfer of
related technologies, whether in the U.S. or abroad, and the provision of services. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security
infrastructure to meet EAR and ITAR requirements. An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when they will be granted, increases the
difficulties of forecasting shipments. In addition, security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as
stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and/or operating results.

Table of Contents
If we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in
future periods. Each quarter, we consider both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely
than not to be realized. If we determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense in the period in which
this determination is made which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, a significant amount of our deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits which remain under a valuation allowance could be
subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The limitations could
reduce our ability to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes.
Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities, and exposure to greater-than-anticipated income tax liabilities as a result of changes in tax rules
and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, or unfavorable assessments from tax audits, any of which could affect our
effective tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations.
We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we
conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as
new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Any changes to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our tax
obligations and effective tax rate. Our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, changes to our corporate operating
structure, intercompany arrangements, and tax planning strategies.
Our income tax expense is computed based on tax rates at the time of the respective financial period. Our future effective tax rates, financial condition and
results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in the tax rules and
regulations or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
assets.
In addition, we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes
resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result
from the current examinations. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our
effective tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations.
In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax, indirect tax, or other tax determination is
uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits or litigation will not be
materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment
or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, tax provisions and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial
damages or prohibit us from selling our products.
From time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions, as described in Note 17 - Contingencies of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial
Statements. For example, we have been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. Our products are purchased by
and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims. On
occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this
alleged exposure caused harm. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. It is possible that if a claim is
successfully asserted against us, it could result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business.

With respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us and/or
against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the
intellectual property rights of others, improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. If
any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties’ intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up
to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of
our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our
products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an
injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to
redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their
merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our
intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded.
Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our
business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
We are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as
well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities.
Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those
relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. For the manufacturing of our products, these laws and regulations require our
suppliers to obtain permits for operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee
our suppliers’ compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and
permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of
manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Such non-compliance from our
manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply, higher sourcing costs, and/or reputational damage for us. We could also be held liable for any and
all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our current or
former facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you
that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying
with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous
substances will not have a material adverse effect on us.
Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China
are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations
affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that
the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to
such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in
excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement
regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain
of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us.
30
Table of Contents
Certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund
Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal
or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator
did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange
for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for
cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in
Sunnyvale, California. Although we have not been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In
addition, contamination that has not been identified could exist at our other facilities.
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that
use “conflict” minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We continue to incur additional costs associated with
complying with these requirements, such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process, determining the source of any conflict
minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation, the European Union, China
and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. Customers
are increasingly seeking information about the source of minerals used in our supply chain beyond those addressed in laws and regulations. Given the
complexity of mineral supply chains, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover, we
are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as “conflict free.” If we cannot
satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor’s products.
In addition to our company, customers, governments and authorities continue to be focused on eliminating risks of forced labor in supply chains which may
increase the cost of our compliance program. For example, the United States Uyghur Forced Labor Prevent Act prohibits goods mined, produced or
manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People’s Republic of China, or by certain entities, from entering the United
States under the presumption of being made with forced labor. Germany’s federal procurement office, in collaboration with the Bitkom trade association, has
issued supply chain labor requirements. In addition, the United Kingdom, Australia and the State of California have enacted laws that require us to disclose our
policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain. Several customers have also issued expectations to
eliminate these occurrences, if any, that may impact us. While we have a Human Rights Policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices
in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance to these laws and expectations. We may face enforcement liability
and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectations. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we
cannot satisfy their forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitor’s product.
Merger, Acquisition and Integration Risks
Acquisitions, joint ventures and/or investments and the failure to integrate acquired businesses, could disrupt our business and/or dilute or
adversely affect the price of our common stock.
Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer
demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or
technologies or through joint ventures or investments rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture
candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures.
31
Table of Contents
For example, on February 14, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Xilinx and on May 26, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Pensando. While we believe
these acquisitions will result in certain benefits, including certain operational synergies and cost efficiencies, and drive product innovations, achieving these
anticipated benefits will depend on successfully combining our and the acquired companies’ businesses together. It is not certain that the acquired companies
can be successfully integrated with our business in a timely manner or at all, or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized for a variety of reasons,
including, but not limited to: our inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner; diversion of capital and other
resources, including management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the integration; failure to leverage the
increased scale of the combined businesses quickly and effectively; coordinating and integrating in countries in which we have not previously operated; the
potential impact of the acquisitions on our relationships with employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; the impairment of relationships with, or the loss of,
the acquired companies’ employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; adverse changes in general economic conditions in regions in which we and the
acquired companies operate; potential litigation associated with the acquisitions; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture; difficulties in managing
the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and difficulties with integrating and
upgrading our and the acquired companies’ financial reporting systems. Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in
increased costs, decreases in expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention, which could materially impact the combined company. In
addition, even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized within the anticipated time
frame or at all. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions and negatively impact the combined company. If we
cannot successfully integrate our and the acquired companies’ businesses and operations, or if there are delays in combining the businesses, it could
negatively impact our ability to develop or sell new products and impair our ability to grow our business, which in turn could adversely affect our financial
condition and operating results.
Acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently, we
may not achieve anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, which could harm our operating results. In addition, to complete an acquisition, we may
issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and/or incur debt, assume
contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, if
such acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or
at all. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture, we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired
business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us.
Acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could harm our business. Also, any failure on our part
to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business. We may not adequately assess the risks of new business
initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered. Furthermore, we may not achieve the objectives and expectations
with respect to future operations, products and services. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs, and there is no guarantee that the
JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it
could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
In addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our business initiatives. For example, we may not realize the expected benefits from the THATIC
JV’s expected future performance, including the receipt of any future milestone payments and any royalties from certain licensed intellectual property. In June
2019, the BIS added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. We are complying with U.S. law pertaining to the Entity
List designation.

Table of Contents
Any impairment of our tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our financial
position and results of operations.
We account for certain acquisitions, including the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC
805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible
assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of such assets and
liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on
our consolidated balance sheet.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and intangible assets including goodwill will be
tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we
would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to
the determination of fair value. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as
significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new
products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of
impairment. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in
the impairment of goodwill and may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial
position and results of operations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Risks
The agreements governing our notes, our guarantees of the Assumed Xilinx Notes, and our Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us
that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.
The indenture governing our 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 and 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 contains various covenants that limit our ability to, among
other things: create liens on certain assets to secure debt, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate with, merge into or sell, convey or
lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other person.
Additionally, in connection with the acquisition of Xilinx, we entered into supplemental indentures for the Assumed Xilinx Notes pursuant to which all obligations
of Xilinx under the Assumed Xilinx Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by us. The indentures governing the Assumed Xilinx
Notes also contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, create certain liens on principal property or the capital stock of certain
subsidiaries, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal property, and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all
or substantially all our assets, taken as a whole, to another person.
We also have a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion (Revolving Credit Agreement). Our Revolving Credit
Agreement contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, incur liens and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). In addition, our Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a
minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. The agreements governing our notes and our Revolving Credit Agreement
contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under certain agreements with respect to other indebtedness would result in cross defaults under the
indentures or the Revolving Credit Agreement. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay indebtedness
when due in an amount in excess of (i) $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures (to the extent such default would result in the acceleration
of such indebtedness) governing our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes), and (ii) $500 million would cause a cross default under the
Revolving Credit Agreement (to the extent such default (other than the failure to repay indebtedness) would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness).
The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our Revolving Credit
Agreement to declare all amounts outstanding under the indentures or the Revolving Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders
or the trustee under the indentures governing our 2.125% Notes or
33
Table of Contents
the lenders under our Revolving Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay
those borrowings.
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual
obligations.
Our total debt principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion. Our indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial
obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service
payments; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse
economic and industry conditions.
We enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain accounts receivables, which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the
event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons, and are not included in our indebtedness. We could become obligated to repurchase such
accounts receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certain circumstances, such as where a commercial
dispute arises between us and an account debtor.
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements. Also, if we cannot generate sufficient revenue and
operating cash flow, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other
strategic investments.
Our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate
significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic, financial and business conditions along with other factors, many of which are beyond
our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital requirements. If we
are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our
existing debt or obtain additional financing.
In addition, our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the
availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial
drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, or other competitive factors
require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are
required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results
could decline.
Our inability to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or
other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and
our business would be materially adversely affected.
General Risks
Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
We maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer
foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities, operated
by third-party manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. We also depend on third-party subcontractors to provide shipment services. We also
have international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 66% for the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect that
international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future.
34
Table of Contents
The political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific
country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and
restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws;
changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight
rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our
overseas facilities; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with United States laws and regulations related to international
operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the United States and other
countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus or the DNR or LNR regions of
Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and Taiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan based third-party wafer
foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
In addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters and climate change such as earthquakes,
tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, droughts, fires, extreme heat and volcanic eruptions that disrupt our operations, or those of our manufacturers, vendors or
customers. For example, our Santa Clara and San Jose operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and
employees in regions that have experienced extreme weather such as prolonged heat waves, wildfires and freezing. Extreme weather events can also disrupt
the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in
which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola),
safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example,
governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will
continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures have, and will continue to have, an effect on our business operations and practices.
In addition, many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union’s general Data Protection Regulation
and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments. The European Union’s
General Data Protection Regulation imposes significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-
compliance.
Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production and shipment delays, general business
interruptions, the inability to obtain, or delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well
as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to international customers, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer
payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could
ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.
We may incur future impairments of our technology license purchases.
We license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current
assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. Factors such as the
life of the assets, changes in competing technologies, and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of
these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges.

Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business.
Much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive employees. Competition for
highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have
desired skills and experience. If we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our
business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. To help attract, retain and
motivate our executives and qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted
stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based
compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened,
which could harm our results of operations. Also, if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create great personal wealth for
our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel. In addition, any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract
and retain key employees.
Our stock price is subject to volatility.
Our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The trading price of our stock may
fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates
by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public,
interest rate changes, inflation, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations
could impact the value of our equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, volatility in our stock price could
adversely affect our business and financing opportunities.
In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $4 billion of our common stock (Existing Repurchase Program). In February
2022, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program in addition to our Existing Repurchase Program to purchase up to $8 billion of our
outstanding common stock in the open market (collectively referred to as the Repurchase Program). The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire
any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Our stock repurchases could affect the trading price of our
stock, the volatility of our stock price, reduce our cash reserves, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which may result in a decrease in our
stock price.
Worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products.
Worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United States has been and may continue to be involved
in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military
unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may
negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or
those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more
expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the
United States economy and worldwide financial markets.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the
other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Introduction
In this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
(collectively, “us,” “our” or “AMD”), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial
condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are
not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.
Overview
2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic
acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware
acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a
significant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.
With the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,
we expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data
processing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to
provide the industry’s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of
ownership for leading-edge data centers.
Our 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net
revenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%
increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue
primarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion
of Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments
driven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,
was 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.
Operating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by
amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The
decrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate
principal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.
We took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes,
consisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of
4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum, and the
4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum. The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured
obligations.
40
Table of Contents
We also entered into a revolving credit agreement in June 2022. The agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate
principal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. In November 2022, we established a
new commercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of
$3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par
and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper
outstanding.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 36.3 million shares of
common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, $6.5 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program.
The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
We continued executing our product technology roadmap by delivering a number of new leadership products and technologies during 2022. For Data Center,
we launched our 4th Gen AMD EPYC™ processors with next-generation architecture, technology and features, and designed to deliver optimizations across
market segments and applications, while helping businesses free data center resources to create additional workload processing and accelerate output. We
also unveiled our 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors with AMD 3D V-Cache technology for leadership performance in technical computing workloads. We
introduced the 7 nm Versal™ ACAP VCK5000 development card designed to offer leadership AI inference performance. We announced the availability of the
AMD Instinct™ ecosystem, the new AMD Instinct MI210 accelerator and ROCm™ 5 software. Together the AMD Instinct and ROCm ecosystem offers
exascale-class technology to a broad base of high performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) customers, designed to address the demand for
compute-accelerated data center workloads and reduce the time to insights and discoveries.
In the Embedded segment, we introduced the AMD Ryzen™ Embedded R2000 Series, second-generation mid-range system-on-chip processors optimized for
a wide range of industrial and robotics systems, machine vision, IoT (Internet of Things) and thin-client equipment. We also introduced the Kria™ KR260
Robotics Starter Kit, the latest addition to the Kria portfolio. The kit enables rapid development of hardware-accelerated applications for robotics, machine vision
and industrial communication and control.
For the Client segment, we introduced the Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop processors powered by the new “Zen 4” architecture for gamers, enthusiasts, and
content creators. Along with the introduction of the Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop processors, we also unveiled the new Socket AM5 platform featuring four new
chipsets. These new desktop processors are designed for gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. We introduced AMD Ryzen 7000 Mobile processors with
up to 16 “Zen 4” architecture cores. We also introduced the AMD Ryzen 6000 Series Mobile processors, built on “Zen 3+” architecture and includes AMD
RDNA™ 2 architecture based on integrated graphics. We launched the AMD Ryzen 5000 C-Series processors bringing “Zen 3” architecture to premium
Chrome OS devices for work and collaboration. The processors offer up to eight high performance x86 cores. For workstations, we introduced the new AMD
Ryzen Threadripper™ PRO 5000 WX-Series workstation processors designed for professionals to run demanding workstation applications. We also introduced
the AMD Ryzen PRO 7030 Series Mobile processors built on “Zen 3” core architecture.
In the Gaming segment, we unveiled the AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX and the Radeon RX 7900 XT gaming graphics cards that are built on next-generation
high performance, energy-efficient AMD RDNA™ 3 architecture. We announced new graphics cards to the AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series product line: the AMD
Radeon RX 6950 XT, the AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT and the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT. These new graphics cards are built on AMD RDNA 2 gaming
architecture and GDDR6 memory at up to 18Gbps. We launched the new AMD Radeon PRO GPUs including the introduction of the AMD Radeon PRO W6400
graphics card built on AMD RDNA 2 architecture.
Although the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices, we experienced limited disruptions during 2022. We
continue to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.
We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial
statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how
certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.

Table of Contents
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including
those related to our revenue, inventories, business combination, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s
expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most
difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
Revenue Allowances. Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to
determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to
which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for
rights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise
to our distributor customers.
We base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical
returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current
economic conditions, or both.
Our estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual
historical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis.
Our estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and
estimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.
We offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing promotions. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we
recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the
related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform
specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense
recognition.
We also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual
percentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual
arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product
restocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for
actual known information or events, as applicable.
Overall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our
assumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to
management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and
operating results.

Inventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions
about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each
product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as
changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer
requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling
prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be
less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative
impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling
price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin
in that period. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.
Business Combinations. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired
based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is
recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
Significant estimates in valuing developed technology, in-process research and development, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets
include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful
lives, and discount rates.
Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a
result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as
acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.
During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
Goodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection
with business combinations. Our reporting units are at the operating segment level. Our goodwill is contained within three reporting units: Data Center, Gaming
and Embedded.
We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an
impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood
of an impairment, which occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of
our reporting units to determine if the fair values of those units exceed their carrying values and an impairment to goodwill is required when a quantitative
goodwill impairment test is performed. We typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to help in determining the fair value of our reporting
units. The fair values of our reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach, which requires estimating the present value of expected
future cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the
reporting unit. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of our
reporting units in the near- and long-term, expectations of our ability to execute on our roadmap and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows.
Significant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, the determination of an
appropriate control premium that a market participant would apply to a reporting unit, and the determination of appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit
based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit.

Table of Contents
The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units are the sales and earnings growth rates
(including long-term growth rates) and discount rates. Long-term growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment and
inflation. As a result, long-term growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth or an increased competitive
environment. Discount rates, which are consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, are based upon
industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rates may be impacted by
adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, prolonged and continuing inflationary pressures, volatility in the equity and debt markets and other factors
that otherwise create or exacerbate risks in our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic
environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future
impairment charges of our reporting units’ goodwill. Based on our annual impairment testing, the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying
values.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets. Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist
and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for
impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash
flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the
assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on
appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.
When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair
value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment
recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.
Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and
judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary
differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.
We regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level
of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not
ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-
likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax
expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal.
In determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net
operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future
taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.
Through the end of 2022, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The
federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual
consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.
In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex, multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for
future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities.

Results of Operations
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, we changed our reporting segments to align our financial reporting with how we manage our business in strategic
end markets. This is consistent with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) assesses our financial performance and allocates resources. As a result,
we report our financial performance based on the following four reportable segments: Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded.
Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 4 – Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form
10-K).
Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the
year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.
The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2022 and 2021:
Year Ended

Gaming 953 934 
Embedded 2,252 44 
All Other (4,979) (409)
Total operating income (loss) $ 1,264 $ 3,648 
Data Center
Data Center net revenue of $6 billion in 2022 increased by 64%, compared to net revenue of $3.7 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher
sales of our EPYC server processors.
Data Center operating income was $1.8 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $991 million in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily
driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.
Client
Client net revenue of $6.2 billion in 2022 decreased by 10%, compared to net revenue of $6.9 billion in 2021, primarily driven by a 24% decrease in unit
shipment, partially offset by a 19% increase in average selling price. The decrease in unit shipments was due to challenging PC market conditions and
significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain experienced during the second half of 2022. The increase in average selling price was primarily
driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales.
Client operating income was $1.2 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $2.1 billion in 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven
by lower revenue and higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.
45
Table of Contents
Gaming
Gaming net revenue of $6.8 billion in 2022 increased by 21%, compared to net revenue of $5.6 billion in 2021. The increase in net revenue was driven by
higher semi-custom product sales due to higher demand for gaming console SoCs, partially offset by lower gaming graphics sales due to a decrease in unit
shipments driven by soft consumer demand given weakened macroeconomic conditions experienced in the second half of 2022.
Gaming operating income was $953 million in 2022, compared to operating income of $934 million in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily
driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below.
Embedded
Embedded net revenue of $4.6 billion in 2022 increased significantly, compared to net revenue of $246 million in 2021. The significant increase in net revenue
was primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product revenue as a result of the acquisition of Xilinx in February 2022.
Embedded operating income was $2.3 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $44 million in 2021. The significant increase in operating income was
primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product revenue.
All Other
All Other operating loss of $5.0 billion in 2022 primarily consisted of $3.5 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $1.1 billion of stock-based
compensation expense, and $452 million of acquisition-related costs, which primarily include transaction costs, amortization of Xilinx inventory fair value step-
up adjustment, and depreciation related to the Xilinx fixed assets fair value step-up adjustment, certain compensation charges related to the acquisitions of
Xilinx and Pensando, and licensing gain. All Other operating loss of $409 million in 2021 primarily consisted of $379 million of stock-based compensation
expense and $42 million of acquisition-related costs.
Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Licensing Gain, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense) and Income Taxes

Table of Contents
Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses of $5.0 billion in 2022 increased by $2.2 billion, or 76%, compared to $2.8 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily
driven by strategic investments across all of our segments, including an increase in headcount through acquisitions and organic growth.
Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses
Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $2.3 billion in 2022 increased by $888 million, or 61%, compared to $1.4 billion in 2021. The increase was
primarily due to an increase in headcount through acquisitions and organic growth, go-to-market activities, and acquisition-related costs.
Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles
In 2022, cost of sales and operating expense included $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of amortization expense from intangible assets acquired as a
result of the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando.
Licensing Gain
During 2022, we recognized $102 million of licensing gain from milestone achievement and royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV,
our two joint ventures with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd., a third-party Chinese entity. We recognized a licensing gain from royalty income of $12
million for the year ended December 25, 2021.
Interest Expense
Interest expense of $88 million in 2022 increased by $54 million compared to $34 million in 2021, primarily due to interest expense from the 2.95% Senior
Notes due 2024 and the 2.375% Senior Notes due 2030 (together, the Assumed Xilinx Notes) and the 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes issued in 2022.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income (expense), net is primarily comprised of interest income from short-term investments, changes in valuation of equity investments and foreign
currency transaction gains and losses.
Other income, net was $8 million in 2022 compared to $55 million of Other income, net in 2021. The change was primarily due to a $62 million decrease in the
fair value of equity investments in 2022 compared to an increase in fair value of $56 million from equity investments in 2021, partially offset by $65 million of
interest income driven mainly by rising interest rates in 2022 compared to losses from conversion of our convertible debt of $7 million in 2021.
Income Tax Provision (Benefit)
We recorded an income tax benefit of $122 million in 2022 and an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021, representing effective tax rates of (10%) and
14%, respectively. The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million foreign-derived
intangible income tax benefit and $241 million of research and development tax credits.
Through the end of fiscal year 2022, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax
attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or
dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.
International Sales
International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 66% in 2022 and 72% in 2021. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant
portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.9 billion compared to $3.6 billion as of December 25, 2021. The
increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily driven by the $2.4 billion of cash and $1.6 billion of short-term investments
acquired from the Xilinx acquisition, $1.0 billion from the debt issuance of our 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes, and cash flows from operations, partially offset
by stock repurchases and cash paid for the acquisition of Pensando. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 73% as of
December 31, 2022, and 91% as of December 25, 2021.
Our operating, investing and financing cash flow activities for 2022 and 2021 were as follows:
December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021
 (In millions)
Net cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 3,565 $ 3,521 
Investing activities 1,999 (686)
Financing activities (3,264) (1,895)
Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 2,300 $ 940 
Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, which consisted primarily of $1.5 billion of the Xilinx Notes assumed as part
of the Xilinx acquisition and $1.0 billion of 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes issued during the year, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021,
respectively. We repaid $312 million of our 7.50% Senior Notes that matured in August 2022.
On April 29, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and other
banks identified therein as lenders. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal
amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022.
On November 3, 2022, we established a new commercial paper program where we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal
amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par
or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, we had
no commercial paper outstanding.
As of December 31, 2022, we had unconditional purchase commitments of approximately $8.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion are in fiscal year 2023. On an
ongoing basis, we work with our suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase commitments, taking into account business conditions.
We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper
program will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we
will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms,
or at all.
Operating Activities
Our working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations consist primarily of cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and
payments for employee-related expenditures.
48
Table of Contents
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion in 2022, primarily due to our net income of $1.3 billion in 2022, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of
$4.1 billion and net cash outflows of $1.8 billion from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and
liabilities included a $1.4 billion increase in inventories driven primarily by build of advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products, a $1.1 billion
increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and a $1.2 billion
increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2022, offset by an $931 million increase in
accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, and a $546 million increase in accrued liabilities and other driven mainly by higher
customer-related accruals.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2021, primarily due to our higher net income of $3.2 billion in 2021, adjusted for non-cash
adjustments of $1.1 billion and net cash outflows of $774 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in
operating assets and liabilities included a $640 million increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by $1.6 billion higher revenue in the fourth quarter of
2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, a $556 million increase in inventories driven by our continued increase in product build in support of customer
demand, and a $920 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2021, offset by
an $801 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, and a $526 million increase in accrued liabilities and other,
both of which were driven mainly by higher marketing accruals, and higher accrued annual employee incentives due to improved financial performance.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $2 billion in 2022, which primarily consisted of higher cash provided by maturities of short-term investments of
$4.3 billion and cash acquired as part of the acquisition of Xilinx of $2.4 billion, partially offset by higher cash used for purchases of short-term investments of
$2.7 billion, cash used in the acquisition of Pensando of $1.5 billion and $450 million for purchases of property and equipment.
Net cash used in investing activities was $686 million in 2021, which primarily consisted of higher cash used for purchases of short-term investments of
$2.1 billion and $301 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by higher cash provided by maturities of short-term investments of
$1.7 billion.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $3.3 billion in 2022, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $3.7 billion under the Repurchase
Program, higher repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $406 million and repayment of debt of $312 million, partially offset by
proceeds from the issuance of debt of $991 million and higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $167 million.
Net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 billion in 2021, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $1.8 billion under the Repurchase
Program and higher repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $237 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of
common stock under our employee equity plans of $104 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK    
Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest
our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions.
As of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income instruments, time deposits and commercial paper. Our primary aim with our
investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. In accordance with our investment policy, we place
investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer's credit rating. These securities are
subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 50 basis-point (half percentage point) increase or
decrease in interest rates compared to rates at December 31, 2022 would have affected the fair value of our cash equivalent and investment portfolio by
approximately $2.9 million.
As of December 31, 2022, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.
We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.
Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to
respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with
active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk
and market risk.
We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a
conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities
which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of
the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are
circumstances outside of our control.
Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies,
while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.
We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. All of our foreign
currency forward contracts mature within 18 months.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
NOTE 1 – The Company
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is a global semiconductor company. References herein to AMD or the Company mean Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its
consolidated subsidiaries. AMD’s products include x86 microprocessors (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), as standalone devices or as
incorporated into accelerated processing units (APUs), chipsets, data center and professional GPUs, embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip
(SoC) products, microprocessor and SoC development services and technology, data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and
Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its intellectual property (IP) portfolio.
On February 14, 2022 (the Xilinx Acquisition Date), the Company completed the acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx). On May 26, 2022 (the Pensando Acquisition
Date), the Company completed the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). See Note 5 - Business Combinations for additional information on these
acquisitions.
NOTE 2 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
Fiscal Year. The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 ended on December 31,
2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2022 consisted of 53 weeks, and fiscal 2021 and 2020 each consisted of 52 weeks.
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon
consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Reclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from
those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not
limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the
Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or
services are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all the Company’s
revenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation.
Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The
Company has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers.
Non-custom products
The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which includes original equipment
manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single
performance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under
terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount
of variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and
rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events.
57
Table of Contents
The Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special
pricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related
revenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the
program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or
marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.
Constraints of variable consideration have not been material.
Custom products
Custom products which are associated with the Company’s Gaming segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which
the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over
the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to
determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based
input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs
incurred best depict the Company’s satisfaction of its performance obligation.
Sales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. There are
no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products.
Development and intellectual property licensing agreements
From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to
use the Company’s IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or multiple performance obligations based upon the nature of the arrangements. Revenue
is recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the
licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the
license is not distinct, it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct,
revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.
From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no
performance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company’s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when
the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.
There are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving
either the sale or licensing of IP.
Inventories
The Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about
future demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes
in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In
determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as
well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The
Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase
orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or
market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required.
58
Table of Contents
Business Combinations
The Company is required to use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The acquisition method of accounting requires the Company
to allocate the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquiree based on their respective fair values as of the
acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as
goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially
with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and
margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the
assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore,
actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may
record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or
final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Goodwill
The Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that
an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the
likelihood of an impairment.
The Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and
Company-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company
does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.
If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or elects to bypass the qualitative test, a
quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company’s quantitative
impairment analysis uses a combination of the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting
unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting units. Significant estimates
and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of reporting units in the near- and long-term,
expectations of the Company’s ability to execute on roadmaps and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows. Significant estimates used in the
market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, and the determination of the appropriate multiples to apply to a
reporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit. If a reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than its
carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed
the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets
Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-
lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of
identifiable cash flows.
When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset
groups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated
fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets
held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.
When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, the Company estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over
their fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate
impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.
59
Table of Contents
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of
purchase.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for credit loss. Accounts
receivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on development services recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to
customers and semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which
revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months.
The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals.
Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the Company may
require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments if deemed necessary. The Company maintains an allowance for credit loss,
consisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical
experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit
risk.
Investments
Available for Sale Debt Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale
debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a
component of stockholders’ equity. If an available-for-sale debt security’s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether
the decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not
attributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. Classification of
available-for-sale debt securities as current or non-current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds
from sale in operations within 12 months.
Non-marketable Securities. The Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of privately-held companies are accounted for under the measurement
alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or
circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. The Company's periodic assessment of impairment is made by considering available
evidence, including the investee’s general market and industry conditions and product development status. The Company also assesses the investee’s ability to
meet business milestones, its financial condition, and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee’s need for
possible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company’s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity investments in privately-
held companies, which are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative.
Fair Value Hierarchy
The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or
liabilities. The guidance for fair value measurements requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following
categories:
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices
for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data
for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
60
Table of Contents
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the
fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted
cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of one to 15 years
for equipment, 34 to 44 years for buildings, and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated
useful economic lives of the improvements.
Leases
Operating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet. ROU assets represent the
Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the
lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In
determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not
readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the
lease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations.
Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the accounting policy to not
recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included
in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s
finance leases are immaterial.
Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions
The functional currency of the majority of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. For certain foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the
functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Gains or losses arising from translation of foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities (i.e., cumulative translation adjustment) are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
stockholders' equity.
Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and
historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates
in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been
remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings.
Marketing and Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company’s marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding
obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising
expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the
advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue.
Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $683 million, $578 million and $314 million, respectively.
61
Table of Contents
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option’s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes
model. For time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company
estimates the grant-date fair value of RSUs that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair
value of stock to be issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase plan (ESPP) using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized
over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to RSUs with performance or
market conditions (PRSUs), which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period.
Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Contingencies
From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to
income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental
matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past
conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of
reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if
any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to
new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy.
Income Taxes
The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences
between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures
deferred tax assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or
settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax
assets will be realized. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable taxing jurisdictions. In addition, the Company
recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on
examination by the jurisdictional tax authority.
Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). In 2022, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for the United States GILTI tax from recording
the tax impact in the period it is incurred to recognizing deferred taxes for temporary tax basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI tax in future years. The
change is considered preferable based on the Company’s facts and circumstances as it provides better and more timely information of expected future income
tax liabilities arising from temporary tax differences primarily associated with the Xilinx acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded
$27.3 billion of identified intangible assets (refer to Note 5 - Business Combinations), of which $16.9 billion are related to foreign operations which will be
amortized to income from operations over the assets’ estimated useful lives, but for which the Company will not receive a tax deduction under GILTI. This
accounting policy change resulted in the recording of $857 million of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the Xilinx acquisition as disclosed in Note 14 -
Income Taxes. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2022, it resulted in a decrease in the income tax provision with a corresponding increase to net
income of $296 million and an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.19, as compared to the computation under the previous accounting policy.
This accounting policy change had no material impact on the Company’s historical consolidated financial statements.

Accrued Interest on Unrecognized Tax Benefits. Prior to 2022, the Company reported any interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits as a
component of Interest expense and reported any related penalties as a component of Income tax provision (benefit). In 2022, the Company elected to change
its method of accounting for tax interest expense from Interest expense to the Income tax provision (benefit) line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
This change in classification is considered preferable as it i) better aligns classification of tax interest with the substance of the underlying tax positions, which
are managed inclusive of interest, ii) allows for greater visibility to the cost of the Company’s debt and other financing activities, and iii) better aligns with
common industry practice and provides increased comparability. This accounting policy change resulted in a decrease in Interest expense and corresponding
increase to i) Income before income taxes and equity income and ii) Income tax provision (benefit) as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of
$11 million in 2022. This accounting policy change had an immaterial effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2021 and 2020, and the Company
did not revise its previously issued consolidated financial statements for these fiscal years. This accounting policy change had no impact to net income or basic
and diluted earnings per share, or to financial statements besides the Consolidated Statements of Operations, for any period, as compared to the computation
under the previous accounting policy.

that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods for development services, IP licensing and product revenue. As of December 31, 2022, the
aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations under contracts with an original expected duration of more than one
year was $247 million, of which $213 million is expected to be recognized in the next 12 months. The revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations
does not include amounts which have an original expected duration of one year or less.
Revenue recognized over time associated with custom products and development services accounted for approximately 24%, 23% and 18% of the Company’s
revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
NOTE 4 – Segment Reporting
Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses operating
performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss). These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the reportable
segments based on management’s judgment. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company updated its segment reporting structure to align financial
reporting with the manner in which the Company manages its business in strategic end markets. The Company’s disclosed measure of segment operating
results has been updated consistent with the revised manner in which the Company’s CODM assesses the company’s financial performance and allocates
resources. All prior-period segment data have been retrospectively adjusted.
The Company’s four reportable segments are:
•the Data Center segment, which primarily includes server CPUs and GPUs, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptive SoC products for data centers;
•the Client segment, which primarily includes CPUs, accelerated processing units that integrate microprocessors and GPUs (APUs), and chipsets for
desktop and notebook personal computers;
•the Gaming segment, which primarily includes discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services; and
•the Embedded segment, which primarily includes embedded CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs, and Adaptive SoC products.
From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio.
In addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain
expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because the CODM does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating
the performance of the reportable segments. This category primarily includes amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based
compensation expense, acquisition-related costs and licensing gain.

Pensando Acquisition
On May 26, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Pensando, a leader in next-generation distributed computing,
for a transaction valued at approximately $1.9 billion. The recorded purchase consideration of $1.7 billion is net of deferred cash compensation requiring future
services and other customary closing adjustments. The acquisition of Pensando and its leading distributed services platform expands the Company’s ability to
offer leadership solutions for cloud, enterprise, and edge customers.*

The Company allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the preliminary estimates of
their fair values, which were determined using generally accepted valuation techniques based on estimates and assumptions made by management. The fair
values are subject to adjustment for up to one year after the close of the transaction as additional information is obtained. Any adjustments to the preliminary
purchase price allocation identified during the measurement period are recognized in the period in which the adjustments are determined. Adjustments to the
preliminary purchase price allocation since the completion of the acquisition resulted in an immaterial decrease to goodwill.
Goodwill arising from the Pensando acquisition was assigned to the Company’s Data Center segment. Goodwill was primarily attributed to expanded market
opportunities expected to be achieved from the integration of Pensando. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

1.The fair value of developed technology was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method.
2.Customer relationships represent the fair value of existing contractual relationships and custom er loyalty determined based on existing relationships using the income
approach, specifically the with and without method.
3.Customer backlog represents the fair value of non-cancellable customer contract orders using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings
method.
4.Product trademarks primarily relate to the Pensando product-related trademarks, and the fair value was determined by applying the income approach, specifically the
relief from royalty method.
5.The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method.
The fair value of the identified intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over the assets’ estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the
economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of sales and operating expenses.
IPR&D consists of projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, the Company recorded an indefinite-lived
intangible asset of $220 million for the fair value of these projects, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, these projects will be tested for impairment
annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these projects may be impaired. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, the
Company will begin to amortize the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives.
From the Pensando Acquisition Date to December 31, 2022, the Consolidated Statements of Operations include immaterial revenue and operating results
attributable to Pensando, which are reported under the Data Center segment.
In 2022, Pensando acquisition-related costs of $102 million was recorded under Cost of sales, Research and development, and Marketing, general and
administrative expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Acquisition-related costs are primarily comprised of direct transaction
costs, fair value adjustments for acquired inventory and certain compensation charges. The Company may incur additional acquisition-related costs in the
future related to the acquisition.
Xilinx Acquisition
On February 14, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx, a leading provider of adaptive computing
solutions, for a total purchase consideration of $48.8 billion ($46.4 billion, net of cash acquired of $2.4 billion). The acquisition of Xilinx expands the Company’s
product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies. With the
acquisition of Xilinx, the Company now offers FPGAs, Adaptive SoC products and ACAP products. The purchase consideration consisted of $48.5 billion of fair
value of 429 million shares of the Company’s common stock issued to Xilinx stockholders and $275 million of fair value of replacement equity awards
attributable to services rendered pre-combination. As the transaction closed prior to the opening of markets on the Xilinx Acquisition Date, the fair value of the
common stock issued to Xilinx stockholders was based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on February 11, 2022 of $113.18 per share.
The financial results of Xilinx are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the Xilinx Acquisition Date to December 31, 2022 and are

and the principal outstanding of the Assumed Xilinx Notes is being amortized through interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. The Assumed Xilinx
Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1. The indentures
governing the Assumed Xilinx Notes contain various covenants which limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, create certain liens on principal
property or the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal property, and consolidate or
merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to another person.
3.924% Senior Notes Due 2032 and 4.393% Senior Notes Due 2052
On June 9, 2022, the Company issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes. The 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes
are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. The interest is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on
December 1, 2022. The 3.924% and 4.393% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture dated June 9, 2022 between the Company and US Bank Trust
Company, National Association as trustee. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes was
$1.0 billion.

The Company may redeem some or all of the 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes prior to March 1, 2032 and December 1, 2051, respectively, at a price equal to
the greater of the present value of the principal amount and future interest through the maturity of the 3.924% Notes or 4.393% Notes or 100% of the principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 3.924% Notes or 4.393% Notes in
the event that the Company undergoes a change of control as defined in the indenture, at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes.

Revolving Credit Facility
On April 29, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and the
other banks identified therein as lenders. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed $3.0 billion (subject to certain terms and conditions).
Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement can be Secure Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Loans or Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the
Revolving Credit Agreement) at the Company's option. Each SOFR Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable SOFR Rate plus a
margin based on the Company's Debt Ratings (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) from time to time of between 0.625% and 1.250%. Each Base
Rate Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus a margin based on the Company's
Debt Ratings from time to time of between 0.000% and 0.250%. In addition, the Company has agreed to pay a commitment fee based on the Company's Debt
Ratings from time to time of between 0.050% and 0.125% (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement). The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains a
sustainability-linked pricing component which provides for interest rate and facility fee reductions or increases based on the Company meeting or missing
targets related to environmental sustainability, specifically greenhouse gas emissions.
The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants and events of default applicable
to the Company and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit facility but may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for
payment of expenses in connection with working capital and general corporate expenses.

Hedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Accounting Hedges
The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to future forecasted
transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These contracts generally mature within 24 months and are designated as accounting
hedges. As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the notional value of the Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as
cash flow hedges was $1.9 billion and $894 million, respectively. The fair value of these contracts, recorded as a liability, was $27 million as of December 31,
2022. The fair value of these contracts as of December 25, 2021 was not material.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Accounting Hedges
The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on certain receivables or
payables denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These forward contracts generally mature within 3 months and are not designated as
accounting hedges. As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the notional value of these outstanding contracts was $485 million and $291 million,
respectively. The fair value of these contracts was not material as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021.

NOTE 10 – Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in time deposits, available-for-sale
debt securities and trade receivables.
The Company places its investments with high credit quality financial institutions. At the time an investment is made, investments in commercial paper of
industrial firms and financial institutions are rated A1, P1, F1 or better. The Company invests in bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase
agreements, each of which have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral.
The Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse
customers make up the Company’s customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. One customer accounted for approximately 18% of the total consolidated
accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2022. Two customers each accounted for approximately 20% and 15% of the total consolidated accounts
receivable balance as of December 25, 2021. However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant
credit risk based on past collection experience and review of their current credit quality.
The Company is exposed to credit losses from nonperformance by counterparties on foreign currency hedge contracts. These counterparties are large global
institutions, and to date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.
NOTE 11 – Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the
period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the Company’s stock options, RSUs (including PRSUs), common
stock to be issued under the ESPP and warrants. Potentially dilutive shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026
(2.125% Notes) are calculated using the if-converted method.
The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share:

shares for 2022 and 2021, respectively, were not included in the earnings per share calculation because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

Stock Repurchase Program
In May 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing up to $4 billion of the Company’s common stock (Existing
Repurchase Program). In February 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program in addition to the Existing Repurchase
Program to purchase up to $8 billion of outstanding common stock in the open market (collectively referred to as the “Repurchase Program”).
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 36.3 million shares of its common stock under the Repurchase Program for $3.7 billion.
As of December 31, 2022, $6.5 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. This Repurchase Program does not obligate the
Company to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company’s employee equity programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On April 29, 2004, the Company’s
stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the 2004 Plan). In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company introduced the
2017 ESPP, as amended and restated (the 2017 Plan).
Under the 2004 Plan, stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a three-year period from the date of grant and expire within seven years after
the grant date. Unvested shares that are reacquired by the Company from forfeited outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued
as new awards.
Under the 2004 Plan, the Company can grant (i) stock options, and (ii) RSUs, including time-based RSUs and PRSUs.
Stock Options. Under the 2004 Plan, nonstatutory and incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price of the shares subject to each nonstatutory
stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The
exercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise.
Time-based RSUs. Time-based RSUs are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a specific
number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied.
PRSUs. PRSUs can be granted to certain of the Company’s senior executives. The performance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial
performance and/or market conditions. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to an award recipient before
adjusting based on the Company’s financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual number of shares that a grant
recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 0% to 250% of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree of achievement of the
performance target designated by each individual award.

Table of Contents
ESPP. Under the 2017 Plan, eligible employees who participate in an offering period may have up to 15% of their eligible earnings withheld, up to certain
limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last business day of the six-month offering
period. The offering periods commence in May and November each year.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 32 million shares of common stock that were available for future grants and 28 million shares reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vesting of unvested RSUs, including PRSUs, under the 2004 Plan. In addition, the Company
had 36 million shares of common stock that were available for issuance under the 2017 plan. With the acquisition of Xilinx, the Company assumed the Xilinx,
Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (2007 Plan) and may grant stock options and awards under this plan. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 18 million
shares of common stock that were available for future grants under the 2007 Plan.

Total stock-based compensation expense, net of income taxes $ 902 $ 321 $ 232 
Stock Options. The weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $44.35, $46.07 and $38.49 per
share, respectively, using the following assumptions:
December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020

Risk-free interest rate 3.00 % 0.69 % 0.18 %
Expected dividends — % — % — %
Expected life (in years) 4.75 4.55 4.30
The Company uses a combination of the historical volatility of its common stock and the implied volatility for publicly traded options on the Company’s common
stock as the expected volatility assumption. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve with a term that
approximates the expected life of the option grant at the date closest to the option grant date. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not
expect to pay dividends in the near future. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are
expected to remain outstanding.

The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $122 million in 2022 and an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021, representing effective tax rates of
(10%) and 14%, respectively. The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million FDII tax
benefit and $241 million of research and development (R&D) tax credits.
Beginning in 2022, provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 require the Company to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures rather than
deducting the costs as incurred. The capitalization resulted in an increase in 2022 taxable income which also increased the income eligible for the FDII tax
benefit. Additionally, there was a pre-tax loss incurred outside of the U.S. primarily due to the GAAP amortization of Xilinx acquisition-related items and
therefore, the Company recorded a corresponding tax benefit associated with the reversal of the previously established GILTI deferred tax liability.
As a part of the Xilinx acquisition and as a result of certain employment and operational commitments the Company has made in Singapore, the Company has
been granted a Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) that is effective through 2031. The DEI reduces the local tax on Singapore income from a statutory
rate of 17% to 5% through 2031. Due to the current year pre-tax loss, the Company did not receive any income tax or EPS benefit.

The Company recorded an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021 and an income tax benefit of $1.2 billion in 2020, representing effective tax rates of
14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision in 2021 was a result of higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147
million of FDII benefit, $78 million of R&D tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers’
compensation.
The income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the U.S. This benefit was partially offset
by approximately $10 million of withholding tax expense related to cross-border transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes and $75 million increase in
valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits, which are reflected as part of the state taxes and foreign rate benefit in the reconciliation table
above.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the balances for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31,
2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows:

As a result of the acquisition of Xilinx, the Company recorded $4.3 billion of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of
the acquired intangible assets, including $857 million of GILTI net deferred tax liability.
Additionally, as the result of the new R&D capitalization tax law effective in 2022, the capitalized amounts resulted in increased current year taxable income, but
which are deductible as amortized in future periods. Therefore, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset for the capitalized R&D expenditures.

Under current U.S. tax law, the impact of future distributions of undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested are anticipated to be subject to withholding
taxes from local jurisdictions and non-conforming U.S. state jurisdictions. The amount of cumulative undistributed earnings that are permanently reinvested that
could be subject to withholding taxes are $460 million as of December 31, 2022.
Through the end of fiscal year 2022, the Company continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and
foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss
year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.
The Company’s U.S. federal and state net operating losses carryforwards as of December 31, 2022, were $435 million and $476 million, respectively. Net
operating losses (NOLs) may be subject to limitations by the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions. $71 million of U.S. federal NOLs will expire
between 2023 and 2037, and $364 million of federal NOLs have no expiration date, and the state NOLs will expire at various dates through 2042. The
difference between the amount of federal NOLs which are recorded on the Company’s balance sheet as deferred tax assets and their related valuation
allowance, and the amounts reported on the Company’s tax returns are the result of uncertain tax positions the Company has taken during the current year and
for which an income tax reserve has been recorded. The federal tax credits of $12 million will expire at various dates between 2023 and 2042. The state tax
credits of $722 million will expire at various dates between 2023 through 2038 except for California R&D credit, which does not expire. The Company also has
$595 million of credit carryforward in Canada that will expire between 2026 and 2040.
The Company also recorded $142 million of current tax payable as of the Xilinx acquisition date. Additionally, the Company assumed $203 million of long-term
liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including $12 million of interest, as well as $321 million of long-term liabilities for transition tax payable over three years.
Included in the assumed liabilities for uncertain tax positions is a tax position with respect to whether stock-based compensation from Xilinx’s cost sharing
arrangement should be shared among cost share participants. The Company has concluded that the law was unsettled and believes the current uncertain tax
position liability is sufficient and will continue to monitor developments in relevant tax court cases.+

2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities within
the provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had $81.3 million of accrued penalties and interest related to
unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 including $12 million assumed from the Xilinx acquisition. The Company had no material amounts of
accrued interest and accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. As of December 31, 2022 and
December 25, 2021, the Company had long-term income tax liabilities of $1.3 billion and $189 million, respectively, recorded under Other long-term liabilities in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax. The material
jurisdiction in which the Company is subject to potential examination by the taxing authority is the United States, where tax years from 2008 are open for audit.
Pre-acquisition Xilinx U.S. tax returns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 are currently under audit by the IRS.
It is possible the Company may have tax audits close in the next 12 months that could materially change the balance of the uncertain tax benefits; however, the
timing of tax audit closures and settlements are highly uncertain. The Company and its subsidiaries have several foreign and U.S. state audits in process at any
one point in time.

Warranties and Indemnities
The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to its approved specifications and be free from defects in material and
workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year. The Company may also offer one to three-year limited warranties based on product type and
negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The Company accrues warranty costs to Cost of sales at the time of sale of warranted products.
Changes in the Company’s estimated liability for product warranty during 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

In addition to product warranties, the Company from time to time in its normal course of business indemnifies other parties with whom it enters into contractual
relationships, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. In these limited matters, the
Company has agreed to hold certain third parties harmless against specific types of claims or losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or
covenants, third-party claims that the Company’s products when used for their intended purpose(s) and under specific conditions infringe the intellectual
property rights of a third party, or other specified claims made against the indemnified party. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of
liability under these indemnification obligations due to the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim and
indemnification provision. Historically, payments made by the Company under these obligations have not been material. In addition, the impact from changes in
estimates for pre-existing warranties has been immaterial.
NOTE 17 – Contingencies
Quarterhill Inc. Litigation
On July 2, 2018, three entities named Aquila Innovations, Inc. (Aquila), Collabo Innovations, Inc. (Collabo), and Polaris Innovations, Ltd. (Polaris), filed separate
patent infringement complaints against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Aquila alleges that the Company
infringes two patents (6,239,614 and 6,895,519) relating to power management; Collabo alleges that the Company infringes one patent (7,930,575) related to
power management; and Polaris alleges that the Company infringes two patents (6,728,144 and 8,117,526) relating to control or use of dynamic random-
access memory, or DRAM. Each of the three complaints seeks unspecified monetary damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against the Company;
Aquila and Collabo also seek enhanced damages. Aquila, Collabo, and Polaris each appear to be related to a patent assertion entity named Quarterhill Inc.
(formerly WiLAN Inc.).
On May 14, 2020, at the request of Polaris, the Court dismissed all claims related to one of the two patents in suite in the Polaris case. On June 10, 2020, the
Court granted AMD’s motions to stay the Polaris and Aquila cases pending the completion of inter partes review of each of the patents-in-suit in those cases by
the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. On February 22, 2021, February 26, 2021, and March 10, 2021, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued final written
decisions in inter partes reviews invalidating all asserted claims of the remaining Polaris and Aquila patents.
On May 10, 2021, Aquila filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for the IPR decision regarding U.S. Patent No. 6,895,519. On

Environmental Matters
The Company is named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List.
Since 1981, the Company has discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and
conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States
in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.
In 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites.
The Company has entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties
have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. The Company remains
responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their
obligations under the settlement agreements.
To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of
approximately $3.9 million and has not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future
remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. The Company believes that any amount in addition to what has already
been accrued would not be material.
Other Legal Matters
The Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on the
management’s current knowledge, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and December 25,
2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for the United States Global
Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax to recognize deferred taxes for temporary tax basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI tax in future years.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required
to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit
matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Inventory Valuation
Description of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the Company’s net inventory balance was $3,771 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the estimated net realizable
value after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory quantities exceeding forecasted demand and by considering recent
historical activity as well as anticipated demand. Auditing management’s inventory carrying value adjustments involved
significant judgment because the estimates are based on several factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive
conditions outside the Company's control. In estimating inventory carrying value adjustments, management developed
assumptions such as forecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive to the competitiveness of
product offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could
be affected by future economic and market conditions.
How We Addressed the
Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the
Company's inventory carrying value adjustment determination process, including the basis for developing the above-described
assumptions and management’s judgments.
Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions and judgments
and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of inventory carrying value
adjustments. For instance, we compared the quantities and carrying value of on-hand inventories to related unit sales, both
historical and forecasted, assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimates of future sales prices by analyzing historical
sales and evaluating any factors that may impact sales prices, and evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of
management’s adjustments to such sales forecasts by analyzing potential technological changes in line with product life cycles.
We also assessed the accuracy of forecasts underlying management's estimates by comparing management’s historical
forecasts to actual results, evaluated industry and market factors and performed sensitivity analyses over the significant
assumptions used by management to evaluate necessary changes in the inventory carrying value adjustments.

Business Combination
Description of the MatterDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (“Xilinx”) for consideration of $48.8 billion, as
disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.
Auditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Xilinx was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the
Company’s determination of the fair value of certain identified intangible assets, principally consisting of developed technology
and customer relationships. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values
to underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The Company used a discounted cash flow
model to measure the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to
estimate the value of these intangible assets included certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results,
specifically, revenue growth rates, technology migration curves, and time to recreate customer relationships. These significant
assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.
How We Addressed the
Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s
accounting for the acquisition. This included testing controls over the estimation process supporting the recognition and
measurement of the developed technology and customer relationships intangible assets, including the valuation models and
underlying assumptions used to develop such estimates.
To test the estimated fair value of the developed technology and customer relationships intangible assets, we performed audit
procedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company's selection of the valuation methodology, evaluating the
methods and significant assumptions used by the Company, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying
data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. For example, we compared the significant assumptions to current
industry, market and economic trends and to the Company's budgets and forecasts, and Xilinx’s historical operating results. We
involved our valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology used by the Company and significant
assumptions included in the fair value estimates. Our valuation specialists’ procedures included, among others, developing a
range of independent estimates for the discount rates used in the valuation models and comparing those to the discount rates
selected by management.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In
our opinion, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated
February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure
controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.
As of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions of
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our
periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as
necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that we adjust as circumstances merit. Based on the foregoing, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the
end of the period covered by this report.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and
procedures that:
1.Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company;
2.Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and
3.Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving
financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns
resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of
such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to
reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
Company.

Table of Contents
Management has used the 2013 framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has
concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 at the reasonable assurance level. Our
independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2022, which is included in Part II, Item 8, above.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. We are currently in the process of integrating the Xilinx and Pensando
operations, control processes and information systems into our systems and control environment. We believe that we have taken the necessary steps to
monitor and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting during this integration.
ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION
The U.S. government has designated the Russian Federal Security Service (the FSB) as a blocked party under Executive Order 13382. In addition, the U.S.
Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control has issued General License No. 1B (the OFAC General License), which generally authorizes
certain licensing, permitting, certification, notification, and related transactions with the FSB as may be required for the importation, distribution, or use of
information technology products in the Russian Federation.
As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 26, 2022, Xilinx, which we acquired on February 14, 2022,
previously authorized prior to such acquisition certain third-party resellers in Russia to periodically file notifications with, or apply for import licenses and permits
from, the FSB on its behalf in connection with the importation of its products into the Russian Federation, as permitted under the OFAC General License.
Subsequent to February 14, 2022, but during the fiscal quarter ended March 26, 2022, third-party resellers filed additional notifications with and/or applied for
import licenses and permits from the FSB on behalf of Xilinx. During the fiscal quarter ended March 26, 2022, we and our subsidiaries, including Xilinx,
suspended shipments to the Russian Federation.
There was no gross revenue or net profits of ours or any of our subsidiaries directly associated with these filing activities. We and our subsidiaries do not sell
products or provide services to the FSB.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Note 2 of Notes to the consolidated financial statements of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. included in its Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2022 describes a change in the method of accounting for tax interest expense from Interest expense to the
Income tax provision (benefit) line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There are no authoritative criteria for determining a
‘preferable’  method for classifying interest expense associated with unrecognized tax benefits based on the particular circumstances;
however , we conclude that such change in the method of accounting is to an acceptable alternative method which, based on your
business judgment to make this change and for the stated reasons, is preferable in your circumstances.  
Very truly yours,
